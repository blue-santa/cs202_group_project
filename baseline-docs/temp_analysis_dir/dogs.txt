HOLLANDMy dear dumb friend, low lying there,    A willing vassal at my feet;Glad partner of my home and fare,    My shadow in the street;I look into your great brown eyes,    Where love and loyal homage shine,And wonder where the difference lies    Between your soul and mine! . . . . . . .I scan the whole broad earth around    For that one heart which, leal and true,Bears friendship without end or bound,    And find the prize in you. . . . . . . .Ah, Blanco! did I worship God    As truly as you worship me,Or follow where my Master trod    With your humility:Did I sit fondly at His feet    As you, dear Blanco, sit at mine,And watch Him with a love as sweet,    My life would grow divine!STICKEENIn the summer of 1880 I set out from Fort Wrangel in a canoe tocontinue the exploration of the icy region of southeastern Alaska,begun in the fall of 1879. After the necessary provisions, blankets,etc., had been collected and stowed away, and my Indian crew were intheir places ready to start, while a crowd of their relatives andfriends on the wharf were bidding them good-by and good-luck, mycompanion, the Rev. S.H. Young, for whom we were waiting, at last cameaboard, followed by a little black dog, that immediately made himselfat home by curling up in a hollow among the baggage. I like dogs, butthis one seemed so small and worthless that I objected to his going,and asked the missionary why he was taking him.â€œSuch a little helpless creature will only be in the way,â€ I said; â€œyouhad better pass him up to the Indian boys on the wharf, to be takenhome to play with the children. This trip is not likely to be good fortoy-dogs. The poor silly thing will be in rain and snow for weeks ormonths, and will require care like a baby.â€But his master assured me that he would be no trouble at all; that hewas a perfect wonder of a dog, could endure cold and hunger like abear, swim like a seal, and was wondrous wise and cunning, etc., makingout a list of virtues to show he might be the most interesting memberof the party.Nobody could hope to unravel the lines of his ancestry. In all thewonderfully mixed and varied dog-tribe I never saw any creature verymuch like him, though in some of his sly, soft, gliding motions andgestures he brought the fox to mind. He was short-legged andbunchy-bodied, and his hair, though smooth, was long and silky andslightly waved, so that when the wind was at his back it ruffled,making him look shaggy. At first sight his only noticeable feature washis fine tail, which was about as airy and shady as a squirrelâ€™s, andwas carried curling forward almost to his nose. On closer inspectionyou might notice his thin sensitive ears, and sharp eyes with cunningtan-spots above them. Mr. Young told me that when the little fellow wasa pup about the size of a woodrat he was presented to his wife by anIrish prospector at Sitka, and that on his arrival at Fort Wrangel hewas adopted with enthusiasm by the Stickeen Indians as a sort of newgood-luck totem, was named â€œStickeenâ€ for the tribe, and became auniversal favorite; petted, protected, and admired wherever he went,and regarded as a mysterious fountain of wisdom.On our trip he soon proved himself a queer characterâ€”odd, concealed,independent, keeping invincibly quiet, and doing many little puzzlingthings that piqued my curiosity. As we sailed week after week throughthe long intricate channels and inlets among the innumerable islandsand mountains of the coast, he spent most of the dull days in sluggishease, motionless, and apparently as unobserving as if in deep sleep.But I discovered that somehow he always knew what was going on. Whenthe Indians were about to shoot at ducks or seals, or when anythingalong the shore was exciting our attention, he would rest his chin onthe edge of the canoe and calmly look out like a dreamy-eyed tourist.And when he heard us talking about making a landing, he immediatelyroused himself to see what sort of a place we were coming to, and madeready to jump overboard and swim ashore as soon as the canoe neared thebeach. Then, with a vigorous shake to get rid of the brine in his hair,he ran into the woods to hunt small game. But though always the firstout of the canoe, he was always the last to get into it. When we wereready to start he could never be found, and refused to come to ourcall. We soon found out, however, that though we could not see him atsuch times, he saw us, and from the cover of the briers and huckleberrybushes in the fringe of the woods was watching the canoe with wary eye.For as soon as we were fairly off he came trotting down the beach,plunged into the surf, and swam after us, knowing well that we wouldcease rowing and take him in. When the contrary little vagabond camealongside, he was lifted by the neck, held at armâ€™s length a moment todrip, and dropped aboard. We tried to cure him of this trick bycompelling him to swim a long way, as if we had a mind to abandon him;but this did no good: the longer the swim the better he seemed to likeit.Though capable of great idleness, he never failed to be ready for allsorts of adventures and excursions. One pitch-dark rainy night welanded about ten oâ€™clock at the mouth of a salmon stream when the waterwas phosphorescent. The salmon were running, and the myriad fins of theonrushing multitude were churning all the stream into a silvery glow,wonderfully beautiful and impressive in the ebon darkness. To get agood view of the show I set out with one of the Indians and sailed upthrough the midst of it to the foot of a rapid about half a mile fromcamp, where the swift current dashing over rocks made the luminous glowmost glorious. Happening to look back down the stream, while the Indianwas catching a few of the struggling fish, I saw a long spreading fanof light like the tail of a comet, which we thought must be made bysome big strange animal that was pursuing us. On it came with itsmagnificent train, until we imagined we could see the monsterâ€™s headand eyes; but it was only Stickeen, who, finding I had left the camp,came swimming after me to see what was up.When we camped early, the best hunter of the crew usually went to thewoods for a deer, and Stickeen was sure to be at his heels, provided Ihad not gone out. For, strange to say, though I never carried a gun, healways followed me, forsaking the hunter and even his master to sharemy wanderings. The days that were too stormy for sailing I spent in thewoods, or on the adjacent mountains, wherever my studies called me; andStickeen always insisted on going with me, however wild the weather,gliding like a fox through dripping huckleberry bushes and thornytangles of panax and rubus, scarce stirring their rain-laden leaves;wading and wallowing through snow, swimming icy streams, skipping overlogs and rocks and the crevasses of glaciers with the patience andendurance of a determined mountaineer, never tiring or gettingdiscouraged. Once he followed me over a glacier the surface of whichwas so crusty and rough that it cut his feet until every step wasmarked with blood; but he trotted on with Indian fortitude until Inoticed his red track, and, taking pity on him, made him a set ofmoccasins out of a handkerchief. However great his troubles he neverasked help or made any complaint, as if, like a philosopher, he hadlearned that without hard work and suffering there could be no pleasureworth having.Yet none of us was able to make out what Stickeen was really good for.He seemed to meet danger and hardships without anything like reason,insisted on having his own way, never obeyed an order, and the huntercould never set him on anything, or make him fetch the birds he shot.His equanimity was so steady it seemed due to want of feeling; ordinarystorms were pleasures to him, and as for mere rain, he flourished in itlike a vegetable. No matter what advances you might make, scarce aglance or a tail-wag would you get for your pains. But though he wasapparently as cold as a glacier and about as impervious to fun, I triedhard to make his acquaintance, guessing there must be something worthwhile hidden beneath so much courage, endurance, and love ofwild-weathery adventure. No superannuated mastiff or bulldog grown oldin office surpassed this fluffy midget in stoic dignity. He sometimesreminded me of a small, squat, unshakable desert cactus. For he neverdisplayed a single trace of the merry, tricksy, elfish fun of theterriers and collies that we all know, nor of their touching affectionand devotion. Like children, most small dogs beg to be loved andallowed to love; but Stickeen seemed a very Diogenes, asking only to belet alone: a true child of the wilderness, holding the even tenor ofhis hidden life with the silence and serenity of nature. His strengthof character lay in his eyes. They looked as old as the hills, and asyoung, and as wild. I never tired of looking into them: it was likelooking into a landscape; but they were small and rather deep-set, andhad no explaining lines around them to give out particulars. I wasaccustomed to look into the faces of plants and animals, and I watchedthe little sphinx more and more keenly as an interesting study. Butthere is no estimating the wit and wisdom concealed and latent in ourlower fellow mortals until made manifest by profound experiences; forit is through suffering that dogs as well as saints are developed andmade perfect.After exploring the Sumdum and Tahkoo fiords and their glaciers, wesailed through Stephenâ€™s Passage into Lynn Canal and thence through IcyStrait into Cross Sound, searching for unexplored inlets leading towardthe great fountain ice-fields of the Fairweather Range. Here, while thetide was in our favor, we were accompanied by a fleet of icebergsdrifting out to the ocean from Glacier Bay. Slowly we paddled aroundVancouverâ€™s Point, Wimbledon, our frail canoe tossed like a feather onthe massive heaving swells coming in past Cape Spenser. For miles thesound is bounded by precipitous mural cliffs, which, lashed withwave-spray and their heads hidden in clouds, looked terriblythreatening and stern. Had our canoe been crushed or upset we couldhave made no landing here, for the cliffs, as high as those ofYosemite, sink sheer into deep water. Eagerly we scanned the wall onthe north side for the first sign of an opening fiord or harbor, all ofus anxious except Stickeen, who dozed in peace or gazed dreamily at thetremendous precipices when he heard us talking about them. At length wemade the joyful discovery of the mouth of the inlet now called â€œTaylorBay,â€ and about five oâ€™clock reached the head of it and encamped in aspruce grove near the front of a large glacier.While camp was being made, Joe the hunter climbed the mountain wall onthe east side of the fiord in pursuit of wild goats, while Mr. Youngand I went to the glacier. We found that it is separated from thewaters of the inlet by a tide-washed moraine, and extends, an abruptbarrier, all the way across from wall to wall of the inlet, a distanceof about three miles. But our most interesting discovery was that ithad recently advanced, though again slightly receding. A portion of theterminal moraine had been plowed up and shoved forward, uprooting andoverwhelming the woods on the east side. Many of the trees were downand buried, or nearly so, others were leaning away from the ice-cliffs,ready to fall, and some stood erect, with the bottom of the ice plowstill beneath their roots and its lofty crystal spires towering highabove their tops. The spectacle presented by these century-old treesstanding close beside a spiry wall of ice, with their branches almosttouching it, was most novel and striking. And when I climbed around thefront, and a little way up the west side of the glacier, I found thatit had swelled and increased in height and width in accordance with itsadvance, and carried away the outer ranks of trees on its bank.On our way back to camp after these first observations I planned afar-and-wide excursion for the morrow. I awoke early, called not onlyby the glacier, which had been on my mind all night, but by a grandflood-storm. The wind was blowing a gale from the north and the rainwas flying with the clouds in a wide passionate horizontal flood, as ifit were all passing over the country instead of falling on it. The mainperennial streams were booming high above their banks, and hundreds ofnew ones, roaring like the sea, almost covered the lofty gray walls ofthe inlet with white cascades and falls. I had intended making a cup ofcoffee and getting something like a breakfast before starting, but whenI heard the storm and looked out I made haste to join it; for many ofNatureâ€™s finest lessons are to be found in her storms, and if carefulto keep in right relations with them, we may go safely abroad withthem, rejoicing in the grandeur and beauty of their works and ways, andchanting with the old Norsemen, â€œThe blast of the tempest aids ouroars, the hurricane is our servant and drives us whither we wish togo.â€ So, omitting breakfast, I put a piece of bread in my pocket andhurried away.Mr. Young and the Indians were asleep, and so, I hoped, was Stickeen;but I had not gone a dozen rods before he left his bed in the tent andcame boring through the blast after me. That a man should welcomestorms for their exhilarating music and motion, and go forth to see Godmaking landscapes, is reasonable enough; but what fascination couldthere be in such tremendous weather for a dog? Surely nothing akin tohuman enthusiasm for scenery or geology. Anyhow, on he came,breakfastless, through the choking blast. I stopped and did my best toturn him back. â€œNow donâ€™t,â€ I said, shouting to make myself heard inthe storm, â€œnow donâ€™t, Stickeen. What has got into your queer noddlenow? You must be daft. This wild day has nothing for you. There is nogame abroad, nothing but weather. Go back to camp and keep warm, get agood breakfast with your master, and be sensible for once. I canâ€™tcarry you all day or feed you, and this storm will kill you.â€But Nature, it seems, was at the bottom of the affair, and she gainsher ends with dogs as well as with men, making us do as she likes,shoving and pulling us along her ways, however rough, all but killingus at times in getting her lessons driven hard home. After I hadstopped again and again, shouting good warning advice, I saw that hewas not to be shaken off; as well might the earth try to shake off themoon. I had once led his master into trouble, when he fell on one ofthe topmost jags of a mountain and dislocated his arm; now the turn ofhis humble companion was coming. The pitiful little wanderer just stoodthere in the wind, drenched and blinking, saying doggedly, â€œWhere thougoest I will go.â€ So at last I told him to come on if he must, and gavehim a piece of the bread I had in my pocket; then we struggled ontogether, and thus began the most memorable of all my wild days.The level flood, driving hard in our faces, thrashed and washed uswildly until we got into the shelter of a grove on the east side of theglacier near the front, where we stopped awhile for breath and tolisten and look out. The exploration of the glacier was my main object,but the wind was too high to allow excursions over its open surface,where one might be dangerously shoved while balancing for a jump on thebrink of a crevasse. In the mean time the storm was a fine study. Herethe end of the glacier, descending an abrupt swell of resisting rockabout five hundred feet high, leans forward and falls in ice cascades.And as the storm came down the glacier from the north, Stickeen and Iwere beneath the main current of the blast, while favorably located tosee and hear it. What a psalm the storm was singing, and how fresh thesmell of the washed earth and leaves, and how sweet the still smallvoices of the storm! Detached wafts and swirls were coming through thewoods, with music from the leaves and branches and furrowed boles, andeven from the splintered rocks and ice-crags overhead, many of thetones soft and low and flute-like, as if each leaf and tree, crag andspire were a tuned reed. A broad torrent, draining the side of theglacier, now swollen by scores of new streams from the mountains, wasrolling boulders along its rocky channel, with thudding, bumping,muffled sounds, rushing towards the bay with tremendous energy, as ifin haste to get out of the mountains; the waters above and beneathcalling to each other, and all to the ocean, their home.Looking southward from our shelter, we had this great torrent and theforested mountain wall above it on our left, the spiry ice-crags on ourright, and smooth gray gloom ahead. I tried to draw the marvelous scenein my note-book, but the rain blurred the page in spite of all my painsto shelter it, and the sketch was almost worthless. When the wind beganto abate, I traced the east side of the glacier. All the trees standingon the edge of the woods were barked and bruised, showing high-ice markin a very telling way, while tens of thousands of those that had stoodfor centuries on the bank of the glacier farther out lay crushed andbeing crushed. In many places I could see down fifty feet or so beneaththe margin of the glacier-mill, where trunks from one to two feet indiameter were being ground to pulp against outstanding rock-ribs andbosses of the bank.About three miles above the front of the glacier I climbed to thesurface of it by means of axe-steps made easy for Stickeen. As far asthe eye could reach, the level, or nearly level, glacier stretched awayindefinitely beneath the gray sky, a seemingly boundless prairie ofice. The rain continued, and grew colder, which I did not mind, but adim snowy look in the drooping clouds made me hesitate about venturingfar from land. No trace of the west shore was visible, and in case theclouds should settle and give snow, or the wind again become violent, Ifeared getting caught in a tangle of crevasses. Snow-crystals, theflowers of the mountain clouds, are frail, beautiful things, butterrible when flying on storm-winds in darkening, benumbing swarms orwhen welded together into glaciers full of deadly crevasses. Watchingthe weather, I sauntered about on the crystal sea. For a mile or twoout I found the ice remarkably safe. The marginal crevasses were mostlynarrow, while the few wider ones were easily avoided by passing aroundthem, and the clouds began to open here and there.Thus encouraged, I at last pushed out for the other side; for Naturecan make us do anything she likes. At first we made rapid progress, andthe sky was not very threatening, while I took bearings occasionallywith a pocket compass to enable me to find my way back more surely incase the storm should become blinding; but the structure lines of theglacier were my main guide. Toward the west side we came to a closelycrevassed section in which we had to make long, narrow tacks anddoublings, tracing the edges of tremendous transverse and longitudinalcrevasses, many of which were from twenty to thirty feet wide, andperhaps a thousand feet deepâ€”beautiful and awful. In working a waythrough them I was severely cautious, but Stickeen came on asunhesitating as the flying clouds. The widest crevasse that I couldjump he would leap without so much as halting to take a look at it. Theweather was now making quick changes, scattering bits of dazzlingbrightness through the wintry gloom; at rare intervals, when the sunbroke forth wholly free, the glacier was seen from shore to shore witha bright array of encompassing mountains partly revealed, wearing theclouds as garments, while the prairie bloomed and sparkled with irisedlight from myriads of washed crystals. Then suddenly all the gloriousshow would be darkened and blotted out.Stickeen seemed to care for none of these things, bright or dark, norfor the crevasses, wells, moulins, or swift flashing streams into whichhe might fall. The little adventurer was only about two years old, yetnothing seemed novel to him, nothing daunted him. He showed neithercaution nor curiosity, wonder nor fear, but bravely trotted on as ifglaciers were playgrounds. His stout, muffled body seemed all oneskipping muscle, and it was truly wonderful to see how swiftly and toall appearance heedlessly he flashed across nerve-trying chasms six oreight feet wide. His courage was so unwavering that it seemed to be dueto dullness of perception, as if he were only blindly bold; and I keptwarning him to be careful. For we had been close companions on so manywilderness trips that I had formed the habit of talking to him as if hewere a boy and understood every word.We gained the west shore in about three hours; the width of the glacierhere being about seven miles. Then I pushed northward in order to seeas far back as possible into the fountains of the FairweatherMountains, in case the clouds should rise. The walking was easy alongthe margin of the forest, which, of course, like that on the otherside, had been invaded and crushed by the swollen, overflowing glacier.In an hour or so, after passing a massive headland, we came suddenly ona branch of the glacier, which, in the form of a magnificentice-cascade two miles wide, was pouring over the rim of the main basinin a westerly direction, its surface broken into wave-shaped blades andshattered blocks, suggesting the wildest updashing, heaving, plungingmotion of a great river cataract. Tracing it down three or four miles,I found that it discharged into a lake, filling it with icebergs.I would gladly have followed the lake outlet to tide-water, but the daywas already far spent, and the threatening sky called for haste on thereturn trip to get off the ice before dark. I decided therefore to gono farther, and, after taking a general view of the wonderful region,turned back, hoping to see it again under more favorable auspices. Wemade good speed up the caÃ±on of the great ice-torrent, and out on themain glacier until we had left the west shore about two miles behindus. Here we got into a difficult network of crevasses, the gatheringclouds began to drop misty fringes, and soon the dreaded snow cameflying thick and fast. I now began to feel anxious about finding a wayin the blurring storm. Stickeen showed no trace of fear. He was stillthe same silent, able little hero. I noticed, however, that after thestorm-darkness came on he kept close up behind me. The snow urged us tomake still greater haste, but at the same time hid our way. I pushed onas best I could, jumping innumerable crevasses, and for every hundredrods or so of direct advance traveling a mile in doubling up and downin the turmoil of chasms and dislocated ice-blocks. After an hour ortwo of this work we came to a series of longitudinal crevasses ofappalling width, and almost straight and regular in trend, like immensefurrows. These I traced with firm nerve, excited and strengthened bythe danger, making wide jumps, poising cautiously on their dizzy edgesafter cutting hollows for my feet before making the spring, to avoidpossible slipping or any uncertainty on the farther sides, where onlyone trial is grantedâ€”exercise at once frightful and inspiring. Stickeenfollowed seemingly without effort.Many a mile we thus traveled, mostly up and down, making but littlereal headway in crossing, running instead of walking most of the timeas the danger of being compelled to spend the night on the glacierbecame threatening. Stickeen seemed able for anything. Doubtless wecould have weathered the storm for one night, dancing on a flat spot tokeep from freezing, and I faced the threat without feeling anythinglike despair; but we were hungry and wet, and the wind from themountains was still thick with snow and bitterly cold, so of coursethat night would have seemed a very long one. I could not see farenough through the blurring snow to judge in which general directionthe least dangerous route lay, while the few dim, momentary glimpses Icaught of mountains through rifts in the flying clouds were far fromencouraging either as weather signs or as guides. I had simply to gropemy way from crevasse to crevasse, holding a general direction by theice-structure, which was not to be seen everywhere, and partly by thewind. Again and again I was put to my mettle, but Stickeen followedeasily, his nerve apparently growing more unflinching as the dangerincreased. So it always is with mountaineers when hard beset. Runninghard and jumping, holding every minute of the remaining daylight, pooras it was, precious, we doggedly persevered and tried to hope thatevery difficult crevasse we overcame would prove to be the last of itskind. But on the contrary, as we advanced they became more deadlytrying.At length our way was barred by a very wide and straight crevasse,which I traced rapidly northward a mile or so without finding acrossing or hope of one; then down the glacier about as far, to whereit united with another uncrossable crevasse. In all this distance ofperhaps two miles there was only one place where I could possibly jumpit, but the width of this jump was the utmost I dared attempt, whilethe danger of slipping on the farther side was so great that I wasloath to try it. Furthermore, the side I was on was about a foot higherthan the other, and even with this advantage the crevasse seemeddangerously wide. One is liable to underestimate the width of crevasseswhere the magnitudes in general are great, I therefore stared at thisone mighty keenly, estimating its width and the shape of the edge onthe farther side, until I thought that I could jump it if necessary,but that in case I should be compelled to jump back from the lower sideI might fail. Now, a cautious mountaineer seldom takes a step onunknown ground which seems at all dangerous that he cannot retrace incase he should be stopped by unseen obstacles ahead. This is the ruleof mountaineers who live long, and, though in haste, I compelled myselfto sit down and calmly deliberate before I broke it.Retracing my devious path in imagination as if it were drawn on achart, I saw that I was recrossing the glacier a mile or two farther upstream than the course pursued in the morning, and that I was nowentangled in a section I had not before seen. Should I risk thisdangerous jump, or try to regain the woods on the west shore, make afire, and have only hunger to endure while waiting for a new day? I hadalready crossed so broad a stretch of dangerous ice that I saw it wouldbe difficult to get back to the woods through the storm, before dark,and the attempt would most likely result in a dismal night-dance on theglacier; while just beyond the present barrier the surface seemed morepromising, and the east shore was now perhaps about as near as thewest. I was therefore eager to go on. But this wide jump was a dreadfulobstacle.At length, because of the dangers already behind me, I determined toventure against those that might be ahead, jumped and landed well, butwith so little to spare that I more than ever dreaded being compelledto take that jump back from the lower side. Stickeen followed, makingnothing of it, and we ran eagerly forward, hoping we were leaving allour troubles behind. But within the distance of a few hundred yards wewere stopped by the widest crevasse yet encountered. Of course I madehaste to explore it, hoping all might yet be remedied by finding abridge or a way around either end. About three-fourths of a mileupstream I found that it united with the one we had just crossed, as Ifeared it would. Then, tracing it down, I found it joined the samecrevasse at the lower end also, maintaining throughout its whole coursea width of forty to fifty feet. Thus to my dismay I discovered that wewere on a narrow island about two miles long, with two barely possibleways of escape: one back by the way we came, the other ahead by analmost inaccessible sliver-bridge that crossed the great crevasse fromnear the middle of it!After this nerve-trying discovery I ran back to the sliver-bridge andcautiously examined it. Crevasses, caused by strains from variations inthe rate of motion of different parts of the glacier and convexities inthe channel, are mere cracks when they first open, so narrow as hardlyto admit the blade of a pocket-knife, and gradually widen according tothe extent of the strain and the depth of the glacier. Now some ofthese cracks are interrupted, like the cracks in wood, and in opening,the strip of ice between overlapping ends is dragged out, and maymaintain a continuous connection between the sides, just as the twosides of a slivered crack in wood that is being split are connected.Some crevasses remain open for months or even years, and by the meltingof their sides continue to increase in width long after the openingstrain has ceased; while the sliver-bridges, level on top at first andperfectly safe, are at length melted to thin, vertical, knife-edgedblades, the upper portion being most exposed to the weather; and sincethe exposure is greatest in the middle, they at length curve downwardlike the cables of suspension bridges. This one was evidently very old,for it had been weathered and wasted until it was the most dangerousand inaccessible that ever lay in my way. The width of the crevasse washere about fifty feet, and the sliver crossing diagonally was aboutseventy feet long; its thin knife-edge near the middle was depressedtwenty-five or thirty feet below the level of the glacier, and theupcurving ends were attached to the sides eight or ten feet below thebrink. Getting down the nearly vertical wall to the end of the sliverand up the other side were the main difficulties, and they seemed allbut insurmountable. Of the many perils encountered in my years ofwandering on mountains and glaciers none seemed so plain and stern andmerciless as this. And it was presented when we were wet to the skinand hungry, the sky dark with quick driving snow, and the night near.But we were forced to face it. It was a tremendous necessity.Beginning, not immediately above the sunken end of the bridge, but alittle to one side, I cut a deep hollow on the brink for my knees torest in. Then, leaning over, with my short-handled axe I cut a stepsixteen or eighteen inches below, which on account of the sheerness ofthe wall was necessarily shallow. That step, however, was well made;its floor sloped slightly inward and formed a good hold for my heels.Then, slipping cautiously upon it, and crouching as low as possible,with my left side toward the wall, I steadied myself against the windwith my left hand in a slight notch, while with the right I cut othersimilar steps and notches in succession, guarding against losingbalance by glinting of the axe, or by wind-gusts, for life and deathwere in every stroke and in the niceness of finish of every foothold.After the end of the bridge was reached I chipped it down until I hadmade a level platform six or eight inches wide, and it was a tryingthing to poise on this little slippery platform while bending over toget safely astride of the sliver. Crossing was then comparatively easyby chipping off the sharp edge with short, careful strokes, andhitching forward an inch or two at a time, keeping my balance with myknees pressed against the sides. The tremendous abyss on either hand Istudiously ignored. To me the edge of that blue sliver was then all theworld. But the most trying part of the adventure, after working my wayacross inch by inch and chipping another small platform, was to risefrom the safe position astride and to cut a step-ladder in the nearlyvertical face of the wall,â€”chipping, climbing, holding on with feet andfingers in mere notches. At such times oneâ€™s whole body is eye, andcommon skill and fortitude are replaced by power beyond our call orknowledge. Never before had I been so long under deadly strain. How Igot up that cliff I never could tell. The thing seemed to have beendone by somebody else. I never have held death in contempt, though inthe course of my explorations I have oftentimes felt that to meet oneâ€™sfate on a noble mountain, or in the heart of a glacier, would beblessed as compared with death from disease, or from some shabbylowland accident. But the best death, quick and crystal-pure, set soglaringly open before us, is hard enough to face, even though we feelgratefully sure that we have already had happiness enough for a dozenlives.But poor Stickeen, the wee, hairy, sleekit beastie, think of him! WhenI had decided to dare the bridge, and while I was on my knees chippinga hollow on the rounded brow above it, he came behind me, pushed hishead past my shoulder, looked down and across, scanned the sliver andits approaches with his mysterious eyes, then looked me in the facewith a startled air of surprise and concern, and began to mutter andwhine; saying as plainly as if speaking with words, â€œSurely, you arenot going into that awful place.â€ This was the first time I had seenhim gaze deliberately into a crevasse, or into my face with an eager,speaking, troubled look. That he should have recognized and appreciatedthe danger at the first glance showed wonderful sagacity. Never beforehad the daring midget seemed to know that ice was slippery or thatthere was any such thing as danger anywhere. His looks and tones ofvoice when he began to complain and speak his fears were so human thatI unconsciously talked to him in sympathy as I would to a frightenedboy, and in trying to calm his fears perhaps in some measure moderatedmy own. â€œHush your fears, my boy,â€ I said, â€œwe will get across safe,though it is not going to be easy. No right way is easy in this roughworld. We must risk our lives to save them. At the worst we can onlyslip, and then how grand a grave we will have, and by and by our nicebones will do good in the terminal moraine.â€But my sermon was far from reassuring him: he began to cry, and aftertaking another piercing look at the tremendous gulf, ran away indesperate excitement, seeking some other crossing. By the time he gotback, baffled of course, I had made a step or two. I dared not lookback, but he made himself heard; and when he saw that I was certainlybent on crossing he cried aloud in despair. The danger was enough todaunt anybody, but it seems wonderful that he should have been able toweigh and appreciate it so justly. No mountaineer could have seen itmore quickly or judged it more wisely, discriminating between real andapparent peril.When I gained the other side, he screamed louder than ever, and afterrunning back and forth in vain search for a way of escape, he wouldreturn to the brink of the crevasse above the bridge, moaning andwailing as if in the bitterness of death. Could this be the silent,philosophic Stickeen? I shouted encouragement, telling him the bridgewas not so bad as it looked, that I had left it flat and safe for hisfeet, and he could walk it easily. But he was afraid to try. Strange sosmall an animal should be capable of such big, wise fears. I calledagain and again in a reassuring tone to come on and fear nothing; thathe could come if he would only try. He would hush for a moment, lookdown again at the bridge, and shout his unshakable conviction that hecould never, never come that way; then lie back in despair, as ifhowling, â€œO-o-oh! what a place! No-o-o, I can never go-o-o down there!â€His natural composure and courage had vanished utterly in a tumultuousstorm of fear. Had the danger been less, his distress would have seemedridiculous. But in this dismal, merciless abyss lay the shadow ofdeath, and his heartrending cries might well have called Heaven to hishelp. Perhaps they did. So hidden before, he was now transparent, andone could see the workings of his heart and mind like the movements ofa clock out of its case. His voice and gestures, hopes and fears, wereso perfectly human that none could mistake them; while he seemed tounderstand every word of mine. I was troubled at the thought of havingto leave him out all night, and of the danger of not finding him in themorning. It seemed impossible to get him to venture. To compel him totry through fear of being abandoned, I started off as if leaving him tohis fate, and disappeared back of a hummock; but this did no good; heonly lay down and moaned in utter hopeless misery. So, after hiding afew minutes, I went back to the brink of the crevasse and in a severetone of voice shouted across to him that now I must certainly leavehim, I could wait no longer, and that, if he would not come, all Icould promise was that I would return to seek him next day. I warnedhim that if he went back to the woods the wolves would kill him, andfinished by urging him once more by words and gestures to come on, comeon.He knew very well what I meant, and at last, with the courage ofdespair, hushed and breathless, he crouched down on the brink in thehollow I had made for my knees, pressed his body against the ice as iftrying to get the advantage of the friction of every hair, gazed intothe first step, put his little feet together and slid them slowly,slowly over the edge and down into it, bunching all four in it andalmost standing on his head. Then, without lifting his feet, as well asI could see through the snow, he slowly worked them over the edge ofthe step and down into the next and the next in succession in the sameway, and gained the end of the bridge. Then, lifting his feet with theregularity and slowness of the vibrations of a seconds pendulum, as ifcounting and measuring one-two-three, holding himself steady againstthe gusty wind, and giving separate attention to each little step, hegained the foot of the cliff, while I was on my knees leaning over togive him a lift should he succeed in getting within reach of my arm.Here he halted in dead silence, and it was here I feared he might fail,for dogs are poor climbers. I had no cord. If I had had one, I wouldhave dropped a noose over his head and hauled him up. But while I wasthinking whether an available cord might be made out of clothing, hewas looking keenly into the series of notched steps and finger-holds Ihad made, as if counting them, and fixing the position of each one ofthem in his mind. Then suddenly up he came in a springy rush, hookinghis paws into the steps and notches so quickly that I could not see howit was done, and whizzed past my head, safe at last!And now came a scene! â€œWell done, well done, little boy! Brave boy!â€ Icried, trying to catch and caress him; but he would not be caught.Never before or since have I seen anything like so passionate arevulsion from the depths of despair to exultant, triumphant,uncontrollable joy. He flashed and darted hither and thither as iffairly demented, screaming and shouting, swirling round and round ingiddy loops and circles like a leaf in a whirlwind, lying down, androlling over and over, sidewise and heels over head, and pouring fortha tumultuous flood of hysterical cries and sobs and gasping mutterings.When I ran up to him to shake him, fearing he might die of joy, heflashed off two or three hundred yards, his feet in a mist of motion;then, turning suddenly, came back in a wild rush and launched himselfat my face, almost knocking me down, all the time screeching andscreaming and shouting as if saying, â€œSaved! saved! saved!â€ Then awayagain, dropping suddenly at times with his feet in the air, tremblingand fairly sobbing. Such passionate emotion was enough to kill him.Mosesâ€™ stately song of triumph after escaping the Egyptians and the RedSea was nothing to it. Who could have guessed the capacity of the dull,enduring little fellow for all that most stirs this mortal frame?Nobody could have helped crying with him!But there is nothing like work for toning down excessive fear or joy.So I ran ahead, calling him in as gruff a voice as I could command tocome on and stop his nonsense, for we had far to go and it would soonbe dark. Neither of us feared another trial like this. Heaven wouldsurely count one enough for a lifetime. The ice ahead was gashed bythousands of crevasses, but they were common ones. The joy ofdeliverance burned in us like fire, and we ran without fatigue, everymuscle with immense rebound glorying in its strength. Stickeen flewacross everything in his way, and not till dark did he settle into hisnormal fox-like trot. At last the cloudy mountains came in sight, andwe soon felt the solid rock beneath our feet, and were safe. Then cameweakness. Danger had vanished, and so had our strength. We tottereddown the lateral moraine in the dark, over boulders and tree trunks,through the bushes and devil-club thickets of the grove where we hadsheltered ourselves in the morning, and across the level mud-slope ofthe terminal moraine. We reached camp about ten oâ€™clock, and found abig fire and a big supper. A party of Hoona Indians had visited Mr.Young, bringing a gift of porpoise meat and wild strawberries, andHunter Joe had brought in a wild goat. But we lay down, too tired toeat much, and soon fell into a troubled sleep. The man who said, â€œTheharder the toil, the sweeter the rest,â€ never was profoundly tired.Stickeen kept springing up and muttering in his sleep, no doubtdreaming that he was still on the brink of the crevasse; and so did I,that night and many others long afterward, when I was overtired.Thereafter Stickeen was a changed dog. During the rest of the trip,instead of holding aloof, he always lay by my side, tried to keep meconstantly in sight, and would hardly accept a morsel of food, howevertempting, from any hand but mine. At night, when all was quiet aboutthe camp-fire, he would come to me and rest his head on my knee with alook of devotion as if I were his god. And often as he caught my eye heseemed to be trying to say, â€œWasnâ€™t that an awful time we had togetheron the glacier?â€Nothing in after years has dimmed that Alaska storm-day. As I write itall comes rushing and roaring to mind as if I were again in the heartof it. Again I see the gray flying clouds with their rain-floods andsnow, the ice-cliffs towering above the shrinking forest, the majesticice-cascade, the vast glacier outspread before its white mountainfountains, and in the heart of it the tremendous crevasse,â€”emblem ofthe valley of the shadow of death,â€”low clouds trailing over it, thesnow falling into it; and on its brink I see little Stickeen, and Ihear his cries for help and his shouts of joy. I have known many dogs,and many a story I could tell of their wisdom and devotion; but to nonedo I owe so much as to Stickeen. At first the least promising and leastknown of my dog-friends, he suddenly became the best known of them all.Our storm-battle for life brought him to light, and through him asthrough a window I have ever since been looking with deeper sympathyinto all my fellow mortals.None of Stickeenâ€™s friends knows what finally became of him. After mywork for the season was done I departed for California, and I never sawthe dear little fellow again. In reply to anxious inquiries his masterwrote me that in the summer of 1883 he was stolen by a tourist at FortWrangel and taken away on a steamer. His fate is wrapped in mystery.Doubtless he has left this worldâ€”crossed the last crevasseâ€”and gone toanother. But he will not be forgotten. To me Stickeen is immortal.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Stickeen, by John Muir*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TEN THOUSAND MILES WITH A DOG SLED ***Produced by Suzanne Lybarger, Brian Janes, OnlineDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net andthe booksmiths at http://www.eBookForge.netTEN THOUSAND MILES WITH A DOG SLEDBY THE SAME AUTHORTHE ASCENT OF DENALI (MT.

The title might haveclaimed fourteen or fifteen thousand miles instead of ten, for the bookwas projected and the title adopted some years ago, and the journeyshave continued. But ten thousand is a good round titular number, and isnone the worse for being well within the mark.So far as mere distance is concerned, anyway, there is nothingnoteworthy in this record. There are many men in Alaska who have donemuch more. A mail-carrier on one of the longer dog routes will coverfour thousand miles in a winter, while the writer's average is less thantwo thousand. But his sled has gone far off the beaten track, across thearctic wilderness, into many remote corners; wherever, indeed, white menor natives were to be found in all the great interior.These journeys were connected primarily with the administration of theextensive work of the Episcopal Church in the interior of Alaska, underthe bishop of the diocese; but that feature of them has been fully setforth from time to time in the church publications, and finds onlyincidental reference here.It is a great, wild country, little known save along accustomed routesof travel; a country with a beauty and a fascination all its own; merearctic wilderness, indeed, and nine tenths of it probably destinedalways to remain such, yet full of interest and charm.Common opinion "outside" about Alaska seems to be veering from the viewthat it is a land of perpetual snow and ice to the other extreme ofholding it to be a "world's treasure-house" of mineral wealth andagricultural possibility. The world's treasure is deposited in manyhouses, and Alaska has its share; its mineral wealth is very great, and"hidden doors of opulence" may open at any time, but its agriculturalpossibilities, in the ordinary sense in which the phrase is used, areconfined to very small areas in proportion to the enormous whole, and invery limited degree.It is no new thing for those who would build railways to write inhigh-flown style about the regions they would penetrate, and, indeed, tospeak of "millions of acres waiting for the plough" is not necessarily amisrepresentation; they are waiting. Nor is it altogether unnatural thatprofessional agricultural experimenters at the stations established bythe government should make the most of their experiments. When DeanStanley spoke disdainfully of dogma, Lord Beaconsfield replied; "Ah! butyou must always remember, no dogmas, no deans."Besides the physical attractions of this country, it has a gentleaboriginal population that arouses in many ways the respect and thesympathy of all kindly people; and it has some of the hardiest and mostadventurous white men in the world. The reader will come into contactwith both in these pages.So much for the book's scope; a word of its limitations. It is confinedto the interior of Alaska; confined in the main to the great valley ofthe Yukon and its tributaries; being a record of sled journeys, it isconfined to the winter.There is no man living who knows the whole of Alaska or who has anyright to speak about the whole of Alaska. Bishop Rowe knows more aboutAlaska, in all probability, than any other living man, and there arelarge areas of the country in which he has never set foot. There isprobably no man living, save Bishop Rowe, who has visited even thelocalities of all the missions of the Episcopal Church in Alaska. If onewere to travel continuously for a whole year, using the most expeditiousmeans at his command, and not wasting a day anywhere, it is doubtfulwhether, summer and winter, by sea and land, squeezing the last mile outof the seasons, travelling on the "last ice" and the "first water," hecould even touch at all the mission stations. So, when a man from Nomespeaks of Alaska he means his part of Alaska, the Seward Peninsula. Whena man from Valdez or Cordova speaks of Alaska he means the PrinceWilliam Sound country. When a man from Juneau speaks of Alaska he meansthe southeastern coast. Alaska is not one country but many, withdifferent climates, different resources, different problems, differentpopulations, different interests; and what is true of one part of it isoften grotesquely untrue of other parts. This is the reason why so manycontradictory things have been written about the country. Not only dothese various parts of Alaska differ radically from one another, butthey are separated from one another by almost insuperable naturalobstacles, so that they are in reality different countries.When Alaska is spoken of in this book the interior is meant, in whichthe writer has travelled almost continuously for the past eight years.The Seward Peninsula is the only other part of the country that the booktouches. And as regards summer travel and the summer aspect of thecountry, there is material for another book should the reception of thisone warrant its preparation.       *       *       *       *       *The problems of the civil government of the country will be foundtouched upon somewhat freely as they rise from time to time in thecourse of these journeys, and some faint hope is entertained thatdrawing attention to evils may hasten a remedy.Alaska is not now, and never has been, a lawless country in the old,Wild Western sense of unpunished homicides and crimes of violence. Ithas been, on the whole, singularly free from bloodshed--a record due inno small part to the fact that it is not the custom of the country tocarry pistols, for which again there is climatic and geographic reason;due also in part to the very peaceable and even timid character of itsnative people.But as regards the stringent laws enacted by Congress for the protectionof these native people, and especially in the essential particular ofprotecting them from the fatal effects of intoxicating liquor, thecountry is not law-abiding, for these laws are virtually a dead letter.Justices of the peace who must live wholly upon fees in regions wherefees will not furnish a living, and United States deputy marshalsappointed for political reasons, constitute a very feeble staff againstlaw-breakers. When it is remembered that on the whole fifteen hundredmiles of the American Yukon there are but six of these deputy marshals,and that these six men, with another five or six on the tributaryrivers, form all the police of the country, it will be seen thatCongress must do something more than pass stringent laws if those lawsare to be of any effect.A body of stipendiary magistrates, a police force wholly removed frompolitics and modelled somewhat upon the Canadian Northwest MountedPolice--these are two of the great needs of the country if the liquorlaws are to be enforced and the native people are to survive.That the danger of the extermination of the natives is a real one allvital statistics kept at Yukon River points in the last five years show,and that there are powerful influences in the country opposed to theexecution of the liquor laws some recent trials at Fairbanks would leaveno room for doubt if there had been any room before. Indeed, at thiswriting, when the pages of this book are closed and there remains noplace save the preface where the matter can be referred to, an impudentattempt is on foot, with large commercial backing, to secure theremoval of a zealous and fearless United States district attorney, whohas been too active in prosecuting liquor-peddlers to suit the wholesaledealers in liquor.There are, of course, those who view with perfect equanimity thedestruction of the natives that is now going on, and look forward withcomplacency to the time when the Alaskan Indian shall have ceased toexist. But to men of thought and feeling such cynicism is abhorrent, andthe duty of the government towards its simple and kindly wards is clear.A measure of real protection must be given the native communitiesagainst the low-down whites who seek to intrude into them and buildhabitations for convenient resort upon occasions of drunkenness anddebauchery, and some adequate machinery set up for suppressing thecontemptible traffic in adulterated spirits they subsist largely upon.The licensed liquor-dealers do not themselves sell to Indians, but theynotoriously sell to men who notoriously peddle to Indians, and thesuppression of this illicit commerce would materially reduce the totalsales of liquor.Some measure of protection, one thinks, must also be afforded against apredatory class of Indian traders, the back rooms of whose stores areoften barrooms, gambling-dens, and houses of assignation, andheadquarters and harbourage for the white degenerates--even if thegovernment go the length of setting up co-operative Indian stores in theinterior, as has been done in some places on the coast. This last is amatter in which the missions are helpless, for there is no wisecombination of religion and trade.So this book goes forth with a plea in the front of it, which will findincidental support and expression throughout it, for the natives ofinterior Alaska, that they be not wantonly destroyed off the face of theearth.        HUDSON STUCK.        NEW YORK,        _March, 1914._PREFACE TO SECOND EDITIONIT is gratifying to know that a second edition of this book has beencalled for and it is interesting to write another preface; it evenproved interesting to do what was set about most reluctantly--thereading of the book over again after entire avoidance of it for twoyears. It was necessary to do it, though one shrank from it, and it isinteresting to know that after this comparatively long and completedetachment I find little to add and less to correct. Upon a completerereading I am content to let the book stand, with two or threefootnotes thrown in, and the correction of the one printer's error itcontained from cover to cover--an error that a score of kindcorrespondents pointed out, for it was conspicuous in the title of apicture.The tendency to which attention is drawn in the original preface, thependulum swing from the old notion that Alaska is a land of polar bearsand icebergs to the new notion that it is a "world's treasure-house ofmineral wealth and unbounded agricultural possibilities" is yet moremarked than it was two years ago. The beginning of the building of thegovernment railway has given new impetus to the "boosting" writers formagazines and newspapers. Quite recently it was stated in one suchpublication that we need not worry about the destruction of ourforests, for had we not the inexhaustible timber resources of theinterior of Alaska to draw upon?And in the North itself--though no one there would write about thetimber resources of the interior--in certain shrill journals the man whodoes not confidently expect to see the Yukon Flats waving with goldengrain and "the lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea" of the Koyukuk andthe Chandalar is regarded as a traitor to his country and his God. Butit must be remembered that there are a number of journalists in Alaskawho know nothing of the country outside their respective towns, and that"boosting" grows shriller, as Eugene Field found red paint grow redder,"the further out West one goes." When they get a newspaper at CapePrince of Wales what a clarion it will be!Truth, however, is not more wont than of old to be found in extremes,and the author of this book believes that those who desire a sober viewof the country it deals with will find it herein. He claims no more thanthat he has had adequate opportunity of forming his opinions and that hehas a right to their expression. It is now twelve years since he beganalmost constant travelling, winter and summer, in the interior ofAlaska. He has described nothing that he has not seen; ventured nojudgment that he has not well digested, and has nothing to retract oreven modify; but he would repeat and emphasise a caution of the originalpreface. Alaska is not one country but many countries, and so widely dothey differ from one another in almost every respect that no generalstatements about Alaska can be true. The present author's knowledge ofthe territory is confined in the main to the interior--to the valley ofthe Yukon and its tributary rivers, which make up one of the world'sgreat waterways--and nothing of his writing applies, with his authority,to other parts.The matter of the preservation of the native peoples still presses, andis nearer to the author's heart than any other matter whatever. TheUnited States Congress, which voted thirty-five millions of dollars forthe government railroad, strikes out year by year the modest additionalscore or two of thousands that year by year the Bureau of Education asksfor the establishment of hospital work amongst the Indians of theinterior, and the preventable mortality continues to be very great.In the last two years, largely as the result of the untiring efforts ofBishop Rowe on behalf of the natives, two modern, well-equippedhospitals have been built, with money that he and his clergy havegathered, on the Yukon River, one at Fort Yukon and one at Tanana; andthese are the only places of any kind, on nearly a thousand miles of theriver, where sick or injured Indians may be received and cared for.Amongst men of thought and feeling there is noticeable revulsion fromthe supercilious attitude that used not to be uncommon toward the littlepeoples of the world. It begins to be recognised that it is quitepossible that even the smallest of the little peoples may have somecontribution to make to the welfare and progress of the human race. Whatis the Boy Scout movement that is sweeping the country, to the enormousbenefit of the rising generation, but the incorporating into the nurtureof our youth of the things that were the nurture of the Indian youth;that are a large part of the nurture of the Alaskan Indian youth to-day?And the camp-fire clubs and woodcraft associations and the whole trendto the life of the open recognise that the Indian had developed atechnique of wilderness life deserving of preservation for its value tothe white man. While as for the Esquimaux, the author never sees theextraordinary prevalence amongst them of the art of graphic delineationdisplayed in bold etchings of incidents of the chase upon theirimplements and weapons (though not upon the articles made by the dozenfor the curio-venders at Nome and Saint Michael) without dreaming thatsome day an artist will come from out that singular and most interestingpeople who shall teach the world something new about art.Whatever the future may hold for the interior of Alaska, the author isconvinced that its population will derive very largely from the presentnative stocks, and this alone would justify any efforts to preventfurther inroads upon their health and vitality.

"Sweeping in a great arcover sixteen degrees of latitude and fifty-eight degrees of longitude,"it is no less than four, and some might say five, different countries,differing from one another in almost every way that one country candiffer from another: in climate, in population, in resources, inrequirements; and--(3) These different countries are not merely different from one another,they are _separated_ from one another by formidable natural barriers.TEN THOUSAND MILES WITH A DOG SLEDCHAPTER IFAIRBANKS TO THE CHANDALAR THROUGH CIRCLE CITY AND FORT YUKONTHE plan for the winter journey of 1905-6 (my second winter on thetrail) was an ambitious one, for it contemplated a visit to Point Hope,on the shore of the Arctic Ocean between Kotzebue Sound and PointBarrow, and a return to Fairbanks. In the summer such a journey would bepracticable only by water: down the Tanana to the Yukon, down the Yukonto its mouth, and then through the straits of Bering and along theArctic coast; in the winter it is possible to make the journey acrosscountry. A desire to visit our most northerly and most inaccessiblemission in Alaska and a desire to become acquainted with generalconditions in the wide country north of the Yukon were equal factors inthe planning of a journey which would carry me through three and a halfdegrees of latitude and no less than eighteen degrees of longitude.The course of winter travel in Alaska follows the frozen waterways sofar as they lead in the general direction desired, leaves them to crossmountain ranges and divides at the most favourable points, and dropsdown into the streams again so soon as streams are available. Thecountry is notably well watered and the waterways are the naturalhighways. The more frequented routes gradually cut out the serpentinebends of the rivers by land trails, but in the wilder parts of thecountry travel sticks to the ice.Our course, therefore, lay up the Chatanika River and one of itstributaries until the Tanana-Yukon watershed was reached; then throughthe mountains, crossing two steep summits to the Yukon slope, and downthat slope by convenient streams to the Yukon River at Circle City.[Sidenote: THE GOLD TRAIN]We set out on the 27th of November with six dogs and a "basket" sled andabout five hundred pounds' weight of load, including tent and stove,bedding, clothes for the winter, grub box and its equipment, and dogfeed. The dogs were those that I had used the previous winter, with oneexception. The leader had come home lame from the fish camp where he hadbeen boarded during the summer, and, despite all attentions, thelameness had persisted; so he must be left behind, and there was muchdifficulty in securing another leader. A recent stampede to a new miningdistrict had advanced the price of dogs and gathered up all the goodones, so it was necessary to hunt all over Fairbanks and pay a hundreddollars for a dog that proved very indifferent, after all. "Jimmy" was ahandsome beast, the handsomest I ever owned and the costliest, but, as Ilearned later from one who knew his history, had "travelled on hislooks all his life." He earned the name of "Jimmy the Fake."Midway to Cleary "City," on the chief gold-producing creek of thedistrict, our first day's run, we encountered the gold train. For sometime previous a lone highwayman had robbed solitary miners on their wayto Fairbanks with gold-dust, and now a posse was organised that went therounds of the creeks and gathered up the dust and bore it on mule-backto the bank, escorted by half a dozen armed and mounted men. Sawed-offshotguns were the favourite weapons, and one judged them deadly enoughat short range. The heavy "pokes" galled the animals' backs, howeverthey might be slung, and the little procession wound slowly along, a manahead, a man behind, and four clustered round the treasure.These raw, temporary mining towns are much alike the world over, onesupposes, though perhaps a little worse up here in the far north. It waslate at night when we reached the place, but saloon and dance-hall wereablaze with light and loud with the raucity of phonographs and thestamping of feet. Everything was "wide open," and there was not even thethinnest veneer of respectability. Drinking and gambling and dancing goon all night long. Drunken men reel out upon the snow; painted facesleer over muslin curtains as one passes by. Without any government,without any pretence of municipal organisation, there is no co-operationfor public enterprise. There are no streets, there are no sidewalkssave such as a man may choose to lay in front of his own premises, andthe simplest sanitary precautions are entirely neglected. Nothing butthe cold climate of the north prevents epidemic disease from sweepingthrough these places. They rise in a few days wherever gold is found inquantities, they flourish as the production increases, decline with itsdecline, and are left gaunt, dark, and abandoned so soon as the diggingsare exhausted.The next day we were on the Chatanika River, to which Cleary Creek istributary, and were immediately confronted with one of the main troublesand difficulties of winter travel in this and, as may be supposed, inany arctic or subarctic country--overflow water.[Sidenote: OVERFLOW WATER AND ICE]In the lesser rivers, where deep pools alternate with swift shallows,the stream freezes solid to the bottom upon the shoals and riffles.Since the subterranean fountains that supply the river do not cease todischarge their waters in the winter, however cold it may be, therecomes presently an increasing pressure under the ice above such abarrier. The pent-up water is strong enough to heave the ice into moundsand at last to break forth, spreading itself far along the frozensurface of the river. At times it may be seen gushing out like anartesian well, rising three or four feet above the surface of the ice,until the pressure is relieved. Sometimes for many miles at a stretchthe whole river will be covered with a succession of such overflows,from two or three inches deep to eight or ten, or even twelve; some justbursting forth, some partially frozen, some resolved into solid "glare"ice. Thus the surface of the river is continually renewed the wholewinter through, and a section of the ice crust in the spring would showa series of laminations; here ice upon ice, there ice uponhalf-incorporated snow, that mark the successive inundations.This explanation has been given at length because of the large part thatthe phenomenon plays in the difficulty and danger of winter travel, andbecause it seems hard to make those who are not familiar with itunderstand it. At first sight it would seem that after a week or tendays of fifty-below-zero weather, for instance, all water everywherewould be frozen into quiescence for the rest of the winter. Throw abucket of water into the air, and it is frozen solid as soon as itreaches the ground. There would be no more trouble, one would think,with water. Yet some of the worst trouble the traveller has withoverflow water is during very cold weather, and it is then, of course,that there is the greatest danger of frost-bite in getting one's feetwet. Water-proof footwear, therefore, becomes one of the "musher's"great concerns and difficulties. The best water-proof footwear is theEsquimau mukluk, not easily obtainable in the interior of Alaska, butthe mukluk is an inconvenient footwear to put snow-shoes on. Rubberboots or shoes of any kind are most uncomfortable things to travel in.Nothing equals the moccasin on the trail, nothing is so good tosnow-shoe in. The well-equipped traveller has moccasins for dry trailsand mukluks for wet trails--and even then may sometimes get his feetwet. Nor are his own feet his only consideration; his dogs' feet are,collectively, as important as his own. When the dog comes out of waterinto snow again the snow collects and freezes between the toes, and ifnot removed will soon cause a sore and lameness. Then a dog moccasinmust be put on and the foot continually nursed and doctored. Whenseveral dogs of a team are thus affected, it may be with several feeteach, the labour and trouble of travel are greatly increased.So, whenever his dogs have been through water, the careful musher willstop and go all down the line, cleaning out the ice and snow from theirfeet with his fingers. Four interdigital spaces per foot make sixteenper dog, and with a team of six dogs that means ninety-six severaloperations with the bare hand (if it be done effectually) every time theteam gets into an overflow. The dogs will do it for themselves if theyare given time, tearing out the lumps of ice with their teeth; but,inasmuch as they usually feel conscientiously obliged to eat each lumpas they pull it out, it takes much longer, and in a short daylight thereis little time to spare if the day's march is to be made.[Sidenote: "OVERFLOW" ICE]We found overflow almost as soon as we reached the Chatanika River, andin one form or another we encountered it during all the two days and ahalf that we were pursuing the river's windings. At times it was coveredwith a sheet of new ice that would support the dogs but would notsupport the sled, so that the dogs were travelling on one level and thesled on another, and a man had to walk along in the water between thedogs and the sled for several hundred yards at a time, breaking down theoverflow ice with his feet.At other times the thin sheets of overflow ice would sway and bend asthe sled passed quickly over them in a way that gives to ice in suchcondition its Alaskan name of "rubber-ice," while for the fifteen ortwenty miles of McManus Creek, the headwaters of the Chatanika, we hadcontinuous stretches of fine glare ice with enough frost crystals uponit from condensing moisture to give a "tooth" to the dogs' feet, just asvarnish on a photographic negative gives tooth to the retouching pencil.Perfectly smooth ice is a very difficult surface for dogs to pass over;glare ice slightly roughened by frost deposit makes splendid, fastgoing.Eighty-five miles or so from Fairbanks, and just about half-way toCircle, the watercourse is left and the first summit is the"Twelve-Mile," as it is called. We tried hard to take our load up at onetrip, but found it impossible to do so, and had to unlash the sled andtake half the load at a time, caching it on the top while we returnedfor the other half.It took us half a day to get our load to the top of the Twelve-Milesummit, a rise of about one thousand three hundred feet from the creekbed as the aneroid gave it. In the steeper pitches we had to take theaxe and cut steps, so hard and smooth does the incessant wind at theseheights beat the snow, and on our second trip to the top we were just intime to rescue a roll of bedding that had been blown from the cache andwas about to descend a gully from which we could hardly have recoveredit.This summit descended, we were in Birch Creek water, and had we followedthe watercourse would have reached the Yukon; but we would havetravelled hundreds of miles and would have come out below Fort Yukon,while we were bound for Circle City. So there was another and a yet moredifficult summit to cross before we could descend the Yukon slope. Wewere able to hire a man and two dogs to help us over the Eagle summit,so that the necessity of relaying was avoided. One man ahead continuallycalling to the dogs, eight dogs steadily pulling, and two men behindsteadily pushing, foot by foot, with many stoppages as one bench afteranother was surmounted, we got the load to the top at last, a rise ofone thousand four hundred feet in less than three miles. A drivingsnow-storm cut off all view and would have left us at a loss which wayto proceed but for the stakes that indicated it.The descent was as anxious and hazardous as the ascent had beenlaborious. The dogs were loosed and sent racing down the slope. With arope rough-lock around the sled runners, one man took the gee pole andanother the handle-bars and each spread-eagled himself through the loosedeep snow to check the momentum of the sled, until sled and men turnedaside and came to a stop in a drift to avoid a steep, smooth pitch. Thesled extricated, it was poised on the edge of the pitch and turned looseon the hardened snow, hurtling down three or four hundred feet until itburied itself in another drift. The dogs were necessary to drag it fromthis drift, and one had to go down and bring them up. Then again theywere loosed, and from bench to bench the process was repeated until theslope grew gentle enough to permit the regulation of the downwardprogress by the foot-brake.[Sidenote: "SUMMITS"]The Eagle summit is one of the most difficult summits in Alaska. Thewind blows so fiercely that sometimes for days together its passage isalmost impossible. No amount of trail making could be of much help, forthe snow smothers up everything on the lee of the hill, and the end ofevery storm presents a new surface and an altered route. A "summit" inthis Alaskan sense is, of course, a saddle between peaks, and in thiscase there is no easier pass and no way around. The only way to avoidthe Eagle summit, without going out of the district altogether, would beto tunnel it.The summit passed, we found better trails and a more frequented country,for in this district are a number of creeks that draw supplies fromCircle City, and that had been worked ten years or more.At the time of the Klondike stampede of 1896-97, Circle City was alreadyestablished as a flourishing mining camp and boasted itself the largestlog-cabin town in the world. Before the Klondike drew away its people asa stronger magnet draws iron filings from a lesser one, Circle had apopulation of about three thousand. Take a town of three thousand andreduce it to thirty or forty, and it is hard to resist the melancholyimpression which entrance upon it in the dusk of the evening brings.There lay the great white Yukon in the middle distance; beyond it theYukon Flats, snow-covered, desolate, stretched away enormously, hedgedhere at their beginning by grey, dim hills. Spread out in the foregroundwere the little, squat, huddling cabins that belonged to no one, withnever a light in a window or smoke from a chimney, the untrodden snowdrifted against door and porch. It would be hard to imagine a drearierprospect, and one had the feeling that it was a city of the dead ratherthan merely a dead city.The weather had grown steadily colder since we reached the Yukon slope,and for two days before reaching Circle the thermometer had stoodbetween 40° and 50° below zero. It was all right for us to push on, thetrail was good and nearly all down-hill, and there were road-housesevery ten or twelve miles. Freighters, weather-bound, came to the doorsas we passed by with our jangle of bells and would raise a somewhatchechaco pride in our breasts by remarking: "You don't seem to care whatweather you travel in!" The evil of it was that the perfectly safetravelling between Eagle Creek and Circle emboldened us to push on fromCircle under totally different conditions, when travelling at such lowtemperatures became highly dangerous and brought us into gravemisadventure that might easily have been fatal catastrophe.Our original start was a week later than had been planned and we hadmade no time, but rather lost it, on this first division of the journey.If we were to reach Bettles on the Koyukuk River for Christmas, therewas no more time to lose, and I was anxious to spend the next Sunday atFort Yukon, three days' journey away. So we started for Fort Yukon onThursday, the 7th of December, the day after we reached Circle.[Sidenote: THE YUKON FLATS]A certain arctic traveller has said that "adventures" always implyeither incompetence or ignorance of local conditions, and there is sometruth in the saying. Our misadventure was the result of a series ofmistakes, no one of which would have been other than discreditable tomen of more experience. Our course lay for seventy-five miles throughthe Yukon Flats, which begin at Circle and extend for two hundred andfifty miles of the river's course below that point. The Flats constitutethe most difficult and dangerous part of the whole length of the YukonRiver, summer or winter, and the section between Circle City and FortYukon is the most difficult and dangerous part of the Flats. Save for a"portage" or land trail of eighteen or twenty miles out of Circle, thetrail is on the river itself, which is split up into many channelswithout salient landmarks. The current is so swift that many stretchesrun open water far into the winter, and blow-holes are numerous. Thereis little travel on the Flats in winter, and a snow-storm accompanied bywind may obliterate what trail there is in an hour. The vehicle used inthe Flats is not a sled but a toboggan, and our first mistake was in notconforming to local usage in this respect. There is always a very goodreason for local usage about snow vehicles. But a toboggan which hadbeen ordered from a native at Fort Yukon would be waiting for us, andit seemed not worth while to go to the expense of buying another merelyfor three days' journey.The second mistake was in engaging a boy as guide instead of a man. Hewas an attractive youth of about fourteen who had done good service atthe Circle City mission the previous winter, when our nurse-in-chargewas contending single-handed against an epidemic of diphtheria. He was apleasant boy, with some English, who wanted to go and professedknowledge of the route. The greatest mistake of all was starting outthrough that lonely waste with the thermometer at 52° below zero. Theold-timers in Alaska have a saying that "travelling at 50° below is allright as long as it's all right." If there be a good trail, if there beconvenient stopping-places, if nothing go wrong, one may travel withoutspecial risk and with no extraordinary discomfort at 50° below zero anda good deal lower. I have since that time made a short day's run at 62°below, and once travelled for two or three hours on a stretch at 65°below. But there is always more or less chance in travelling at lowtemperatures, because a very small thing may necessitate a stop, and astop may turn into a serious thing. At such temperatures one must keepgoing. No amount of clothing that it is possible to wear on the trailwill keep one warm while standing still. For dogs and men alike,constant brisk motion is necessary; for dogs as well as men--even thoughdogs will sleep outdoors in such cold without harm--for they cannot takeas good care of themselves in the harness as they can when loose. Atrace that needs mending, a broken buckle, a snow-shoe string that mustbe replaced, may chill one so that it is impossible to recover one'swarmth again. The bare hand cannot be exposed for many seconds withoutbeginning to freeze; it is dangerous to breathe the air into the lungsfor any length of time without a muffler over the mouth.Our troubles began as soon as we started. The trail was a narrow,winding toboggan track of sixteen or seventeen inches, while our sledwas twenty inches wide, so that one runner was always dragging in theloose snow, and that meant slow, heavy going.[Sidenote: SUNRISE AND SUNSET]The days were nearing the shortest of the year, when, in theselatitudes, the sun does but show himself and withdraw again. But,especially in very cold weather, which is nearly always very clearweather, that brief appearance is preceded by a feast of rich, delicatecolour. First a greenish glow on the southern horizon, brightening intolemon and then into clear primrose, invades the deep purple of thestarry heavens. Then a beautiful circle of blush pink above a circle ofpure amethyst gradually stretches all around the edge of the sky, slowlybrightening while the stars fade out and the heavens change to blue. Thedead white mirror of the snow takes every tint that the skies displaywith a faint but exquisite radiance. Then the sun's disk appears with aflood of yellow light but with no appreciable warmth, and for a littlespace his level rays shoot out and gild the tree tops and the distanthills. The snow springs to life. Dead white no longer, its dry,crystalline particles glitter in myriads of diamond facets with everycolour of the prism. Then the sun is gone, and the lovely circle of rosepink over amethyst again stretches round the horizon, slowly fadinguntil once more the pale primrose glows in the south against the purplesky with its silver stars. Thus sunrise and sunset form a continuousspectacle, with a purity of delicate yet splendid colour that onlyperfectly dry atmosphere permits. The primrose glow, the heraldingcircle, the ball of orange light, the valedictory circle, the primroseglow again, and a day has come and gone. Air can hold no moisture at allat these low temperatures, and the skies are cloudless.[Sidenote: AN ESCAPADE ON THE YUKON]Moreover, in the wilds at 50° below zero there is the most completesilence. All animal life is hidden away. Not a rabbit flits across thetrail; in the absolutely still air not a twig moves. A rare raven passesoverhead, and his cry, changed from a hoarse croak to a sweet liquidnote, reverberates like the musical glasses. There is no more delightfulsound in the wilderness than this occasional lapse into music of theraven. We wound through the scrub spruce and willow and over theniggerhead swamps, a faint tinkle of bells, a little cloud of steam; forin the great cold the moisture of the animals' breath hangs over theirheads in the still air, and on looking back it stands awhile along thecourse at dogs' height until it is presently deposited on twigs andtussocks. We wound along, a faint tinkle of bells, a little cloud ofsteam, and in the midst of the cloud a tousle of shaggy black-and-whitehair and red-and-white pompons--going out of the dead silence behindinto the dead silence before. The dusk came, and still we plodded andpushed our weary way, swinging that heavy sled incessantly, by the geepole in front and the handle-bars behind, in the vain effort to keep iton the trail. Two miles an hour was all that we were making. We had comebut thirteen or fourteen miles out of twenty-four, and it was dark; andit grew colder.The dogs whined and stopped every few yards, worn out by wallowing inthe snow and the labour of the collar. The long scarfs that wrapped ourmouths and noses had been shifted and shifted, as one part after anotherbecame solid with ice from the breath, until over their whole lengththey were stiff as boards. After two more miles of it it was evidentthat we could not reach the mail cabin that night. Then I made my lastand worst mistake. We should have stopped and camped then and there. Wehad tent and stove and everything requisite. But the native boy insistedthat the cabin was "only little way," and any one who knows the miseryof making camp in extremely cold weather, in the dark, will understandour reluctance to do so.I decided to make a cache of the greater part of our load--tent andstove and supplies generally--and to push on to the cabin with but thebedding and the grub box, returning for the stuff in the morning. And,since in the deepest depths of blundering there is a deeper still, bysome one's carelessness, but certainly by my fault, the axe was leftbehind in the cache.With our reduced burden we made better progress, and in a short timereached the end of the portage and came out on the frozen river, just asthe moon, a day or two past the full, rose above the opposite bank. Onesees many strange distortions of sun and moon in this land, but neverwas a stranger seen than this. Her disk, shining through the dense airof the river bottom, was in shape an almost perfect octagon, regular asthough it had been laid off with dividers and a ruler.We were soon in doubt about the trail. The mail-carrier had gone downonly two or three times this winter and each time had taken a differentroute, as more and more of the river closed and gave him more and moredirect passage. A number of Indians had been hunting, and their tracksadded to the tangle of trails. Presently we entered a thick mist thateven to inexperienced eyes spoke of open water or new ice yet moist. Soheavy was the vapour that to the man at the handle-bars the man at thegee pole loomed ghostly, and the man ahead of the dogs could not bedistinguished at all. We had gone so much farther than our native boyhad declared we had to go that we began to fear that in the confusion oftrails we had taken the wrong one and had passed the cabin. That is thetenderfoot's, or, as we say, the chechaco's, fear; it is the one thingthat it may almost be said never happens. But the boy fell downcompletely and was frankly at a loss. All we could get out of him was:"May-be-so we catch cabin bymeby, may-be-so no." If we had passed thecabin it was twenty odd miles to the next; and it grew colder and thedogs were utterly weary again, prone upon the trail at every smallexcuse for a stop, only to be stirred by the whip, heavily wielded.Surely never men thrust themselves foolhardily into worse predicament!Then I made my last mistake. Dimly the bank loomed through the mist, andI said: "We can't go any farther; I think we've missed the trail and I'mgoing across to yon bank to see if there's a place to camp." I had notgone six steps from the trail when the ice gave way under my feet and Ifound myself in water to my hips.[Sidenote: AN ESCAPADE ON THE YUKON]Under Providence I owe it to the mukluks I wore, tied tight round myknees, that I did not lose my life, or at least my feet. The thermometerat Circle City stood at 60° below zero at dark that day, and down on theice it is always about 5° colder than on the bank, because cold air isheavy air and sinks to the lowest level, and 65° below zero means 97°below freezing.My moose-hide breeches froze solid the moment I scrambled out, but not adrop of water got to my feet. If the water had reached my feet theywould have frozen almost as quickly as the moose hide in that fearfulcold. Thoroughly alarmed now, and realising our perilous situation, wedid the only thing there was to do--we turned the dogs loose andabandoned the sled and went back along the trail we had followed as fastas we could. We knew that we could safely retrace our steps and that thetrail would lead us to the bank after a while. We knew not where thetrail would lead us in the other direction. As a matter of fact, it ledto the mail cabin, two miles farther on, and the mail-carrier was atthat time occupying it at the end of his day's run.The dogs stayed with the sled; dogs will usually stay with their sled;they seem to recognise their first allegiance to the load they haul,probably because they know their food forms part of it.Our cache reached, we made a fire, thawed out the iron-like armour of myleather breeches, and cutting a spare woollen scarf in two, wrapped thedry, warm pieces about my numbed thighs. Then we pushed on the eighteenmiles or so to Circle, keeping a steady pace despite the drowsiness thatoppressed us, and that oppressed me particularly owing to the chill ofmy ducking. About five in the morning we reached the town, and theclergyman, the Reverend C. E. Rice, turned out of his warm bed and Iturned in, none the worse in body for the experience, but much humbledin spirit. My companion, Mr. E. J. Knapp, whose thoughtful care for me Ialways look back upon with gratitude, as well as upon Mr. Rice'skindness, froze his nose and a toe slightly, being somewhat neglectfulof himself in his solicitude for me.We had been out about twenty hours in a temperature ranging from 52° to60° below zero, had walked about forty-four miles, labouring incessantlyas well as walking, what time we were with the sled, with nothing toeat--it was too cold to stop for eating--and, in addition to this, oneof us had been in water to the waist, yet none of us took any harm. Itwas a providential overruling of blundering foolhardiness for which wewere deeply thankful.The next day a native with a fast team and an empty toboggan was sentdown to take our load on to the cabin and bring the dogs back.Meanwhile, the mail-carrier had passed the spot, had seen the abandonedsled standing by recently broken ice, and had come on into town while weslept and none knew of our return, with the news that some one had beendrowned. The mail for Fairbanks did but await the mail from Fort Yukon,and the town rumour, instantly identifying the abandoned sled, wascarried across to Fairbanks, to my great distress and annoyance. Theechoes of the distorted account of this misadventure which appeared in aFairbanks newspaper still reverberate in "patent insides" of theprovincial press of the United States.[Sidenote: FORT YUKON ]The next Monday we started again, this time with a toboggan and with aman instead of a boy for guide, and in three days of only moderatedifficulty we reached Fort Yukon.Fort Yukon, though it holds no attraction for the ordinary visitor orthe summer tourist on the river, is a place of much interest to thosewho know the history of Alaska. While it is purely a native village,with no white population save the traders and the usual sprinkling ofmen that hang around native villages, it is yet the oldest white man'spost on the Yukon River, save the post established by the Russians atNulato, five or six hundred miles lower down. The Hudson Bay Companyestablished itself here in 1846, and that date serves as the year onein making calculations and determining ages to this day. It is a fixedpoint in time that every native knows of. Any old man can tell youwhether he was born before or after that date, and, if before, can pickout some boy that is about the age he was when the event occurred. Themassacre at Nulato in 1851 serves in a similar way for the lower river.After the Purchase, and the determination of the longitude of Fort Yukonby Mr. Raymond in 1869--who made the first steamboat journey up theYukon on that errand--the Hudson Bay Company moved three times beforethey succeeded in getting east of the 141st meridian, and at the pointreached on the third move, the New Rampart House on the Porcupine River,only a few hundred yards beyond the boundary-line, they remained untilthe gold excitement on the Yukon and the journeying of the natives tonew posts on that river rendered trading unprofitable; then theywithdrew to the Mackenzie. The oldest white men's graves in Alaska,again with the exception of Nulato, are those in the little Hudson Baycemetery near Fort Yukon.[Sidenote: ARCHDEACON MACDONALD ]Fort Yukon is also the site of the oldest missionary station on theriver, unless there were earlier visits of Russian priests to the lowerriver, of which there seems no record, for in 1862 there was a clergymanof the Church of England at this place. Archdeacon MacDonald was aremarkable man. Married to a native wife, he translated the whole Bibleand the Book of Common Prayer into the native tongue, and histranslations are in general use on the upper river to this day. Hereduced the language to writing, extracted its grammar, taught theIndians to read and write their own tongue, and dignified it by the giftof the great literature of the sacred books. The language is, of course,a dying one--English is slowly superseding it--but it seems safe to saythat for a generation or two yet to come it will be the basis of thecommon speech of the people and the language of worship. It is chieflyin matters of trading and handicrafts that English is taking its place,though here as elsewhere it stands to the discredit of the civilisedrace that blackguard English is the first English that is learned.There seems ground to question whether the substitution of a smatteringof broken English for the flexibility and picturesque expressiveness ofan indigenous tongue, thoroughly understood, carries with it any greatintellectual gain, though to suggest such a doubt is treason to someminds. The time threatens when all the world will speak two or threegreat languages, when all little tongues will be extinct and all littlepeoples swallowed up, when all costume will be reduced to a dead levelof blue jeans and shoddy and all strange customs abolished. The worldwill be a much less interesting world then; the spice and savour of theends of the earth will be gone. Nor does it always appear unquestionablethat the world will be the better or the happier. The advance ofcivilisation would be a great thing to work for if we were quite surewhat we meant by it and what its goal is. To the ordinary governmentschool-teacher in Alaska, with some notable exceptions, it seems tomean chiefly teaching the Indians to call themselves Mr. and Mrs. andteaching the women to wear millinery, with a contemptuous attitudetoward the native language and all native customs. The less intelligentgrade of missionary sometimes falls into the same easy rut. So letterspass through the post-offices addressed: "Mr. Pretty Henry," "Mrs.Monkey Bill," "Miss Sally Shortandirty"; so, occasionally, the grotesquespectacle may present itself, to the passengers on a steamer, of anative woman in a "Merry Widow" hat and a blood-stained parkee guttingsalmon on the river bank.The nobler ideal, as it seems to some of us, is to labour forGod-fearing, self-respecting Indians rather than imitation white men andwhite women. An Indian who is honest, healthy and kindly, skilled inhunting and trapping, versed in his native Bible and liturgy, eventhough he be entirely ignorant of English and have acquired no taste forcanned fruit and know not when Columbus discovered America, may be verymuch of a man in that station of life in which it has pleased God tocall him.Christmas and the Fourth of July are the Indian's great holidays, theone just after the best moose hunting and the other just before thesalmon run. It may be supposed that there were always great feasts atthe winter and summer solstices, though now he is sufficiently devout atthe one and patriotic at the other. At these seasons, and for weeksbefore and after, Fort Yukon gathers a large number of Indians. It isthe native metropolis of the country within a radius of a hundredmiles, and what may be termed its permanent population of one hundredand fifty is doubled and sometimes trebled by contingents from theChandalar, the Porcupine, and the Black Rivers, from that long rivercalled Birch Creek, and all the intervening country. Many families ofthe "uncivilised," self-respecting kind, to which reference has beenmade, come in from outlying points, and the contrast between them andtheir more sophisticated kinfolk of the town is all in their favour.[Sidenote: JIMMY]Such a gathering had already taken place in preparation for theChristmas holidays when we reached Fort Yukon on the 15th of December.It would have been pleasant to spend Christmas with them, but we weredue two hundred and fifty miles away, at Bettles, for that feast, if byany means we could get there. So we lingered but the two days necessaryto equip ourselves. Jimmy had torn our bedding to pieces on the night ofthe mishap; it was lashed on the outside of the load, and he hadscratched and clawed it to make a nest for himself until fur from therobe and feathers from the quilts were all over the trail. The otherdogs, not so warmly coated as he, had been content to sleep in the snow.Jimmy's character was gradually revealing itself. A well-bred trail dogwill not commit the canine sacrilege of invading the sled. That is a"Siwash" dog's trick. So there was fresh bedding to manufacture, as wellas supplies for two hundred miles to get together.A mail once a month went at that time from Fort Yukon to the Koyukuk,and there was little other travel. The course lay fifty or sixty milesacross country to the Chandalar River, about one hundred miles up thatstream, and then across a divide to the South Fork of the Koyukuk, andacross another to the Middle Fork, on which Coldfoot is situated. It isnot possible to procure any supplies, save sometimes a little fish fordog food and that not certainly, between Fort Yukon and Coldfoot, sothat provision for the whole journey must be taken.[Sidenote: THE CHANDALAR]A new Indian guide had been engaged as far as Coldfoot, and we setout--three men, two toboggans, and seven dogs; four on the largervehicle and three on the smaller, one of the dogs brought by our guide.Three miles from Fort Yukon we crossed the Porcupine River and thenplunged into the wilderness of lake and swamp and forest that stretchesnorth of the Yukon. A portage trail, as such a track across country iscalled to distinguish it from a river trail, has the advantage of suchprotection from storm as its timbered stretches afford. For miles andmiles the route passes through scrub spruce that has been burned over,with no prospect but a maze of charred poles against the snow, someupright, others at every angle of inclination. Then comes a lake, withdifficulty in finding the trail on its wind-swept surface and sometimesmuch casting about to discover where it leaves the lake again, and thenmore small burned timber. Wherever the route is through woods, living ordead, it is blazed; when it strikes the open, one is often at a loss.After three or four days of such travel, sometimes reaching an old cabinfor the night, sometimes pitching the tent, one is rejoiced at thesight of distant mountains and at the intimation they bring that theinexpressible dreariness of the Yukon Flats is nearly past; andpresently the trail opens suddenly upon the broad Chandalar.The Hudson Bay voyageurs are responsible for many names in this part ofAlaska, and Chandalar is a corruption of their "Gens de large." Thevarious native tribes received appellations indicating habitats. A tribethat differed from most northern Indians, in having no permanentvillages and in living altogether in encampments, was named "Gens delarge," and the river which they frequented took their name.It is one of the second-rate tributaries of the Yukon, and in generalits waters are swift and shallow, not navigable for light-draughtsteamboats for more than one hundred and fifty miles, save at flood, andnot easily navigable at all. It is these swift shallow streams that areso formidable in winter on account of overflow water, and the Chandalaris one of the most dreaded.[Sidenote: DIPHTHERIA]Ten miles along the river's surface brought us to the Chandalar nativevillage, a settlement of half a dozen cabins and twenty-five or thirtysouls. The people came out to meet us, and said they were just about tobury a baby, and asked me to conduct the funeral. Because we had notdone a day's march and were under compulsion to push on at our bestspeed, I did not unlash the sled but went just as I was up the hill withthe sorrowful procession to the little graveyard. On the way down Iasked as best I could of what sickness the baby had died, and I feltsome uneasiness when the throat was pointed to as the seat of disease.When, presently, I was informed that two others were sick, and of thesame complaint, my uneasiness became alarm. I went at once to see them,and the angry swollen throats patched with white membrane which Idiscovered left no room for doubt that we were in the presence ofanother outbreak of diphtheria. That disease had scourged the Yukon inthe two preceding years. Twenty-three children died at Fort Yukon in thesummer of 1904, half a dozen at Circle in the following winter, thoughthat outbreak was grappled with from the first; and all along the riverthe loss of life was terrible.There was no question that we must give up all hope of reaching Bettlesfor Christmas and stay and do what we could for these people. So we madecamp on the outskirts of the village, and I went to work swabbing outthe throats with carbolic acid and preparing liquid food from our grubbox. There was nothing to eat in the village but dried fish and a littledried moose, and these throats like red-hot iron could hardly swallowliquids. The two patients were a boy of sixteen and a grown woman. Itwas evident that unless we could isolate them the disease would probablypass through the whole village, and, indeed, others might have beeninfected already. It was likely that we were in for a siege of it, andour supply of condensed milk and extract of beef would soon beexhausted. Moreover, at Fort Yukon was the trained nurse who had copedwith the epidemic there and at Circle, while we had virtually noexperience with the disease at all. It was resolved to send back to FortYukon for supplies and for the nurse.The next morning Mr. Knapp and the native boy took the dogs and the sledand started back. With no load save a little grub and bedding, theycould make the journey in two days, a day must be allowed forpreparations, and, with the aid of another dog team, two days more wouldbring them back. Five days was the least they could be gone. It wasasking a great deal of this lady to abandon her Christmas festival,preparations for which had long been making, and to come sixty-fivemiles through the frozen wilderness in a toboggan; but I felt sure shewould drop everything and come.For those five days I was busied in close attention to the patients andin strenuous though not altogether availing efforts to maintain aquarantine of the cabin in which they lay. There was little more that Icould do than swab out the throats and administer food every two hours.As the disease advanced it was increasingly painful to swallow andexceedingly difficult to induce the sufferers to make the attempt or toopen their mouths for the swabbing. After two or three days the womanseemed to have passed the crisis of the disease and to be mending, butthe boy, I thought, grew worse. One becomes attached to those to whomone ministers, and this poor, speechless boy, with his terrible throatand the agony in his big black eyes, appealed to me very stronglyindeed. It was torture to move his head or to open his mouth, and I hadto torture him continually.Every night I gathered the people for Divine service. Here was a littlecommunity far off in the wilds that had carefully conserved and handedon to their children the teaching they had received no less than thirtyyears before. The native Bibles and prayer-books and hymnals werebrought out, bearing dates of publication in the seventies; one of theirnumber acted as leader, and what he read was painfully followed in thewell-thumbed books. They lifted their voices in a weird transformationof familiar tunes, with quavers and glides that had crept in throughlong, uncorrected use, and amongst the prayers said was one for "OurSovereign lady Queen Victoria, and Albert Edward, Prince of Wales." Itried to explain that Queen Victoria was dead, that they were not livingunder British rule, and I took a pencil and struck out the prayers forthe royal family from the books. But there was doubt in their minds anda reluctance to alter in any particular the liturgy that had been taughtthem, and it is quite likely that intercessions for a defunct sovereignof another land still arise from the Chandalar village. One cannot butfeel a deep admiration for the pioneer missionaries of thisregion--Bishop Bompas, Archdeacon MacDonald, and the others--whoseteaching was so thorough and so lasting, and who lived and laboured herelong before any gold seeker had thought of Alaska, when the country wasan Indian country exclusively, with none of the comforts andconveniences that can now be enjoyed. It was to a remote cabin on theEast Fork of this river that Archdeacon MacDonald retired for a year tomake part of his translation of the Bible, according to the Indianaccount.[Sidenote: THE SHORTEST DAY]At noon on the 21st of December, the shortest day, there is a note in mydiary that I saw the sun's disk shining through the trees. Althoughfully half a degree of latitude north of the Arctic Circle, therefraction is sufficient to lift his whole sphere above the horizon. Onespeculates how much farther north it would be possible to see any partof the sun at noon on the shortest day; but north of here, throughoutAlaska, is broken and mountainous country. We were on the northern edgeof the great flat of the interior.The fifth day at the village was Christmas Eve. My boy was in a criticalcondition, very low and weak, with a temperature that stayed around 101°and 102°. As night approached I watched with the greatest anxiety forthe party from Fort Yukon, and, just as the last lingering glow of thelong twilight was fading from the south, there was a distant tinkle ofbells on the trail, and faintly once and again a man's voice was raisedin command and I knew that relief was at hand.The nurse had dropped everything and had come, as I felt sure she would.Gathering medicines and supplies and hiring a native dog team anddriver, she had left immediately, and the round trip had been made inthe shortest time it was possible to make it. It was a tremendous reliefto see her step out of the rugs and robes of the toboggan and takecharge of the situation in her quiet, competent way. A small, outlyingcabin was selected for a hospital, the family that occupied it bundledout into a tent, and the two sick persons carefully moved into it, withwhom and the mother of the sick boy the nurse took up her abode. Thenthere was the Christmas-tree in the chief's cabin, with little gifts forthe children sent out from the mission at Fort Yukon some time before,and a dance afterward, for Christmas festivities must go on, whateverhappens, at a native village. I took James's pocket-knife to him afterthe celebration was over, and I think he really tried to smile as hethanked me with his eyes.The next day after the services, although it was Christmas Day, we setto work on the disinfecting of the large cabin in which the sick hadlain. Stringing bedclothes and wearing apparel on lines from wall towall, and stuffing up every crack and cranny with cotton, we burnedquantities of sulphur, that the nurse had brought with her, all daylong.A recent article in a stray number of a professional journal picked upin the office of a medical missionary, devoted column after column tothe uselessness of all known methods of disinfection. Sulphur,formaldehyde, carbolic acid, permanganate of potash, chloride of lime,bichloride of mercury--the author knew not which of these "fetiches" tobe most sarcastic about. It may be that the net result of our copiousfumigation was but the bleaching of the coloured garments hung up, butat least it did no harm. One sometimes wishes that these scientists whosit up so high in the seat of the scornful would condescend to a littleplain instruction.The anti-diphtheritic serum is now kept in readiness at all ourmissions in Alaska, and the disease seems to have ceased itsdepredations; but it has taken terrible toll of the native people.[Sidenote: THE MISSIONARY NURSE]We wished to stay with the nurse until the sickness should be done, butshe would not hear of it, and insisted upon the resumption of ourjourney. It did not seem right to go off and leave this lonely woman,sixty-five miles from the nearest white person, to cope with an outbreakof disease that might not yet have spent itself, although there had beenno new case for a week. "You've done your work here, now leave me to domine. You'll not get to Point Hope this winter if you stay much longer.""Aren't you afraid to stay all by yourself?" I asked, somewhatfatuously."Afraid? Afraid of what? You surely don't mean afraid of the natives?"I did not know what I meant; it seemed not unnatural that a woman withsuch prospect before her should be a little timid, but she was resolutethat we go, and we went.Not until the next summer did I learn the upshot--both patientsrecovered and there was no other case. Six years later, when these wordsare written, I have just baptized a son of the boy who lay so ill, whowould have perished, I think, had we not reached the Chandalar villagejust in time.CHAPTER IICHANDALAR VILLAGE TO BETTLES, COLDFOOT, AND THE KOYUKUKAT five o'clock in the morning of the 27th of December, hours before anykind of daylight, while the faint "pit-pat" of all-night dancing stillsounded from the chief's cabin, we dropped down the steep bank to theriver surface and resumed our journey. Ahead was a man with a candle ina tin can, peering for the faint indications of the trail on the ice;the other two were at the handle-bars of the toboggans. It is strangethat in this day of invention and improvement in artificialillumination, a candle in a tin can is still the most dependable lightfor the trail. A coal-oil lamp requires a glass which is easily broken,and the ordinary coal-oil that comes to Alaska freezes at about 40°below. In very cold weather a coal-oil lantern full of oil will go outcompletely from the freezing of its supply. All the various acetylenelamps are useless because water is required to generate the gas, andwater may not be had without stopping and building a fire and meltingice or snow. The electric flash-lamp, useful enough round camp, goes outof operation altogether on the trail, because the "dry" cell thatsupplies its current is not a dry cell at all, but a moist cell, andwhen its moisture freezes is dead until it thaws out again. No extremityof cold will stop a candle from burning, and if it be properly shelteredby the tin can it will stand a great deal of wind. The "folding pocketlantern," which is nothing but a convenient tin can with mica sides, isthe best equipment for travel, but an empty butter can or lard can issometimes easier to come by.The Chandalar is wide-spread in these parts, with several channels, andthe trail was hard to follow. One track we pursued led us up a bank andalong a portage and presently stopped at a marten trap; and we had tocut across to the river and cast about hither and thither on its broadsurface to find the mail trail.[Sidenote: THE CHANDALAR GAP]All the rivers that are confluent with the Yukon in the Flats enter thatdreary region through gaps in the mountains that bound the broad plain.These gaps are noted for wind, and the Chandalar Gap, which had loomedbefore us since daybreak, is deservedly in especial bad repute. The mosthateful thing in the Arctic regions is the wind. Cold one may protectone's self against, but there is no adequate protection against wind.The parkee without opening front or back, that pulls on over the head,is primarily a windbreak, and when a scarf is wrapped around mouth andnose, and the fur-edged hood of the parkee is pulled forward over capand scarf, the traveller who must face the wind has done all he can toprotect himself from it.[Illustration: SUNRISE ON THE CHANDALAR-KOYUKUK PORTAGE.]Unfortunately, in the confusion of striking the tent and packing in thedark, my scarf had been rolled up in the bedding, and, since the windwas not bad until we approached the Gap in the evening, I had nottroubled about it. Now, as we drew nearer and nearer, the wind roseconstantly. The thermometer was at 38° below zero, and wind at thattemperature cuts like a knife. But to get my scarf meant stopping thewhole procession and unlashing and unloading the sled, and the man whounlashed in that wind would almost certainly freeze his fingers. So Igave up the thought of it, turned my back to the wind while I tied mypocket handkerchief round mouth and nose, drew the strings of my parkeehood close, and then faced it again to worry through as best I could.The ice is always swept clear of snow in the Gap. The river narrowswithin its jaws, the ragged rocks rise up to the bluffs on either hand,and the blue-streaked ice stretches between. We all suffered a gooddeal. Against that cruel wind it was impossible to keep warm. The hands,though enclosed in woollen gloves, and they in blanket-lined moose-hidemitts, grew numb; the toes, within their protection of caribou sock withthe hair on, strips of blanket wrapping, and mukluks stuffed with hay,tingled with warning of frost-bite; the whole body was chilled. We allfroze our faces, I think, for the part of the face around and betweenthe eyes cannot be covered. I froze my cheeks, my nose, and my Adam'sapple, the last a most inconvenient thing to freeze.[Illustration: COLDFOOT ON THE KOYUKUK.][Sidenote: A COLD LODGING]The cabin was just the other side of the Gap, and it was well that itwas no farther, for we were weary with our thirty-mile run anddangerously cold with the exposure of the last hour. It was rather alarge cabin as trail cabins go, with a rickety sheet-iron stove in themiddle, burned full of holes, and it was hours before the fire began tomake any impression on the obstinate, sullen cold of that hut. When wewent to bed the frost still stood thick and heavy on the walls all overthe room. A log building, properly constructed, is a warm building, butslowness in parting with heat means slowness in receiving heat, and alog cabin that has been unoccupied for a long time in very cold weatheris hard to heat in one evening.When we started next morning the thermometer stood at 45° below zero,but we were out of the wind region and did not mind the cold. It iscurious that a few miles on either side of that Gap the air will bestill, while in the Gap itself a gale is blowing. Seven times I havepassed through that Gap and only once without wind. The great Flats werenow behind us, we had passed into the mountains, and for the remainderof our long journey we should scarce ever be out of sight of mountainsagain. Up the river, with its constant trouble of overflow, going aroundthe open water whenever we could, plunging through it in our muklukswhen it could not be avoided--with the care of the dogs' feet that thecold weather rendered more than ever necessary when they got wet, andthe added nuisance of throwing the toboggans on their sides and beatingthe ice from them with the flat of the axe wherever water had beenpassed through--for two days we followed its windings, the thermometerbetween -45° and -50°, the mountains rising higher and the scenerygrowing more picturesque as we advanced. At the end of the second dayfrom the Gap we were at the mouth of the West Fork of the Chandalar, andafter passing up it for fifteen or sixteen miles we left thatwatercourse to cross the mountains to the South Fork of the KoyukukRiver.Then began hard labour again. A toboggan is not a good vehicle forcrossing summits. Its bottom is perfectly flat and smooth, polished likeglass by the friction of the snow. If the trail be at all "sidling" (andmountain trails are almost always "sidling"), the toboggan swings off onthe side of the inclination and must be kept on the trail by main force.The runners of a sled will grip the surface, if there be anyinequalities at all, but a toboggan swings now this way and now that,like a great pendulum, dragging the near dogs with it. Again and againwe had to hitch both teams to one toboggan to get up a sidling pitchwhile all hands kept the vehicle on the trail, and our progress waspainful and slow. In soft snow on a level surface like the river bed orthrough the Flat country, generally, the toboggan is much the moreconvenient vehicle, for it rides over the snow instead of ploughingthrough it, but on hard snow anywhere or on grades the toboggan is anuisance. Thus wallowing through the deep snow at the side of thetoboggans to hold them in place we sweated and slaved our way mile aftermile up the gradual ascent until we reached the spot, just under ashoulder of the summit, where there was dry spruce and green spruce forcamping, the dry for fire and the green for couch, and there we haltedfor the night.[Sidenote: JOHN MUIR]Next morning we crossed the low pass and dropped down easily into thewide valley of the Koyukuk South Fork, with a fine prospect of mountainseverywhere as far as the eye could see. I had stood and gazed upon thosesame mountains on my journey of the previous winter, my first winter inAlaska, and had seen a most remarkable sight. As we began the descentand a turn of the trail gave a new panorama of peaks I did not at firstrealise the nature of the peculiar phenomenon I was gazing at. Each peakhad a fine, filmy, fan-shaped cloud stretching straight out from it intothe sky, waving and shimmering as it stretched. The sun was not abovethe horizon, but his rays caught these sheer, lawn-like streamers andplayed upon them with a most delicate opalescent radiance. Then all atonce came to my mind the recollection of a description in John Muir's_Mountains of California_ (surely the finest mountain book ever written)of the snow banners of the Sierra Nevada, and I knew that I was lookingat a similar spectacle. It meant that a storm was raging on high,although so far we were sheltered from it. It meant that the dry,sand-like snow of the mountain flanks was driven up those flanks sofiercely before the wind that it was carried clean over them and beyondthem out into the sky, and still had such pressure behind it that itcontinued its course and spread out horizontally, thinning and spreadingfor maybe a mile before it lost all coherence and visibility. As far asI could see mountain peaks I could see the snow banners, all pointingone way, all waving, all luminous and shimmering in the sun-rays. It wasa very noble sight, and I gazed a long while entranced, not knowing howominous it was. When we reached the valley and left the shelter of thegulch we struck the full force of that fearful gale, and for two daysand nights of incessant blizzard we lay in a hole dug out of a sand-bank(for we had no tent that year), the trail lost, the grub box nearlyempty, and no fire possible to cook anything with had the grub box beenfull.The valley before us--to resume the narrative--is a high, wind-sweptregion of niggerhead and swamp, the catch-basin of the South Fork of theKoyukuk River. The trail descends one of its southern draws, follows upthe main valley awhile, crosses it, and leaves by one of its northerndraws to pass over the mountains that separate its drainage from themain fork of the Koyukuk. The cold had given place to wind, and thoughthe gale did not approach the fierceness of last year's storm, it gavegreat trouble in following the track. These high headwater basins arealways windy; the timber is scrubby spruce with many open places, and insuch open places the trail is soon obliterated altogether.When the light fails this casting about for blazes whenever a clump ofspruce is reached becomes increasingly slow and difficult and at lastbecomes hopeless. The general direction determined, it might be thoughtthat the traveller could ignore the tracks of previous passage andstrike out for himself, but he knows that the trail, however rough, isat least practicable, whereas an independent course may soon lead tosteep gullies or cut banks, or may entangle him in some thicket that hemust resort to the axe to pass through. Moreover, even two or threepassages through the snow in the winter will give some bottom to atrail; a bottom that, when the wind-swept areas are passed and thesnow-shoes are resumed, both he and his dogs will be thankful for.[Sidenote: CAMP MAKING]So we made a camp as it darkened to night, not far from the spot where Ihad "siwashed" with an Indian companion the previous winter, the windblowing half a gale at 20° below zero.Making camp under such circumstances is always a very disagreeableproceeding. It takes time and care to make a comfortable camp, and timeand care in the wind and the cold involve suffering. Two suitable treesmust be selected between which the tent is to be suspended by theridge-rope, and the snow must all be scraped away by the snow-shoes, or,if it be too deep, beaten down. Then while one man unlashes and unpacksthe sleds, another cuts green spruce and lays it all over the tentspace, thicker and finer where the bed is to be. Then up goes the tent,its corner ropes and its side strings made fast to boughs, if there besuch, or to stakes, or to logs laid parallel to the sides. Then thestovepipe is jointed and the stove set up on the edge of green billetsproperly shaped. Meanwhile the axe-man, the green boughs cut, has beenfelling and splitting a dry tree for stove wood, and the wholeproceedings are rushed and hastened towards getting a fire in thatstove. Sometimes it is a question whether we shall get a fire before wefreeze our fingers or freeze our fingers before we get a fire. The fireonce going, we are safe, for however much more work there is in theopen, and there is always a good deal more, one can go to the tent toget warm. Enough stove wood must be cut, not only for night and morning,but for cooking the dog feed. The dog pot, filled with snow, into whichthe fish are cut up, is put upon the outdoor fire as soon as man-supperbegins cooking in the tent. When it boils, the rice and tallow must beadded, and when the rice has boiled twenty minutes the whole is setaside to cool. Meanwhile the two aluminum pots full of snow, replenishedfrom time to time as it melts, are put upon the stove in the tent as thenecessary preliminary to cooking. Sometimes ice, and more rarely water,may be had, and then supper is hastened. If we are camped on the riverbank sometimes a steel-pointed rifle-bullet fired straight down into theice will penetrate to the water below and allow a little jet to bubbleup. Melting snow is a tedious business at best; but, since three timesout of four when camping it must be done, the aluminum pots are atreasure. There is still work for every one as well as the cook. Snowmust be banked all round the tent to keep out the wind. Little heaps ofspruce boughs must be cut for the dogs' beds; it is all we can do forthem whatever the weather, and they appreciate it highly. It may be thatdog moccasins must be taken off and strung around the stove to dry, andbefore supper is ready the inside ridge-rope of the tent is heavy withall sorts of drying man-wear: socks, moccasins, scarfs, toques,mittens. One of the earliest habits a man learns on the trail is to hangup everything to dry as soon as he takes it off. Why should it be hungup to dry unless it has got wet? the writer was once asked, in detailingthese operations. Because there is no other way to remove the ice withwhich everything becomes incrusted in very cold weather.[Sidenote: CAMP COOKING]As his snow melts the cook throws into the pot a few handfuls ofevaporated potatoes, a handful of evaporated onions, and smallerquantities of evaporated "soup vegetables," and leaves them to soak andsimmer and resume their original size and flavour. By and by he will cutup the moose meat or the rabbits or birds, or whatever game he may have,and throw it in, and in an hour or an hour and a half there will be asavoury stew that, with a pan of biscuits cooked in an aluminumreflector beside the stove and a big pot of tea, constitutes theprincipal meal of the day. Or if the day has been long and sleep seemsmore attractive even than grub, he will turn some frozen beans, alreadyboiled, into a frying-pan with a big lump of butter, and when his meatis done supper is ready. Beans thus prepared eaten red hot with gratedcheese are delicious to a hungry man. With the stove for a sideboard,food may always be eaten hot, and that is one advantage of camp fare.The men satisfied, the dogs remain, and while two of the party washdishes and clean up, the third feeds the dogs. Their pot of food hasbeen cooling for an hour or more. They will not eat it until it is coldand a mess of rice will hold heat a long time even in the coldestweather. When it is nearly cold it is dished out with a paddle into theindividual pans and the dogs make short work of it. There are some whofeed straight fish, and, if the fish be king salmon of the best quality,the dogs do well enough on it. But on any long run it is decidedlyeconomical to cook for the dogs--not so much from the standpoint ofdirect cost as from that of weight and ease of hauling. An hundredpounds of fish plus an hundred pounds of rice plus fifty pounds oftallow will go a great deal farther than two hundred and fifty pounds offish alone. There is little doubt, too, that in the long run the dogs dobetter on cooked food. It is easier of digestion and easier to apportionin uniform rations. Rice and fish make excellent food. The Japs tookPort Arthur on rice and fish. The tallow answers a demand of the climateand is increased as the weather grows colder. Man and dog alike requirequantities of fat food in this climate; it is astonishing how much baconand butter one can eat. When the dogs have eaten, and each one has madethe rounds of all the other pans to be sure nothing is left, they retireto their respective nests of spruce bough and curl themselves up withmany turnings round and much rearranging of the litter. Feet and noseare neatly tucked in, the tail is adjusted carefully over all, the hairon the body stands straight up, and the dogs have gone to bed and do notlike to be disturbed again.[Sidenote: DOG-HARNESS]Therein lies the cruelty of depriving them of their tails, which usedto be the general custom in this country. The old tandem harness almostrequired it, as the breath of the dog behind condensed upon the tail ofthe dog in front until he was carrying around permanently a mass of icethat was a burden to him and rendered his tail useless for warmth. Butthe rig with a long mid rope, to which the dogs are attached bysingle-trees in such manner that they may at will be hitched abreast orone ahead of the other as the trail is wide or narrow, is supersedingthe tandem rig, and one sees more bushy tails amongst the dogs. Thethick, long-haired tail of the dog in this country is indeed hisblanket, and in cold weather the tailless dog is at a greatdisadvantage.It was said that all the dogs retired to the nests of spruce bough; itshould have been all but one. It is Lingo's special charge to guard thesled and his special privilege to sleep on it. Turning around andcurling up on the softest spot he can find of the unlashed and partlyunloaded toboggan, he will not touch anything it contains nor permit anyother dog to touch it.The northern skies are clouded the next morning, the first day of thenew year, and there is a ruddy dawn that is glorious to behold. Thewhite earth gives back a soft rose tint, as an organ pipe gives back afaint tone to the strong vibration of another pipe in pitch with it. Weshall not see the sun himself any more for many weeks, but we see hislight upon the flanks of the mountains for an hour or so around noon.The bold, shapely peaks of the South Fork of the Koyukuk turn theirsnows to pink fire as his rays slowly descend their sides, and thewhole scene is exquisitely beautiful. What a wonderful thing colour is!When the skies are overcast this is a dead black-and-white country inwinter, for spruce, the prevailing wood, is black in the mass at alittle distance. Gaze where one will, there is naught but black andwhite. The eye becomes tired of the monotony and longs for some warmertone. That is surely the reason why all those who live in the countrycherish some gay article of attire, why the natives love brillianthandkerchiefs, why the white man also will choose a crimson scarf.Trudging at the handle-bars, I have found pleasure in the red pompons ofthe dogs' harness, in the gay beading of mitten and hind-sack. And thatis why a lavish feast of colour such as this dawn stirs one's spiritwith such keen delight. It gives life to a dead world.But the wind is still bitter and interferes sadly with one's enjoyment.All through the valley, up the creek by which we leave it, past the twinlakes on the low summit, the wind grows in force, and when we leaveSlate Creek for the present and make a "portage" over a mountainshoulder to strike the creek again much lower down, the wind has risento a gale that overturns the toboggans and makes the men fight for theirfooting. The actual physical labour of it is enormous, and there can beno rest; it is too bitterly cold in that blast to stop. For a mile ortwo we struggle and slave to beat our way around that mountain shoulderand then drop down to the creek again. The blessed relief it is to getout of the fury of that wind into the comparative shelter of the creek,to be done with the ceaseless toil of holding the heavy toboggans fromhurtling down the hillside, to be able to keep one's feet withoutcontinually slipping and falling on the wind-hardened snow, no words canadequately convey. We are all frozen again a little; this man's nose istouched, that man's cheeks, and the other man's finger.[Sidenote: THE KOYUKUK GOLD CAMP]On the middle fork of the Koyukuk, at the mouth of Slate Creek, Coldfootsits within a cirque of rugged mountain peaks, the most northerly postaltown in the interior of Alaska, the most northerly gold-mining town inthe world, as it claims. It sprang into existence in 1900 and flourishedfor a season or two with the usual accompaniments of such florification.In 1906 it was already much decayed, and is now dead. Ever since itsstart the Koyukuk camp has steadily produced gold and given occupationto miners numbering from one hundred and fifty to three hundred, but thescene of operations, and therefore the depot for supplies, hascontinually changed. In 1900 the chief producing creek was Myrtle, whichis a tributary of Slate Creek, and the town at the mouth was in eligiblesituation, though much over-built from the first. Then the centre ofinterest shifted to Nolan Creek, fifteen miles farther up the river,which is a tributary of Wiseman Creek, and the town of Wiseman sprang upat the mouth of that creek. The post-office, the commissioner's office,and the saloon, the stores and road-houses, migrated to the new spot,and Coldfoot was abandoned. Now the chief producing creek is the HammondRiver, still farther up the Koyukuk, and if its placer deposits proveas rich as they promise it is likely that a town will spring up at themouth of the Hammond which will supersede Wiseman.There has never been found a continuous pay-streak in the Koyukuk camp.It is what is known as a "pocket" camp. Now and again a "spot" is foundwhich enriches its discoverers, while on the claims above and below thatspot the ground may be too poor to work at a profit; for ground must berich to be worked at all in the Koyukuk. It is the most expensive campin Alaska, perhaps in the world. This is due to its remoteness anddifficulty of access. Far north of the Arctic Circle, the diggings areabout seventy-five miles above the head of light-draught steamboatnavigation, and more than six hundred miles above the confluence of theKoyukuk with the Yukon. Transshipped at Nulato to the shoal-watersteamboats that make three or four trips a season up the Koyukuk,transshipped again at Bettles, the head of any steamboat navigation,freight must be hauled on horse scows the remaining seventy-five milesof the journey; and all that handling and hauling means high rates. Thecost of living, the cost of machinery, the general cost of all miningoperations is much higher than on the Yukon or on the other tributariesof that river. The very smallness of the camp is a factor in the highprices, for there is not trade enough to induce brisk competition withthe reduction of rates that competition brings.[Sidenote: MINERS' GENEROSITY]Yet the smallness and the isolation of the camp have theircompensations. There is more community life, more _esprit de corps_amongst the Koyukuk miners than will be found in any other camp inAlaska. Thrown upon their own resources for amusement, social gatheringsare more common and are made more of, and hospitality is universal. Likeall sparsely settled and frontier lands, Alaska is a very hospitableplace in general, but the Koyukuk has earned the name of the mosthospitable camp in Alaska. Since the numbers are small, and each man iswell known to all the others, any sickness or suffering makes animmediate appeal and brings a generous response. Again and again theunfortunate victim of accident or disease has been sent outside fortreatment, the considerable money required being quickly raised bypublic subscription. There is probably no other gold camp in the worldwhere it is a common thing for the owner of a good claim to tell aneighbour who is "broke" to take a pan and go down to the drift and helphimself.Until my visit of the previous year no minister of religion of any sorthad penetrated to the Koyukuk, and, save for one journey thither byBishop Rowe, my annual visits have been the only opportunities forpublic worship since. It will suffice for the visit now describing aswell as for all the others to say that the reception was most cordialand the opportunity much appreciated. We went from creek to creek andgathered the men and the few women in whatever cabin was mostconvenient, and no clergyman could wish for more attentive or interestedcongregations.[Illustration: THE UPPER KOYUKUK.]Upon our return to Coldfoot from the creek visits the thermometer stoodat 52° below zero, although it had been no lower than 38° below when weleft the last creek, some fifteen miles away. As a general rule, thetemperature on these mountain creeks, which are at some considerableelevation above the river into which they flow, will read from 10° to15° higher than on the river, and if one climbed to the top of the peaksaround Coldfoot, the difference then would probably be 20° or 25°. Atthe summit road-house between Fairbanks and Cleary City in the Tananacountry in cold weather the thermometer commonly reads 20° above the oneplace and 10° or 15° above the other.[Illustration: THE BARREN SHORES OF KOTZEBUE SOUND.][Sidenote: LINGO]This interesting fact, which surprises a good many people, for we areused to think of elevated places as cold places, is due to the greaterheaviness of cold air, which sinks to the lowest level it can reach; andthe river bed is the lowest part of the country. It would be interestingto find out to what extent this rule holds good. The ridges and thehilltops are always the warmest places in cold weather; would this holdas regards mountain tops?--as regards high mountain tops? Probably itwould hold in the sunshine, but the rapid radiation of heat in therarefied atmosphere of mountain tops would swing the balance the otherway after dark. There is no doubt, however, that the coldest place incold weather in Alaska is the river surface, and it is on the riversurface that most of our travelling is done. The night we returned toColdfoot we put our toboggan up high on the roof of an outhouse to keepits skin sides from the teeth of some hungry native dogs, leaving someof the load that was not required within it, covered by the sledcloth. Later on I saw by the light of the moon Lingo's silhouettedfigure sitting bolt upright on top of the sled, and he gave his shortdouble bark as I drew near to make me notice that he was still doing hisduty although under difficulties. The dog had climbed up a wood-pile andhad jumped to the top of the outhouse and so to the sled. I thought ofKipling's _Men That Fought at Minden_:        "For fatigue it was their pride         And they would _not_ be denied         To clean the cook-house floor."Here at Coldfoot we came first into contact with that interesting tribeof wandering inland Esquimaux known as the Kobuks, from their occupationof the river of that name. The Koyukuk has its own Indian people, butthese enterprising Kobuks have pushed their way farther and farther fromsalt water into what used to be exclusive Indian territory.Representatives of both races were at Coldfoot, and as we layweather-bound for a couple of days, I was enabled to renew last year'sacquaintance with them, though without a good interpreter not muchprogress was made. The delight of these people at the road-housephonograph, the first they had ever heard, was some compensation for theincessant snarl and scream of the instrument itself. It was very funnyto see them sitting on the floor, roaring with laughter at oneparticularly silly spoken record of the "Uncle Josh at the World's Fair"order. Over and over again they would ask for that record, and it neverceased to convulse them with laughter. "He's been enjoyin' poor healthlately, but this mornin' I heard him complain that he felt a littlebetter"--how sick and tired we got of this and similar jokes drawled outa dozen times running! The natives did not understand a word of it; itwas the human voice with its pronounced, unusual inflections thataroused their merriment. The phonograph is becoming a powerful agencyfor disseminating a knowledge of English amongst the natives throughoutAlaska, and one wishes that it were put to better use than thereproduction of silly and often vulgar monologue and dialogue and trashyragtime music. As an index of the taste of those who purchase records,the selection brought to this country points low.The third day the thermometer stood at -49° and we were free to leavewithout actually breaking the rule we had made after the escapade on theYukon. Two other teams were going down the river, so we started withthem on the sixty-five mile journey to Bettles. Twenty miles or so belowColdfoot the Koyukuk passes for several miles in a narrow channelbetween steep rock bluffs, with here and there great detached massesstanding in the middle of the river. One has a grotesque resemblance toan aged bishop in his vestments and is known as the Bishop Rock; anothera more remote likeness to an Indian woman, and this is known as theSquaw Rock. This part of the river, which is called the cañon of theKoyukuk, though it is not a true cañon, is very picturesque, and becauseof frequent overflow, offers glare ice and swift passage to thetraveller when it does not embarrass him with running water. We werefortunate enough to pass it without getting our dogs' feet wet, and madethe half-way road-house in a brilliant moon that rendered travelling atnight pleasanter than during the day.[Sidenote: TRAVELLING AT "50 BELOW"]The next day we started again at near 50° below, but because there was agood trail and a road-house for noon, the travelling was rather pleasantthan otherwise. If there be a warm house to break the day's march andeat in, where ice-incrusted scarfs and parkees and caps and mittens maybe dried out, with a warm outhouse where the dogs may rest in comfort,travelling in such weather is not too risky or too severely trying. Thecontinual condensation of the moisture from the breath upon everythingabout the head and face is a decided inconvenience, and when itcondenses upon the eye-lashes, and the upper and the lower lashes freezetogether, the ice must be removed or it is impossible to open the eyes.This requires the momentary application of the bare hand, and every timeit goes back into the mitten it carries some moisture with it, so thatafter a while mittens are wet as well as head-gear; moreover, there isalways a certain perspiration that condenses. One gets into the habit ofturning the duffel lining of the moose-hide mitts inside out and hangingthem up the moment one gets inside a cabin. Round every road-house stovethere is a rack constructed for just that purpose.There is no more striking phenomenon of the arctic trail than thebehaviour of smoke in cold weather. As one approaches a road-house, andto greater degree a village or a town, it is seen enveloped in mist,although there be no open water to account for it, and the prospect inevery other direction be brilliantly clear. It is not mist at all; it ismerely the smoke from the stovepipes. And the explanation is simple,although not all at once arrived at. Smoke rises because it is warmerthan the air into which it is discharged; for that and no other reason.Now, when smoke is discharged into air at a temperature of 50° belowzero, it is deprived of its heat immediately and falls to the ground byits greater specific gravity. The smoke may be observed just issuingfrom the pipe, or rising but a few feet, and then curling downward to bediffused amidst the air near the ground.It was to such a smoke-enveloped inn that we pulled up to warm andrefresh ourselves and our team for the twenty miles that remained of theday's march. We had almost reached the limit of Koyukuk road-houses.Bettles being the head of navigation, and merchandise late in the seasonfinding water too shallow for transport to the diggings, there is moreor less freighting with dog teams and horses all the winter. This travelkeeps open the road-houses on the route. From an "outside" point of viewthey may appear rough and the fare coarse. The night accommodation is adouble row of bunks on each side of a long room with a great stove inthe middle. Sometimes there is straw in the bunks, sometimes spruceboughs; in the better class even sometimes hay-stuffed mattresses. Butto the weary traveller, who has battled with the storm or endured theintense cold for hours at a stretch, they are glad havens of refuge;they are often even life-saving stations.[Sidenote: METEOROLOGICAL]While we lay at the road-house the clear sky clouded and the thermometerrose. This is an unfailing sequence. Clear, bright weather is coldweather; cloudy weather is warm weather. The usual explanation, that thecloud acts as a blanket that checks the radiation of heat from theearth, is one of those explanations that do not explain. There is noheat to radiate. The cloud is a mass of moist air, which is warm air,introducing itself from some milder region. So the cloud brings theheat; and the lower layers of atmosphere extract it and therebydischarge the moisture. For an hour or two around noon the thermometerstood at -35° and there was a light fall of snow; then the skies clearedbecause they were discharged of all their moisture, and the thermometerwent down to -50° again. It is a beautifully simple process andsometimes takes place two or three times a day. Every time the skyclouds, the thermometer rises; every time the sky clears, thethermometer falls. And because the barometer gives notice of changes inthe density of the atmosphere, it is valuable in forecasting temperaturein our winters. A steady rise in the barometer means a steady fall inthe thermometer; a fall in the barometer in a time of great coldinfallibly prophesies warmer weather; even such rapid changes as the onegiven above are anticipated. So well is this established, that during"50°-below spells" at Fairbanks, impatient, weather-bound travellers andfreighters would busy the hospital telephone with inquiries about thebarometer, the hospital having the only barometer in the country.After another long, cold run, on the night of Friday, the 12th ofJanuary, we reached Bettles, the place we had planned to spend Christmasat. We were unable to stir from Bettles for two solid weeks, for duringthe whole of that time the thermometer never rose above 50° below zero.The long wait at Bettles would have been excessively tedious had it notbeen for the kind hospitality of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Grimm, theCommercial Company's agent and his wife, and this is but one of manytimes that I have been under obligation to them for cordial welcome andentertainment, for needs anticipated, and every sort of assistancegladly rendered. We had been expected many days; the Christmasfestivities with a gathering of natives of both races had come and gone;still they looked for us, for in this country one does not give a man upmerely because he is a few weeks behind time, nor hold him to accountfor unpunctuality. The natives remained for the most part, and there wasabundant opportunity of intercourse with them and some beginnings ofinstruction. As the days passed and all arrangements for our advancewere made, we chafed more and more at the delay, for it was very plainthat the prospect of visiting Point Hope grew less and less; but this isa great country for teaching patience and resignation.[Sidenote: PARASELENÆ]Some of the weather during that two weeks' wait was of quite exceptionalseverity. One night is fixed for ever in my memory. It is a very rarething for the wind to blow in the "strong cold," but that night therewas a wind at 58° below zero. And high up in the heavens was a sight Ihad never seen before. The moon, little past her full, had a great ringaround her, faintly prismatic; and equidistant from her, where a linethrough her centre parallel with the horizon would cut the ring, weretwo other moons, distinct and clear. It was a strangely beautiful thing,this sight of three moons sailing aloft through the starry sky, asthough the beholder had been suddenly translated to some planet thatenjoys a plurality of satellites, but no living being could stand longat gaze in that wind and that cold. A perfect paraselene is, I amconvinced, an extremely rare thing, much rarer than a perfect parhelion("moon-cats" my companion thought the phenomenon should be called,saving the canine simile for the sun), for in seven years' travel I havenever seen another, and the references to it in literature are few.The next day at noon, the sun not visible above the distant mountains,there appeared in the sky a great shining cross of orange light, justover the sun's position, that held and shone for nigh an hour and onlyfaded with the twilight. It is not surprising that these appearancesshould deeply impress the untutored mind and should be deemedsignificant and portentous; they must deeply impress any normal mind,they are so grand and so strange. The man who has trained his intellectuntil it is so stale, and starved his imagination until it is soshrivelled that he can gaze unmoved at such spectacles, that they areinsignificant to him, has but reduced himself to the level of the dogupon whom also they make no impression--though even a dog will howl at agreat aurora. Of course we know all about them; any schoolboy can pickup a primer of physical geography and explain the laws of refraction,and the ugly and most libellous diagram of circles and angles that showsjust how these lustrous splendours happen; but the mystery beyond is notby one hair's breadth impaired nor their influence upon the spectatordiminished. In Alaska perhaps more than any other country it is theheavens that declare the glory of God and the firmament that shows Hishandiwork, and the awestruck Indian who comes with timid inquiry of theimport of such phenomena is rightfully and scientifically answered thatthe Great Father is setting a sign in the sky that He still rules, thatHis laws and commandments shall never lose their force, whether in theheavens above or on the earth beneath.[Sidenote: THE STRONG COLD]The "strong cold" itself is an awe-inspiring thing even to those whohave been familiar with it all their lives; and a dweller in otherclimes, endowed with any imagination, may without much difficulty enterinto the feelings of one who experiences it for the first time. Itdescends upon the earth in the brief twilight and long darkness of thedead of winter with an irresistible power and an inflexible menace.Fifty below, sixty below, even seventy below, the thermometer reads.Mercury is long since frozen solid and the alcohol grows sluggish. Landand water are alike iron; utter stillness and silence usually reign.Bare the hand, and in a few minutes the fingers will turn white and befrozen to the bone. Stand still, and despite all clothing, all woollens,all furs, the body will gradually become numb and death stalk upon thescene. The strong cold brings fear with it. All devices to exclude it,to conserve the vital heat seem feeble and futile to contend with itsterrible power. It seems to hold all living things in a crushingrelentless grasp, and to tighten and tighten the grip as the temperaturefalls.Yet the very power of it, and the dread that accompanies it, give acertain fearful and romantic joy to the conquest of it. A man who hasendured it all day, who has endured it day after day, face to face withit in the open, feels himself somewhat the more man for the experience,feels himself entered the more fully into human possibilities andpowers, feels an exultation that manhood is stronger even than thestrong cold. But he is a fool if ever he grow to disdain the enemy. Itwaits, inexorable, for just such disdain, and has slain many at last whohad long and often withstood it.On those rare occasions when there is any wind, any movement of the airat all, there enters another and a different feeling. Into the menace ofa power, irresistible, inflexible, but yet insentient, there seems toenter a purposeful, vengeful evil. It pursues. The cold itself becomesmerely a condition; the wind a deadly weapon which uses that conditionto deprive its victim of all defence. The warmth which active exercisestores up, the buckler of the traveller, is borne away. His reservesare invaded, depleted, destroyed. And then the wind falls upon him withits sword. Of all of which we were to have instance here on the Koyukuk.[Sidenote: "FOUND FROZEN"]In the second week of our stay at Bettles, while Divine service was inprogress in the store building, crowded with whites and natives, thedoor opened and, with an inrush of cold air that condensed the moistureat that end of the room into a cloud and shot along the floor like steamfrom an engine exhaust, there entered an Indian covered with rime, hiswhole head-gear one mass of white frost, his snow-shoes, just removed,under his arm, and a beaded moose-skin wallet over his shoulder. Everyeye was at once turned to him as he beat the frost from his parkee hoodand thrust it back, unwrapped fold after fold of the ice-crusted scarffrom his face, and pulled off his mittens. Seeking out the agent, hemoved over to him and whispered something in his ear. It was plain thatthe errand was of moment and the message disturbing, and as I had lostthe attention of the congregation and the continuity of my owndiscourse, I drew things to a close as quickly as I decently could. ThatIndian had come seventy-five miles on snow-shoes in one run, withoutstopping at all save to eat two or three times, at a continuoustemperature of 50° below zero or lower, to bring word that he had founda white man frozen to death on the trail; and on the Koyukuk that featwill always be counted to Albert the Pilot for righteousness. From thelocation and description of the dead man, there was no difficulty inidentifying him. He was a wood-chopper under contract with the companyto cut one hundred cords of steamboat wood against next summer'snavigation at a spot about one hundred miles below Bettles. He had takendown with him on the "last water" enough grub for about three months,and was to return to Bettles for Christmas and for fresh supplies. Aftera day or two's rest the Indian was sent back with instructions to bringthe body to a native village we should visit, to whipsaw lumber for acoffin and dig a grave, and we engaged to give the body Christianburial.Uneasy at the softening muscles and sinews of this long inaction, I tooksnow-shoes and a couple of Kobuks one day and made an ascent of the hillbehind Bettles known as Lookout Mountain, because from its top the smokeof the eagerly expected first steamboat of the summer may be seen manymiles down the river; being moved to that particular excursion bydispute among the weather-bound freighters as to the hill's height.The change of temperature as we climbed the hill was striking. On thefirst shoulder we were already out of the dense atmosphere of the valleyand above the smoke gloom of the houses, and as we rose the air grewmilder and milder, until at the top we emerged into the first sunshineof many weeks and were in an altogether different climate--balmy andgrateful it was to us just come up from the strong cold. The aneroidshowed the altitude about seven hundred feet above Bettles, and Iregretted very much I had not brought the thermometer as well, for itsreading would have been most interesting.The view from the top was brilliantly clear and far-reaching. The broadplain across the river was checkered black and white with alternatingspruce thickets and lakes; beyond it and the mountains that bounded itlay the valley of the south fork which we had crossed fifty or sixtymiles farther up on our journey hither. Right in front of us the middlefork made its big bend from southwest to south, and to the left, thatis, to the north, the valley of the John River opened up its coursethrough the sharp white peaks of the Endicott Mountains. It was in thisdirection that my eyes lingered longest. I knew that sixty or seventymiles up this river we could cross the low Anaktuvak Pass into theAnaktuvak River, which flows into the Colville, and that descending theColville we could reach the shores of the Northern Ocean. It was ajourney I had wished to make--and have wished ever since. There are manybands of Esquimaux on that coast, never visited save by those who makemerchandise of them in one way or another. Please God, some day I shouldget there; meanwhile our present hopes lay west, though, indeed, thesegrew daily fainter.CHAPTER IIIBETTLES TO THE PACIFIC--THE ALATNA, KOBUK PORTAGE, KOBUK VILLAGE,KOTZEBUE SOUNDALL our preparations were long since made. Our Indian guide had beensent back to Fort Yukon from Coldfoot, and here we engaged a youngEsquimau with his dog team and sled, to go across to Kotzebue Sound withus. There was also a young Dane who wished to go from the Koyukukdiggings to the diggings at Candle Creek on the Seward Peninsula, andhim we were willing to feed in return for his assistance on the trail.The supplies had been carefully calculated for the journey, thetoboggans were already loaded, and we waited but a break in the coldweather to start.Our course from Bettles would lead us sixty-five miles farther down theKoyukuk to the mouth of the Alatna. The visit to the native village andthe burial of the poor fellow frozen to death would take us ten milesfarther down than that, and we would return to the Alatna mouth. Thenthe way would lie for fifty miles or so up that stream, and then over aportage, across to the Kobuk River, which we should descend to its mouthin Kotzebue Sound; the whole distance being about five hundred milesthrough a very little travelled country. We learned indeed, that it hadbeen travelled but once this winter, and that on the first snow. It wasthought at Bettles that we might possibly procure some supplies at anewly established mission of the Society of Friends about half-way downthe Kobuk River, but there was no certainty about it, and we must carrywith us enough man-food to take us to salt water. Our supply of dog fishwe might safely count upon replenishing from the natives on the Kobuk.Another thing that caused some thought was the supply of small money.There was no silver and no currency except large bills on the Koyukuk,and we should need money in small sums to buy fish with. So the agentweighed out a number of little packets of gold-dust carefully sealed upin stout writing-paper like medicine powders, some worth a dollar, someworth two dollars, the value written on the face, and we found themreadily accepted by the natives and very convenient. Two years later Iheard of some of those packets, unbroken, still current on the Kobuk.At last, on the 26th of January, we got away. The thermometer stood onlya few degrees above -50° when we left, but the barometer had beenfalling slowly for a couple of days, and I was convinced the cold spellwas over. With our three teams and four men we made quite a littleexpedition, but dogs and men were alike soft, and for the first two daysthe travel was laborious and slow; then came milder weather and bettergoing.[Sidenote: THE KOYUKUK "TOWNS" OF '98]We passed the two ruined huts of Peavey, the roofs crushed by thesuperincumbent snow. In the summer of 1898 a part of the stream of goldseekers, headed for the Klondike by way of Saint Michael, was deflectedto the Koyukuk River by reports of recent discoveries there. A greatmany little steamboat outfits made their way up this river late in theseason, until their excessive draught in the falling water brought themto a stand. Where they stopped they wintered, building cabins andstarting "towns." In one or two cases the "towns" were electrically litfrom the steamboat's dynamo. The next summer they all left, all savethose who were wrecked by the ice, and the "towns" were abandoned. Butthey had got upon the map through some enterprising representative ofthe land office, and they figure on some recent maps still. Peavey,Seaforth, Jimtown, Arctic City, Beaver City, Bergman, are all just namesand nothing else, though at Bergman the Commercial Company had a plantfor a while.We passed the mouth of the Alatna, where were two or three Indiancabins, and went on the remaining ten miles to Moses' Village, where thebody of the man frozen to death had been brought. Moses' Village, namedfrom the chief, was the largest native village on the Koyukuk River, andwe were glad, despite our haste, that we had gone there. The repeatedrequests from all the Indians we met for a mission and school on theKoyukuk River and the neglected condition of the people had moved me theprevious year to take up the matter. This was my first visit, however,so far down the river.We found the coffin unmade and the grave undug, and set men vigorouslyto work at both. The frozen body had been found fallen forward on handsand feet, and since to straighten it would be impossible withoutseveral days' thawing in a cabin, the coffin had to be of the size andshape of a packing-case; of course the ground for the grave had to bethawed down, for so are all graves dug in Alaska, and that is a slowbusiness. A fire is kindled on the ground, and when it has burned out,as much ground as it has thawed is dug, and then another fire iskindled. We had our own gruesome task. The body should be examined tomake legally sure that death came from natural causes. With difficultythe clothes were stripped from the poor marble corpse, my companion madethe examination, and as a notary public I swore him to a report for thenearest United States commissioner. This would furnish legal proof ofdeath were it ever required; otherwise, since there is no provision forthe travelling expenses of coroners, and the nearest was one hundred andforty or one hundred and fifty miles away, there would have been noinquest and no such proof.[Sidenote: A WILDERNESS TRAGEDY]The man had delayed his return to Bettles too long. When his food wasexhausted and he had to go, there came on that terrible cold spell. Alittle memorandum-book in his pocket told the pitiful story. Day by dayhe lingered hoping for a change, and day by day there was entry of theawful cold. He had no thermometer, but he knew the temperature was -50°or lower by the cracking noise that his breath made--the old-timer'stest. At last the grub was all gone and he must go or starve. The finalentry read: "All aboard to-morrow, hope to God I get there." The Indiansestimated that he had been walking two days, and had "siwashed it" atnight somewhere beside a fire in the open without bedding. Holes wereburned in his breeches in two places, where, doubtless, he had got toonear the fire. He had nothing whatever to eat with him save a piece ofbacon gnawed to the rind. There were only two matches in his pocket, andthey were mixed up with trash of birch-bark and tobacco, so it is likelyhe did not know he had them. He had lit all the fires he could light andeaten all the food he had to eat. Still he was plugging along towardsthe native village nine miles away. Then he lost the trail, probably inthe dark, for it was faint and much drifted, and had taken off hissnow-shoes to feel with his moccasined feet for the hardened snow thatwould indicate it. That was almost the end. He had gone across the riverand back again, feeling for the trail, and then, with the deadlynumbness already upon his brain, had wandered in a circle. The date ofhis starting in the memorandum-book and the distance travelled made italmost certain that, at some moment between the time when those threemoons floated in the sky and the time when that cross glared on thehorizon, he had fallen in the snow, never to rise again. Fifty-eightbelow zero and a wind blowing!One supposes that the actual death by freezing is painless, as it iscertainly slow and gradual. The only instance of sudden gelation I everheard of is in Longfellow's "Wreck of the Hesperus," where the skipper,having answered one question, upon being asked another,        "Answered never a word,         For a frozen corpse was he."But if the actual death be painless, the long conscious fight against itmust be an agony; for a man of any experience must realise the peril heis in. The tingling in fingers and toes and then in knees and elbows isa warning he recognises only too well. He knows that, unless he canrestore warmth by restoring the circulation, he is as good as frozenalready. He increases his pace and beats his arms against his breast.But if his vitality be too much reduced by hunger and fatigue and coldto make more than a slight response to the stimulation, if the distanceto warmth and shelter be too great for a spurt to carry him there, he issoon in worse case than before. Then the appalling prospect of perishingby the cold must rise nakedly before him. The enemy is in the breach,swarming over the ramparts, advancing to the heart of the fortress, notto be again repelled. He becomes aware that his hands and feet arealready frozen, and presently there may be a momentary terriblerecognition that his wits begin to wander. Frantically he stumbles on,thrashing his body with his arms, forcing his gait to the uttermost, aprey to the terror that hangs over him, until his growing horror anddespair are mercifully swallowed up in the somnolent torpidity thatoverwhelms him. All of us who have travelled in cold weather know howuneasy and apprehensive a man becomes when the fingers grow obstinatelycold and he realises that he is not succeeding in getting them warmagain. It is the beginning of death by freezing.We buried the body on a bench of the bluff across the river from thenative village, the natives all standing around reverently while thewords of committal were said, and set up a cross marked withlead-pencil: "R. I. P.--Eric Ericson, found frozen, January, 1906." Twoor three years later a friend sent me a small bronze tablet with thesame legend, and that was affixed to the cross. There are many suchlonely graves in Alaska, for scarce a winter passes that does not claimits victims in every section of the country. That same winter we heardof two men frozen on the Seward Peninsula, two on the Yukon, one on theTanana, and one on the Valdez trail. This day I recorded a temperatureof 10°, the first plus temperature in thirty-nine days, and thatprevious rise above zero was the first in twenty days.[Sidenote: NEGLECTED NATIVES]That night we gathered all the natives, and after long speech with poorinterpretation I ventured to promise them a mission the next year. Someof them had been across to the Yukon years before and had visited themission at Tanana. Some had been baptized there. Some had never seen aclergyman or missionary of any sort before, and had never heard thegospel preached. We were touched by one old blind woman who told of avisit to a mission on the Yukon, and how she learned to sing a hymnthere. Her son interpreted: "She say every night she sing that hymn forspeak to God." She was encouraged to sing it, and it turned out to bethe alphabet set to a tune! After much pleading and with somehesitation, I baptized seventeen children, comforting myself with theassurance of the coming mission, which would undertake their Christiantraining and instruction.Back next day at the mouth of the Alatna, I was again impressed with theeligibility of that spot as a mission site. It was but ten miles abovethe present native village, and, with church and school established, thewhole population would sooner or later move to it. This givesopportunity for regulating the building of cabins, and the advantage ofa new, clean start. Moreover, the Alatna River is the highway betweenthe Kobuk and the Koyukuk, and the Esquimaux coming over in increasingnumbers, would be served by a mission at this place as well as theIndians. I foresaw two villages, perhaps, on the opposite sides of theriver--one clustered about the church and the school, the other a littlelower down--where these ancient hereditary enemies might live side byside in peace and harmony under the firm yet gentle influence of thechurch. So I staked a mission site, and set up notices claiming groundfor that purpose, almost opposite the mouth of the Alatna, which, in thenative tongue, is Allakaket or Allachaket.[Sidenote: THE INLAND ESQUIMAUX]There was some trail up the Alatna and we made fair headway on itssurface, stopping two nights at Kobuk huts. We are out of the Indiancountry now, and shall see no more Indians until we are back on theYukon. The mode of life, the habits, the character of the races are verydifferent--the first Esquimau habitation we visited proclaiming it.These inland Esquimaux, though some of the younger ones have never seensalt water--our guide, Roxy, for one--are still essentially a salt-waterpeople. Their huts, even in the midst of trees, are half-undergroundaffairs, for they have not learned log-building; the windows are ofseal gut, and seal oil is a staple article of their diet. Their clothingis also marine, their parkees of the hair-seal and their mukluks of thegiant seal. Communications are always kept up with the coast, and thesea products required are brought across. The time for the movement ofthe Kobuks back and forth was not quite yet, though we hoped we shouldmeet some parties and get the benefit of their trail. Just before weleft the Alatna River we stopped at Roxy's fish cache and got some greenfish, hewing them out of the frozen mass with the axe. The young man hadfished here the previous summer, had cached the fish caught too late todry in the sun, and they had remained where he left them for four orfive months. Most of them had begun to decay before they froze, but thatdid not impair their value as dog food, though it rendered the cookingof them a disagreeable proceeding to white nostrils. This caching offood is a common thing amongst both natives and whites, and it is rarelythat a cache is violated except under great stress of hunger, whenviolation is recognised as legitimate. Doughty, in his _Arabia Deserta_,mentions the same custom amongst the Arabs; Sven Hedin amongst theTartars. Sparsely peopled waste countries have much the same customs allover the world. Even the outer garb in the Oriental deserts has muchresemblance to our parkee; both burnoose and parkee are primarilywindbreaks, and it makes little difference whether the wind be chargedwith snow or sand.At midday on the 3d of February we left the Alatna River and took ourway across country for the Kobuk. We had now no trail at all save whathad been made a couple of months before by the only other party that hadcrossed the portage this winter, and it was buried under fifteen orsixteen inches of snow. There was quite a grade to be climbed to reachthe plateau over which our course lay, and the men, with rope over theshoulder, had to help the dogs hauling at the sled. Indeed, over a gooddeal of this portage, from time to time, the men had to do dog work, forthe country is rolling, one ridge succeeding another, and the loose,deep snow made heavy and slow going. One man must go ahead breakingtrail, and that was generally my task, though when the route grewdoubtful and the indications too faint for white man's eye, Roxy took myplace and I took his gee pole, and slipped his rope around my chest.Breaking trail would not be so laborious if one could wear the largesnow-shoes that are used for hunting. But the hunting shoe, though itcarries the man without fatigue, does not help the dogs. The small shoeknown as the trail shoe, packs the snow beneath it, and by the time thetrail breaker has gone forward, then back again, and then forward oncemore, the snow is usually packed hard enough to give the dogs somefooting. Footing the dog must have or he cannot pull; a dog wallowing insnow to his belly cannot exert much traction on the vehicle behind him.The notion of snow-shoeing as a sport always seems strange to us on thetrail, for to us it is a laborious necessity and no sport at all. Thetrail breaker thus goes over most of the ground thrice, and when he isanxious at the same time to get a fairly accurate estimate by thepedometer of the distance travelled, he must constantly remember toupend the instrument in his pocket when he retraces his steps, andrestore it to its recording position when he attacks unbroken snowagain. Also he must take himself unawares, so to speak, from time totime, and check the length of his stride with the tape measure and alterthe step index as the varying surfaces passed over require.Conscientiously used, with due regard to its limitations, the pedometerwill give a fair approximation of the length of a journey, but a man canno more tell how far he has gone by merely hanging a pedometer in hispocket than he can tell the height above sea-level of an inland mountainby merely carrying an aneroid barometer to the top.[Sidenote: THE SUNRISE AND THE MOUNTAINS]It was on this Alatna-Kobuk portage that we saw the most magnificentsunrise any of us could remember. It had been cloudy for some days withthreat of snow which did not fall. We were camped in a little hollowbetween two ridges, and I had been busy packing up the stuff in the tentpreparatory to the start, when I stepped out with a load of bedding inmy arms, right into the midst of the spectacle. It was simple, as thegreatest things are always simple, but so gorgeous and splendid that itwas startling. The whole southeastern sky was filled with great luminousbands of alternate purple and crimson. At the horizon the bands weredeeper in tone and as they rose they grew lighter, but they maintainedan unmixed purity of contrasting colour throughout. I gazed at it untilthe tent was struck and the dogs hitched and it was time to start, andthen I had to turn my back upon it, for our course lay due west, and Iwas breaking trail. But on the crest of the rising ground ahead thereburst upon my delighted eyes a still more astonishing prospect. We werecome to the first near view of the Kobuk mountains, and the reflectedlight of that gorgeous sunrise was caught by the flanks of a group ofwild and lofty snow peaks, and they stood up incandescent, with a vividcolour that seemed to come through them as well as from them. To rightand left, mountains out of the direct path of that light gave a softdead mauve, but these favoured peaks, bathed from base to summit inclear crimson effulgence, glowed like molten metal. It was not thereflected light of the sun, but of the flaming sky, for even as Ilooked, a swift change came over them. They passed through the tones ofred to lightest pink, not fading but brightening, and before mycompanions reached me the sun's rays sprang upon the mountains from thehorizon, and they were golden.It seems almost foolish to the writer and may well seem tedious to thereader, to attempt in words the description of such scenes; yet so deepis the impression they produce, and so large the place they take in thememory, that to omit them would be to strike out much of the charm andzest of these arctic journeys. Again and again in the years that havepassed, the recollection of that pomp of colour on the way to the Kobukhas come suddenly upon me, and always with a bounding of the spirit. Ican shut my eyes now and see that incomparable sunrise; I can see againthat vision of mountains filling half the sky with their unimaginableardency, and I think that this world never presented nobler sight.Surely for its pageantry of burning, living colour, for purity and depthand intensity of tint, the Far North with its setting of snow surpassesall other regions of the earth.[Sidenote: TRAVELLING KOBUK LADS]That same day we met a couple of Kobuk youths on their way to theKoyukuk, and they gave us the greatest gift it was in the power of manto give us--a trail! There is no finer illustration of the mutualservice of man to man than the meeting of parties going opposite waysacross the unbroken snows. Each is at once conferring and receiving thegreatest of favours, without loss to himself is heaping benefit on theother; is, it may be--has often been--saving the other, and beinghimself saved. No more hunting and peering for blazes, no more castingabout hither and thither when open stretches are crossed; no more threetimes back and forth to beat the snow down--twenty miles a day insteadof ten or twelve--the boys' trail meant all that to us. And our trailmeant almost as much to them. So we were rejoiced to see them, sturdyyouths of sixteen or seventeen, making the journey all by themselves. Myheart goes out to these adventurous Kobuks, amiable, light-hearted,industrious; keen hunters, following the mountain-sheep far up where theIndian will not go; adepts in all the wilderness arts; heirs of theuncharted arctic wastes, and occupying their heritage. If I were not awhite man I would far rather be one of these nomadic inland Esquimauxthan any other native I know of.That same day we crossed two headwater forks of the Kokochatna, as theKobuks call it, or the Hogatzitna as the Koyukuks call it, or the HogRiver, as the white men call it, a tributary of the Koyukuk that comesin about one hundred and fifty miles below the Alatna. As we came down asteep descent to the little east fork, it showed so picturesque andattractive, with clumps of fine open timber on an island, that itremains in my mind one of the many places from the Grand Cañon of theColorado almost to the Grand Cañon of the Noatak, where I should like tohave a lodge in the vast wilderness.We had but crossed the west fork when we knew that we were close to thewatershed between the Kobuk and the Koyukuk, between the streams thatfall into Kotzebue Sound and those that fall by the Koyukuk and theYukon Rivers into Bering Sea; and because it seemed a capital geographicfeature, it was disappointing that it was so inconspicuous. Indeed, wewere not sure which of two ridges was the actual divide. Beyond thoseridges there was no question, for the ground sloped down to LakeNoyutak, a body of water some three and a half miles in length and ofvarying breadth that drains into the Kobuk. Here in a cabin we foundthree more young Kobuks, and spent the night, getting our first view ofthe Kobuk River next day, not from an eminence, as I had hoped, but onlyas we came down a bank through thick timber and opened suddenly upon it.By the pedometer I made the portage forty-six miles.[Sidenote: THE KOBUK RIVER]The upper Kobuk is a picturesque river, the timber being especiallylarge and handsome for interior Alaska. We reached it just above themouth of the Reed River, tributary from the north. The weather waswarm--too warm for good travelling--the thermometer standing at 15­­­°,20°, and one day even 30° above zero all day long, so that we were allbareheaded and in our shirt-sleeves. From time to time, as the course ofthe river varied, we had distant views of the rocky mountains of theEndicott Range, or, as it might be written, the Endicott Range of theRocky Mountains, for such, in fact, it is--the western and finalextension of the great American cordillera. On the other side of thosemountains was the Noatak River, flowing roughly parallel with the Kobuk,and discharging into the same arm of the sea.The division of the labour of camping amongst four gave us all someleisure at night, and I found time to read through again _The Cloisterand the Hearth_ and _Westward Ho!_ with much pleasure, quite agreeingwith Sir Walter Besant's judgment that the former is one of the besthistorical novels ever written. There are few more attractive roysterersin literature to me than Denys of Burgundy, with his "_Courage,camarades, le diable est mort!_" This matter of winter reading is adifficult one, because it is impossible to carry many books. My plan isto take two or three India-paper volumes of classics that have been readbefore, and renew my acquaintance with them. But reading by the light ofone candle, though it sufficed our forefathers, is hard on ourdegenerate eyes.The days were much lengthened now, and the worst of the winter wasdone. There would still be cold and storm, but hardly again of the sameintensity and duration. When the traveller gets well into February hefeels that the back of the winter is broken, for nothing can take fromhim the advantage of the ever-lengthening days, the ever-climbing sun.On the afternoon of the third day on the Kobuk we reached a cabinoccupied by two white men, the first we had seen since we left Bettles,and we were the first white men they had seen all the winter. They werewaiting for the spring, having a prospecting trip in view; simplyspending the winter eating up their grub. There was nothing whatever toread in the cabin, and they had been there since the freeze-up! Theywelcomed us, and we stayed overnight with them, and that night there wasa total eclipse of the moon, of which we had a fine view. We had analmanac which gave the time of totality at Sitka, and we knew theapproximate longitude of our position, so we were able to set ourwatches by it.The next two days are noted in my diary as two of the pleasantest daysof the whole journey--two of the pleasantest days I ever spent anywhere,I think. A clear, cloudless sky, brilliant sunshine, white mountainpeaks all about us, gave picture after picture, and the warm, balmy airmade travelling a delight. There are few greater pleasures than that ofpenetrating into a new country, with continually changing views ofbeauty, under kindly conditions of weather and trail. In the yellow raysof the early sun, the spruce on the river bank looked like a screen ofcarved bronze, while the slender stems of birches in front of thespruce looked like an inlaying of old ivory upon the bronze, the wholeset upon its pedestal of marble-like snow. The second day we took aportage of nine or ten miles across a barren flat and struck the riveragain just below a remarkable stretch of bank a mile or so in length,with never a tree or a bush or so much as the smallest shrub growing onit. Thick timber above suddenly ceased, thick timber below suddenlybegan again, and this bare bank reached back through open, barren flatto a low pass in the mountains. It was a bank of solid ice, so we weretold later, and I remembered to have heard of ice bluffs on the Kobuk,and wished that the portage had struck the river above this spot insteadof below it, that there might have been opportunity to examine it.[Sidenote: THE MISSION][Sidenote: ENGLISH AND ESQUIMAU]A little farther down the river and we were at the new mission of theSociety of Friends, where a cordial reception awaited us and, luxury ofluxuries, a warm bath! Again and again the wash-tub was emptied andfresh water was heated until we all had wallowed to our heart's content.The rude log buildings of the mission had been begun the previous fall,and were not yet complete, but they were advanced enough for occupation,and the work of the mission went actively on. It was in charge of ratheran extraordinary man. He gave us a sketch of his life, which was full ofinterest and matter for thought. For many years he was a police officerand jailer in the West. Then he sailed on a whaler and thus becameacquainted with the Esquimaux. He was converted from a life ofdrunkenness and debauchery--though one fancied his character was notreally ever so bad as he painted it--at a "Peniel" mission in aCalifornian town. He went in out of mere idle curiosity, just recoveredfrom a spree, and was so wrought upon that when he came out he was adifferent creature, a new man, the old life with its appetite forvicious indulgence sloughed off and left behind him, and he nowpossessed with a burning desire to do some such active service for Godas aforetime he had done for the devil. After three or four months ofsome sort of training in an institution maintained by the CaliforniaSociety of Friends--a body more like the Salvation Army, one judges,than the old Quakers--he volunteered for service at a branch which theold-established mission of the Society at the mouth of the Kobuk desiredto plant two hundred miles or so up the river, and had come out and hadplunged at once into his task. So here he was, some six or seven monthsinstalled, teacher, preacher, trader in a small way, and indefatigableworker in general. Pedagogical training or knowledge of "methods" he hadnone at all, but the root of the matter was in him, and surely never wassuch an insatiable school-teacher. Morning, noon, and night he wasteaching. While he was cooking he was hearing lessons; while he waswashing the dishes and cleaning the house he was correcting exercises insimple addition. In the schoolroom he was full of a genial enthusiasmthat seemed to impart instruction by sheer dynamic force. "Boot," thelesson book said. There was no boot in the schoolroom, all were shod inmukluks. He dives into his dwelling-house attachment and comes backholding up a boot. "Boot," he says, and "boot" they all repeat.Presently the word "tooth" was introduced in the lesson. Withdrawing aloose artificial tooth of the "pivot" variety from his upper jaw, heholds it aloft and "tooth!" he cries out, and "toot!" they all cry, andhe claps it back into his head again.We were present on Sunday at the services. There was hearty singing of"Pentecostal" hymns with catchy refrains, but we were compelled tonotice again what we had noticed amongst the little bands of thesepeople on the Koyukuk when we set them to singing, that the English wasunintelligible; and since it conveyed no meaning to us could have hadlittle for them. This is the inevitable result of ignoring the nativetongue and adopting the easy expedient of teaching the singing of hymnsand the recitation of formulas like the commandments in English. For ageneration or two, at least, the English learned, save by children at aboarding-school, where nothing but English is spoken, is fragmentary andof doubtful import in all except the commonest matters of speech. And atsuch boarding-schools there is danger of the real misfortune anddrawback of natives growing up to live their lives amongst natives,ignorant of the native tongue. There is no quick and easy way ofstamping out a language, thank God; there is no quick and easy way ofimparting instruction in a foreign language. By and by all the Alaskannatives will be more or less bilingual, but the intimate speech and themost clearly understood speech will still be the mother tongue. Thesinging done, there was preaching through an interpreter, and then eachindividual present "gave testimony," which consisted for the most partin the recitation of a text of Scripture. Then there were individualprayers by one and another of the congregation, and then some moresinging. The only hymn I could find in the book that I knew was the fineold hymn, "How Firm a Foundation," and that was sung heartily to the"Adeste Fideles." They are naturally a musical race, picking up airswith great facility, and they thoroughly enjoy singing.[Sidenote: THE "DOUBLE STANDARD"]After the service the missionary confided some of his troubles to me. Hehad lately learned through his interpreter that the burden of most ofthe individual prayers was that the supplicator might "catch plentyskins" and be more successful in hunting than his fellows; and though hehad done his best to impress upon them the superior importance of makingrequest for spiritual benefit, he was afraid they had made no change."Our people 'outside,'" he said, "don't understand these folk, and I'mnot sure that I thoroughly understand them myself." "They're all'converted,'" he said; "they all claim to have experienced a change ofheart, but some of them I know are not living like converted people, andsometimes I have my doubts about most of them." My sympathy went out tohim in his loneliness and his earnestness and his disappointments. Ipointed out that the emotional response to emotional preaching wascomparatively easy to get from any primitive people, but that to changetheir whole lives, to uproot old customs of sensual indulgence, toengraft new ideas of virtue and chastity was a long, slow processanywhere in the world. It was chiefly in the matter of sexual moralitythat his doubts and difficulties lay, and I was able to assure him thathis experience was but the common experience of all those who hadlaboured for the uplifting of savage people. Indeed, how should it beotherwise? Until quite lately there was almost promiscuous use of women.A man receiving a traveller in his dwelling overnight proffered his wifeas a part of his hospitality; the temporary interchange of wives wascommon; young men and young women gratified themselves without rebuke;children were valuable however come by, and there was no specialdistinction between legitimate and illegitimate offspring. As onereflects on these conditions and then looks back upon conditions amongstwhite people, it would seem that all the civilised races have done is toset up a double standard of sexual morality as against the singlestandard of the savage. It can hardly be claimed that the average whiteman is continent, or even much more continent than the average Esquimau,but he has forced continence upon the greater part of his women,reserving a dishonoured remnant for his own irresponsible use. And thereare signs that some of those who nowadays inveigh against the whiteman's double standard are in reality desirous of substituting, not thesingle standard of the Christian ideal, but the single standard of thesavage. In the mining camps the prostitute has a sort ofhalf-way-recognised social position, and in polite parlance is referredto as a "sporting lady"--surely the most horribly incongruous phraseever coined; she often marries a miner who will tell you that she is asgood as he is, and she is received afterwards by all but a few as a"respectable married woman."There had been some trouble of this sort at this mission. The greatnorthern gold seekers' wave of '97 and '98 threw a numerous band ofprospectors up the Kobuk as well as up the Koyukuk. The wave had recededand left on the Kobuk but one little pool behind it, a handful of menwho found something better than "pay" on the Shungnak, a few miles away.And there was much criticism of the missionary's methods amongst them.Word of the arrival of strangers had brought some of them to Long Beach,and on Sunday night I had opportunity of addressing them, with a view toenlisting their sympathy, if possible. What if mistakes were made, whatif some of the methods employed were open to question? Here was a manwho beyond doubt was earnestly labouring in the best way he knew for theimprovement of these natives. Such an effort demanded the co-operationof every right-feeling man.[Sidenote: PERSONAL CLEANLINESS]After all, however grand the physical scenery, the meteorologicalphenomena, may be, the people of any country are the most interestingthing in it, and we found these Esquimaux extraordinarily interesting.Dirty they certainly are; it is almost impossible for dwellers in thearctic regions to be clean in the winter, and the winter lasts so longthat the habit of winter becomes the habit of the year. White and nativealike accept a lower standard of personal cleanliness than is toleratedoutside. I remember asking Bishop Rowe, before I came to Alaska: "Whatdo you do about bathing when you travel in the winter?" To which hereplied laconically: "Do without." It is even so; travellers on theAlaskan trails as well as natives belong to the "great unwashed." In thevery cold weather the procuring of water in any quantity is a verydifficult thing even for house dwellers. Every drop of it has to becarried from a water-hole cut far out on the ice, up a steep grade, andthen quite a little distance back to the dwelling--for we do not builddirectly upon these eroding banks. The water-hole is continuallyfreezing up and has to be continually hewed free of ice, and as thestreams dwindle with the progress of winter, new holes must be cutfarther and farther out. On the trail, where snow must usually be meltedfor water, it is obvious that bathing is out of the question; even thewater for hands and face is sparingly doled by the cook, and two peoplewill sometimes use the same water rather than resort to the painfulthough efficient expedient of washing with snow. If this be so despitealuminum pots and a full kit of camp vessels, it is much more so withthe native, whose supply of pots and pans is very limited. I have seen awhite man melt snow in a frying-pan, wash hands and face in it, throw itout, fry bacon and beans in it, then melt more snow and wash his cup andplate in it. There is, however, this to be said anent the disuse of thebath in this country, that in cold weather most men perspire very littleindeed, and the perspiration that is exuded passes through to the outergarments and is immediately deposited upon them as frost; and there isthis further to be said about dirt in general, that one blessed propertyof the cold is to kill all odours.One grows tolerant of dirt in this country; there is no denying it, andit is well that it is so; otherwise one would be in a chronic state ofdisgust with oneself and every one else. So the dirt of the native,unless specially prominent and offensive, is accepted as a matter ofcourse and ignored. This obstacle overcome, the Esquimaux are anattractive and most interesting race, and compare to advantage with theIndians in almost every particular. They are a very industrious people.Go into an Esquimau's hut at almost any time when they are not sleeping,and you will find every individual occupied at some task. Here is a manworking in wood or bone with the ingenious tools they have evolved; hereare women working in skin or fur, and some of them are admirableneedlewomen; here, perhaps, is another woman chewing mukluks--and many awhite man who has kept his feet dry in overflow water is grateful to theteeth that do not disdain this most effective way of securing anintimate union between sole and upper. Even the children are busy: hereis a boy whittling out bow and arrow--and they do great executionamongst rabbits and ptarmigan with these weapons that entail no cost ofpowder and shot; here is a girl beating out threads from sinew with acouple of flat stones. Some of us, troubled with unconscientioustailors, wish that a law could be passed requiring all buttons to besewn on with sinew--they never come off.[Sidenote: A LIGHT-HEARTED FOLK]They are a very light-hearted people, easily amused, bubbling over withlaughter and merriment, romping and skylarking with one another at everyintermission of labour. One of my white travelling companions on thisjourney was in the habit of using a little piece of rabbit skin toprotect his nose in cold or windy weather. The care of the nose issometimes very troublesome indeed, it freezes more readily than anyother portion of the body; and a little piece of rabbit skin, moistenedand applied to the nose, will stay there and keep it warm andcomfortable all day. But it does not exactly enhance one's personalattractions.We had stopped for camp and were all together for the first time in fouror five hours, when Roxy noticed this rabbit-skin nose protector, uponwhich the breath had condensed all the afternoon until two long iciclesdepended from it, one on each side, reaching down below the mouth; andhe fell straightway into a fit of laughter that grew uncontrollable; herolled on the snow and roared. A little annoyed at this exhibition, Ispoke sharply: "What's the matter with you, Roxy; what on earth are youcutting up like that for?" Checking himself for a moment, he pointed tomy companion and said, "Alleesame _walrus_," and went off into anotherparoxysm of laughter, rolling about and roaring. At intervals all theevening he would break out again, and when we sat down to eat itovercame him once more and he rushed outside where he could give vent tohis mirth with less offence.The boy was straightforward and conscientious. We were camped overSunday once, and Roxy had noticed many marten tracks in theneighbourhood. He had brought a few traps along with him to set out aswe went and pick up on his return, and he wanted to know if I thought hemight set some that day, although it was the day of rest. Careful not tointerfere in any way with the religious instruction any native hasreceived from any source, I told him that was a matter for him to decidehimself; that each man was responsible for his own conduct. The boythought awhile--and he did not set his traps. Now that young man hadnever received any instruction at a mission; all his teaching had beenfrom other Esquimaux. This same question of working on Sunday was thecause of some of the difficulty between the missionary at Long Beach andthe miners at Shungnak. The sluicing or "cleaning-up" season is short,and mining operators generally consider that they cannot afford to losean hour of it. The Kobuks employed by these miners quit their work onSunday, and that brought the operations to a standstill. There wassomething to be said on the miners' side, but I rejoiced that theEsquimau boys showed such steadfastness to their teaching. "If youcannot use them six days in the week, if it has to be seven or none,then do as the miners on the Yukon side do, consider the countryuninhabited, and make your arrangements as though there were no Kobuks."That was my advice, and this may be read in connection with Mr.Stefanson's caustic comments on the same rigidity of observance.We left Long Beach with a grateful feeling for the hospitality withwhich we had been received and with a substantial respect for theearnest missionary effort that was being put forth there. We were ableto replenish our grub supply and also to exchange our two toboggans forone large sled, for we were out of the toboggan country again and theyhad already become a nuisance, slipping and sliding about on the trail.Our host was up early with a good breakfast for us, and speeded theparting guest, which on the trail is certainly an essential part of truehospitality, with all the honours; the natives lined up on the bank andthe younger ones running along with us for a few hundred yards.[Sidenote: THE JADE MOUNTAINS]Soon after we left the mission we went up a series of terraces to adesolate, barren, wind-swept flat, the portage across which cut off agreat bend of the river and saved us many miles of travel. To our rightrose the Jade Mountains, whence the supply of this stone which used tobe of importance for arrow-heads and other implements was obtained andcarried far and wide. A light crust on the snow broke through at everystep, though the snow was not deep enough and the ground too uneven tomake snow-shoes useful; so we all had more or less sore feet that nightwhen we regained the river and made our camp near the mouth of theAmbler, another tributary from the north.The next day was an exceedingly long, tedious day. The Kobuk River,which in its upper reaches is a very picturesque stream, began now to beas monotonous as the lower Yukon. It had grown to considerable size, andthe bends to be great curves of many miles at a stretch, one of which,a decided bend to the north of the general westerly direction of theriver, we were three full hours in passing down. It was while traversingthis bend that we witnessed a singular mirage that lent to the day allthe enlivenment it had. Before us for ten or twelve miles stretched thebroad white expanse of the river bed, shimmering in the mellow sunlight,and far beyond, remote but clear, rose the sharp white peaks of themountains that divide the almost parallel valleys of the Kobuk and theNoatak. As we travelled, these distant peaks began to take the mostfantastic shapes. They flattened into a level table-land, and then theyshot up into pinnacles and spires. Then they shrank together in themiddle and spread out on top till they looked like great domedmushrooms. Then the broad convex tops separated themselves entirely fromtheir stalk-like bases and hung detached in the sky with daylightunderneath. And then these mushroom tops stretched out laterally andthrew up peaks of their own until there were distinct duplicate ranges,one on the earth and one in the sky. It was fascinating to watch thesewhimsical vagaries of nature that went on for hours. A change in one'sown position, from erect to stooping, caused the most convulsivecontortions, and when once I lay down on the trail that I might view thescene through the lowest stratum of the agitated air, every peak shot upsuddenly far into the sky like the outspreading of one's fingers, tosubside as suddenly as I rose to my feet again. The psalmist's querycame naturally to the mind, "Why hop ye so ye hills?" and our Kobuk boyRoxy, whose enjoyment of fine landscapes and strange sights was alwaysa pleasure to witness, answered the unspoken question. "God makemountains dance because spring come," he said prettily enough.Then we crossed another portage and cut off ten miles of river by it,and when we reached the river again I wanted to stop, for it grewtowards evening and here was good camping-ground. But we had lately metsome travelling Kobuks and they had told Roxy of a cabin "just littleway" farther on, and I yielded to the rest of the company, who wouldpush on to it and thus avoid the necessity of making camp. That native"just little way" is worse than the Scotch "mile and a bittock"; indeed,the natives have poor notion of distance in general, and miles have asvague meaning to them as kilometres have to the average Anglo-Saxon.[Sidenote: A BELATED CAMP]On and on we pushed, mile after mile, and still no cabin. In thegathering dusk we would continually think we saw it; half-fallen treesor sloping branches simulating snow-covered gables. At last it grewquite dark, and when there was general agreement that we must seek thecabin no longer, but camp, there was no place to camp in. Either thebank was inaccessible or there was lack of dry timber. We went on thus,seeking rest and finding none, until seven-thirty, and then made camp bycandle-light, in a poor place at that, having trudged thirty-five milesthat day. A night-made camp is always an uncomfortable camp, and anuncomfortable camp means a miserable night, which to-morrow must payfor. We did not get to bed till nearly midnight, and it wasnine-forty-five when we started out next morning, and we made onlyfifteen miles that day.The Kobuk valley continued to open out wider and wider and the mountainsright and left to recede. The Jade Mountains were now dim and distantbehind us, and new ranges were coming into view. The people on thislower river are very few. It was just about one hundred miles from LongBeach when we reached the next native village, a miserable collection ofpole dwellings, half underground, with perhaps a score of inhabitants.Certainly the conditions of life deteriorated as we descended thisriver. The country seems to afford nothing but fish; we were amongst theichthyophagi pure and simple. Roxy, bred and born on the upper Kobuk andnever so far down before, is very scornful about it. "Me no likee thiscountry," he says; "no caribou, no ptarmigan, no rabbits, no timber, nonothin'." The weather had grown raw and cold again, with a constantdisagreeable wind that took all the fun out of travelling. We passed aplace where a white man was pessimistically picking away at a vein ofcoal in the river bluff. "Yes, we been here all winter," he said,"working on the blamed ledge. I always knowed it was goin' to pinch out,and now it's begun to pinch. My partner's gone to Candle for more grub,but I told him it weren't no use. It's pinchin' out right now. I knowedit afore we started work, but the blamed fool wouldn't listen to me.'It'll pinch out,' I told him a dozen times; 'you mark my word it'llpinch out,' I told him, and now it's begun to pinch; and I hope he'll besatisfied." We were reminded of the many coal-mines from time to timelocated on the Yukon, in all or nearly all of which the vein has"pinched out." The deposits on the coast may be all the fancy of themagazine writer paints, and may hold the "incalculable wealth" that isattributed to them, but the coal on the interior rivers seems in scantmeasure and of inferior quality.The same night we reached the native village at the mouth of theSquirrel River, another northern tributary--the Kobuk receives most ofits waters from the north--and we spent the night and the next day,which was Sunday, in one of the half-underground huts of the place, incompany with twelve other people. Here we found Roxy's brother, dubbed"Napoleon" by some white man. They had not seen one another for years,yet all the greeting was a mutual grunt. The Kobuks are notdemonstrative in their affections, but it would not be right to concludethe affection lacking. I have seen an old Esquimau woman taking part ina dance the night after her husband was buried, yet it would have beenunjust to have concluded that she was callous and indifferent. It isvery easy to misunderstand a strange people, and very hard to understandthem thoroughly.[Sidenote: THE CANINE INTRUDER]The roof of the tent was dome-shaped and it was lit by a seal-gutskylight. In the morning while I was conducting Divine service andattempting most lamely by the mouth of a poor interpreter to convey someinstruction, a dog fight outside adjourned to the roof and presentlyboth combatants came tumbling through the gut window into the midst ofthe congregation. They were unceremoniously picked up and flung out ofthe door, a few stitches with a needleful of sinew repaired the window,and the proceedings were resumed. These gut windows have theirconvenience as well as their inconvenience. When the hut gets too warmand close even for Esquimaux, the seal gut is folded back and the outerair rushes in to the great refreshment of the occupants; when the hut iscool enough the gut is replaced. A skylight is far and away the bestmethod of illuminating any single-story structure, and this membrane isremarkably translucent, while the snow that falls or frost that formsupon such a skylight is quickly removed by beating the hand upon thedrum-like surface. All glass windows must be double glazed, or else inthe very cold weather they are quickly covered with a thick deposit offrost from the condensation of the moisture inside the room, and thenthey admit much less light than gut does. One of its unpleasant featuresis the way the membrane snaps back and forth with a report like a pistolwhenever the door is opened and shut, but on the whole it is a very goodsubstitute for glass indeed.[Sidenote: SLEEPING CUSTOMS]These river Esquimaux vary greatly in physical appearance. While many ofthem are somewhat undersized and all have small feet and hands, some arewell-developed specimens of manhood. "Riley Jim," the chief of thistribe, would be counted a tall, stalwart man anywhere. And while manyhave coarse, squat features, here and there is one who is decidedlyattractive in appearance. A sweet smile which is often upon the face,and small, regular white teeth, greatly help to redeem any countenance.A youth of about eighteen at the Squirrel River would properly be calledhandsome, one thinks--though amongst native people one grows a littleafraid of forgetting standards of comparison; and his wife--for he wasalready a husband--was a decidedly pretty girl. A word ought to be saidwhich applies to all the Esquimaux we met. Although many people live inone hut and there is no possible privacy, yet we saw no immodesty of anysort. They sleep entirely nude--probably our own great-grandparents didthe same, at least the people of Defoe and Smollet did, for nightshirtsand pyjamas are very modern things. There is much to be said from anhygienic point of view in favour of that custom as against turning in"all standing" as the Indian generally does, or sleeping in the dayunderwear as most white men do. But although every one of a dozen peoplein cabin after cabin that we stayed at on the Kobuk River above andbelow this place, of both sexes and all ages, would thus stripcompletely and go to bed, there was never any exposure of the body atall. It may be, of course, that our presence imposed a greater care inthis respect, but it did not so impress us; it seemed the normal thing.Another noticeable feature of the lives of all these people was theirdevoutness in the matter of thanks before and after meat. Some of themwould not so much as give and receive a drink of cold water without along responsive grace.As we went on down the river the country grew bleaker and drearier andthe few scattered inhabitants were living more and more the life of theseacoast. The dwellings resembled igloos more than cabins, beingcompletely covered with snow and approached by underground passages,with heavy flaps of untanned sealskin to close them. When we passed afork of the river we knew that we were entering the delta of the Kobuk,and that another day would take us to the mission on Kotzebue Sound. Itwas a long, hard day, in which we made forty miles, but an interestingone. With a start at six, we were at the mouth by nine-thirty. Thespruce which had for some time been dwarfing and dwindling gave place towillows, the willows shrank to shrubs, the shrubs changed to coarsegrass thrusting yellow tassels through the snow. The river banks sankand flattened out and ceased, and we were on Hotham Inlet with the longcoast-line of the peninsula that forms it stretching away north andsouth in the distance. Roxy's bewilderment was amusing. He stopped andgazed about him and said: "Kobuk River all pechuk!" ("Pechuk" means"played out.") "What's the matter, no more Kobuk River?" I think hismind had never really entertained the notion of the river ending, thoughof course he must often have heard of its mouth in the salt water. Hewas out of his country, his bearings all gone, a feeling of helplessinsecurity taking the place of his usual confidence, and I think he saidno more all that day.We had to traverse the ice of Hotham Inlet northward to its mouth,double the end of the peninsula, and then travel south along the coastto the mission at Kikitaruk, the peninsula being too rugged to cross.Three considerable rivers drain into Hotham Inlet, roughly parallel intheir east and west courses, the Noatak, the Kobuk, and the Selawik, sothat its waters must be commonly more fresh than salt, for its boundsare narrow and the extensive delta of its eastern shore would argue itsdepth slight. Ahead of us, as we travelled north making a bee-line forthe end of the peninsula, all the afternoon, loomed the rocky promontoryof Krusenstern, one of Kotzebue's capes, and far beyond, stretching upthe dim coast-line, lay the way to Point Hope. It was with a sinking ofthe heart that I gazed upon it, for I knew already, though I had notannounced a decision, that the road to Point Hope could not be my roadthat year. All day long the thermometer stood between -40° and -30°, andthe constant light sea-breeze kept scarfs wrapped closely about mouthsand noses, which always means disagreeable travel. When the companystopped at noon to eat a little frozen lunch, I was too chilly to ceasemy movement and pressed on. The day of that blessed comfort of thetrail, the thermos flask, was not yet. By two-thirty we had reached PipeSpit, which still further contracts the narrow entrance of the inlet,and turning west for a mile or two rounded the point and then turnedsouth for ten miles along the coast. Just about dark we reached themission and stood gazing out over the rough ice of Kotzebue Sound to theArctic Ocean, having made the forty miles in ten and a half hours. Wehad come about one thousand miles from Fairbanks, all of it on foot andmost of it on snow-shoes.[Sidenote: THE ARCTIC OCEAN]So here was my first sight of the Arctic Ocean. All day long I hadanticipated it, and it stirred me,--a dim, grey expanse stretching vastand vague in the dusk of the evening. The old navigators whose stories Ihad read as a boy passed before me in their wonderful, bold sailingvessels, going in and out uncharted waters that steamships will notventure to-day--Kotzebue, Beechey, Collinson, McClure--pushingresolutely northward.Less happy had been my first sight of the Pacific Ocean, five yearsbefore. I had the ill luck to come upon it by way of that Western ConeyIsland, Santa Monica, and from the merry-go-rounds and cheap eatingplaces Balboa and Magellan and Franky Drake fled away incontinent andwould not be conjured back; though, indeed, the original discovererswould have had yet further occasion to gaze at one another "with a wildsurmise" if they had seen shrieking companies "shooting the chutes." Buthere was vastness, here was desolation, here was silence; jagged icemasses in the foreground and boundless expanse beyond, solemn andmysterious. The Arctic Ocean was even as I had pictured it.The missionary in charge at Kikitaruk had been informed by letter of ourprojected journey during the previous summer and had long expected us.We were received with kindness and hospitality, and after supper beganat once our acquaintance with his work, for there was a service thatnight which it was thought we should attend. I spoke for a few minutesthrough an excellent interpreter and then spent a couple of hoursnodding over the stove, overcome with sleep, while there was muchsinging and "testimony."[Sidenote: TOTAL-ABSTINENCE ESQUIMAUX]The Californian Society of Friends, established here a number of yearswith branches at other points on Kotzebue Sound, has done an excellentwork amongst the Esquimaux. If they had accomplished nothing else itwould stand to the everlasting credit of the Society's missionaries thatthey have succeeded in imbuing the natives under their charge with atotal aversion to all intoxicating liquor. We had come down from theremotest points to which the influence of these people has extended; wehad met their natives five hundred miles away from their base ofinstruction, and everywhere we found the same thing. It was said by thewhite men on the Koyukuk that a Kobuk could not be induced to take adrink of whisky. It seemed to us a pity that the force of this mostwholesome doctrine should be weakened by the unsuccessful attempt toinclude tobacco in the same rigorous prohibition. In several cabinswhere we stayed there was no sign of smoking until members of our partyproduced pipes, whereupon other pipes were furtively produced and thetobacco that was offered was eagerly accepted. From any rational pointof view the putting of whisky and tobacco in the same category is surelya folly. There can be few more harmless indulgences to the native thanhis pipe, and no one knows the solace of the pipe until he has smoked itaround the camp-fire in the arctic regions after a hard day's journey.The decision to turn my back on Point Hope was, I think, the mostpainful decision I ever made in my life; with all my heart I wanted togo on. It was only one hundred and sixty or one hundred and seventymiles away. The journey had been made in three or four days; but wewere now come to a country where travel is impossible in bad weather andwhere bad weather prevails; and that journey might quite as likely taketwo weeks. I worked over the calendar in my diary, figuring how manydays of travel still remained, allowing reasonable margins, and I couldnot see that I had much more than time to get back to Fairbanks beforethe break-up, which for sufficient reason I regarded as my first duty.The day of rest at Kikitaruk was Washington's birthday, the 22d ofFebruary. Eight weeks would bring us to the 19th April, by which timethe trails would be already breaking up. Counting out Sundays, that leftforty-eight days of travelling with something like twelve hundred milesyet to make without going to Point Hope--an average of about twenty-fivemiles a day. I knew that we had made no such average in the distancealready covered, and though I knew also that travelling improvedgenerally as the season advanced, I did not know how very much bettergoing there is on the wind-hardened snows of the coast when travellingis possible at all. Again and again I have regretted that I did not takethe chance and push on, but at the time I decided as I thought I oughtto decide, and one has no real compunctions when that is the case.[Sidenote: THE RESOLUTION TO TURN SOUTH]So a first-hand knowledge of our own most interesting work among theEsquimaux was not for me on that occasion--and there has arisen noopportunity since. Mr. Knapp, who had planned to spend the rest of thewinter at Point Hope, would get a guide and a team here and turn northafter some days' rest, while I would turn south. Roxy was impatient toreturn to Bettles. "Me no likee this country," was all that could be gotout of him. So I paid him his money and made him a present of the .22repeating rifle with which he had killed so many ptarmigan on thejourney, outfitted him with clothes, grub, and ammunition, and let himgo; saying good-bye with regret, for he was a good boy to us all theway.It was late on the night of our single day of rest when I got to bed,for there had been squaring up of accounts and much writing, and when Iwent to bed I did not sleep. Again and again I reviewed the decision Ihad come to and fought against it, though such is far from my commonhabit. Even as I write, years after, the bitter rebellious reluctancewith which I turned south comes back to me. I wished the hospital atFairbanks at the bottom of the deep blue sea. I protested I would go onand complete my journey, even though it involved "thawing out" at Tananaand getting to Fairbanks on a steamboat in the summer. I had a freehand, a kindly and complaisant bishop, and none would call me strictlyto account. Then I realised that it was merely pride of purpose,self-willed resolution of accomplishing what had been essayed--in aword, personal gratification for which I was fighting, and with thatrealisation came surrender and sleep.CHAPTER IVTHE SEWARD PENINSULA--CANDLE CREEK, COUNCIL, AND NOMEONE day's rest was not a great deal after the distance we had come--andthat day fully occupied with business--but since Point Hope wasabandoned some sort of schedule must be made for the Seward Peninsula,and where Sunday shall be spent is always an important factor inarranging these itineraries. There was just time to reach Candle for thenext Sunday and it was decided to attempt it. Hans would accompany me asfar as Candle, where he hoped to find work. It meant two days offorty-five miles each, for it is ninety miles from Kikitaruk to Candle,but they told us it could be done.So the reluctant adieus made, letters despatched, some mailed here atKikitaruk, some to be carried back to Bettles and mailed there--theselatter getting outside long before the former--we started at seven inthe morning instead of six, as we had planned, on the journey down theshore of Kotzebue Sound. That hour's delay turned out to be a calamityfor us.The trail was smooth along the beach until Cape Blossom was reached, andI had the first riding of the winter, Hans and I alternately running andjumping on the sled. There was a portage across the cape, and three orfour miles below it was the wreck of the river steamer _Riley_, whichused to make a voyage up the Kobuk with supplies for the miners at theShungnak. The thermometer was at -38° when we started, and the samelight but keen breeze was blowing that had annoyed us on the other sideof the peninsula. What a barren, desolate region it is!--low rockssinking away to the dead level of the snow-field on the one hand,nothing but the ice-field on the other.[Sidenote: A BAD NIGHT][Sidenote: CAMPED IN THE OPEN]We were bound for an igloo forty-five miles from the mission, the onlyshelter between Kikitaruk on the peninsula and Kewalik on the mainland,and we had been warned that the igloo would be easy to miss if it grewdark as it would be almost indistinguishable from the snow-drifts of theshore. Some directions from a multitude of counsellors remembered in onesense by Hans and in another by me, added to our uncertainty as to justwhere the igloo lay. The wind increased in force as the evening advancedand the last time I looked at the thermometer it still registered -38°.The sun set over the sound with another of those curious distortionswhich had before proved ominous to us. It was flattened and swollen outlike a pot-bellied Chinese lantern, with a neck to it and an irregularveining over its surface that completed the resemblance. The windincreased until the air was full of flying snow and it grew dark, andstill there was no sign of the igloo. Only slowly and with muchdifficulty could the trail be followed, and that meant we were soon notmoving fast enough to keep warm in the fierce wind. At last we lost thetrail altogether, and sometimes we found ourselves out on the rough iceof the sound and sometimes wallowing in a fresh snow-drift on the shore.I became possessed with the fear that we had passed the igloo. I waspositive that we were told at the mission that we should reach it_before_ the high bluffs were passed, and we had passed them a long wayand had now but a shallow shelf to mark the coast-line. It is strangehow long that delusion about passing his destination will pursue theAlaskan traveller. Presently the dogs dropped off a steep bank in thedark, and only by good fortune we were able to keep the heavy sled fromfalling upon them, for they were dead tired and lay where they dropped.With freezing fingers I unhitched the dogs while Hans held the sled, andwe lowered it safely down. But it was plain that it was dangerous toproceed. We could not find the trail again and were growing alarminglycold. We were "up against it," as they say here, "up against it good andstrong." We had a tent but no means of putting it up, a stove butnothing to burn in it, a grub box full of food but no way to cook it. Sothe first night of coast travel was to show us the full rigour andinhospitality of the coast and to make us long for the interior again.Wood can almost always be found there within a few miles, if it be notimmediately at hand, and no one properly appreciates the hospitality ofa clump of spruce-trees until he has spent a night of storm lying out onthis barren coast. We turned the dogs loose and threw them a fishapiece, unlashed the sled, and got out our bedding. I had been sleepingin robes, Hans in a shedding caribou-hide sleeping-bag that was my petaversion. When he crawled out in the morning he was so covered with hairthat he looked like a caribou, and the miserable hairs were alwaysgetting into the food. We fished them out of the coffee, pulled them outof the butter, and picked them out of the bread. But now in thatsleeping-bag he had an enormous advantage. We lay side by side on thesnow in the lee of the sled, and, tuck myself up with blanket and robeas I would, it was impossible to keep the swirling snow from coming in.I called the dogs to me and made them lie on my feet and up against myside, and so long as they lay still I could get a little warmth, butwhenever they rose and left me I grew numb again. But Hans in hissleeping-bag was snoring. The bag is the only bedding on the coast.Added to the physical discomfort of that sleepless, shivery night wassome mental uneasiness. There was no telling to what height the stormmight rise, nor how long it might continue. Sometimes travellersovertaken in this way on the coast have to lie in their sleeping-bagsfor three days and nights before they can resume their journey. The onlyinterest the night held was the thought that came to me that as nearlyas I could tell we camped exactly on the Arctic Circle. The long nightdragged its slow length to the dawn at last and the wind moderated alittle at the same time, so with the first streak in the east I awokeHans, we gathered our poor dogs together, rolled up the snow-incrustedbedding, and resumed our journey. Two miles farther on was the igloo!Our calls awoke some one and we were bidden to enter. Descending aladder and crawling through a dark passage we came in to the gratefulwarmth and shelter. The chamber was crowded with sleeping Esquimaux andreeked with seal oil and fish, but Hans said it "looked good and smelledgood to him," and so it did to me also. One has to lie out on that coastin a storm to appreciate the value of mere shelter. We went at once tocooking, for we had eaten nothing but a doughnut or two in twenty-fourhours, and surely never meal was more relished than the reindeer steaksand the coffee we took amongst those still sleeping Esquimaux. I shouldhave liked to spend the day and the next night there, for they werefriendly and kindly, but the wind had moderated somewhat and there wasstill a chance to reach Candle for Sunday. With the offer of a sack offlour at Kewalik we induced a couple of Esquimaux to accompany us, for Iknew we had to cross the mouth of a bay over the ice to reach themainland and I wanted to take no more chances.Our company, again raised to four, started out about nine, and until theChoris Peninsula was reached the trail still skirted the shore. It isstrange that Kotzebue, who named this peninsula of a peninsula for theartist who accompanied his expedition in 1816, should have left the mainpeninsula itself unnamed, and that the British expedition which namedCape Blossom ten years later should have failed to supply the omission.It still bears no name on the map. We portaged across the ChorisPeninsula and at the end of the portage took a straight course acrossthe mouth of Escholtz Bay (Escholtz was Kotzebue's surgeon) for Kewalikon the mainland, passing Chamisso Island, named for Kotzebue's poetfriend. There is something very interesting to me in this voyage ofKotzebue's, and I have long wished to come across a full narrative ofit. But the bitter wind that swept across that ice-sheet with thethermometer at -30° brought one's thoughts back to one's own condition.My hands I could not keep warm with the gear that had sufficed for 50°and 60° below in the interior, and I was very glad to procure from oneof our native companions a pair of caribou mitts with the hair inside,an almost invulnerable gauntlet against cold. If that wind had been inour faces instead of on our sides I am sure we could not have travelledat all. At last we won across the ice and brought up at a comfortableroad-house at Kewalik, about ten miles from Candle. Here we layovernight, taking the opportunity of thawing out and drying thefrost-crusted bedding, leaving the short run into town for the morning.[Sidenote: CANDLE CREEK]The diggings on Candle Creek yield to the Koyukuk diggings only as themost northerly gold mining in the world. Although the general methodsare the same in all Alaskan camps, local circumstances introduce manydifferences. In all Alaskan camps the ground is frozen and must bethawed down. The timber of the interior renders wood the natural fuelfor the production of the steam that thaws the ground, but the scarcityof wood on the Seward Peninsula substitutes coal. There is coal on thepeninsula itself, but of very inferior quality, mixed with ice. One maysee chunks of coal with veins of ice running through them thrown uponthe fire. The wood of the interior is a great factor in its commercialand domestic economy, and its absence on the Seward Peninsula makesgreat change not only in the natural aspect of the country but in thewhole aspect of its industrial and domestic life also. Wood-chopping forthe stove and the mill, wood-sawing, wood-hauling employ no smallpercentage of all the white men in the interior--occupations which donot exist at all on the peninsula. But its encompassment by the sea, itspeninsularity, is the dominating difference between the Seward Peninsulaand the interior, and does indeed make a different country of italtogether. All prices are very much lower on the peninsula becauseships can bring merchandise directly from the "outside." Thus amongstthose who have money to spend there is a more lavish scale of livingthan in the interior towns, and luxuries may be enjoyed here that areout of the question there. Perhaps, conversely, it is true that life onthe peninsula is somewhat harder for the poorer class. Whether a railwayfrom salt water to the mid-Yukon would redress this great difference inthe cost of everything may be doubted. Railways do not usually operateat less than water-rates. There will probably always be an advantage inthe cost of living and mining in favour of the Seward Peninsula camps.There had been no public religious service of any sort in Candle, withits several hundreds of population, in three years, so there was specialsatisfaction in having reached the place for Sunday when many minerswere in town from the creeks, and an overflowing congregation wasreadily assembled. And there was great pleasure in three days' rest atthe hospitable home of a friend while the temperature remained below-40°, exacerbated by a wind that rendered travelling dangerous.Moreover, by waiting I had company on the way, and now that I waswithout native attendant or white companion, and disposed, if possible,to make the journey right across the peninsula to Council and then toNome without engaging fresh assistance, I was doubly glad of theopportunity of travelling with two men bound for the same places andacquainted with the route.[Sidenote: THE SEWARD PENINSULA]Travelling, like so many other things, is very different on the SewardPeninsula. The constant winds beat down and harden the snow until it hasa crust that will carry a man anywhere. There are only two means bywhich snow becomes crusted; one is this packing and solidifying by thewind, and the other is thawing and freezing again. There is much lesswind in the interior than on the coast, and usually much less snowfall,and the greater part of the surface of the country is protected bytrees; the climate, being continental instead of marine, is not subjectto such great fluctuations of temperature. A thaw sufficientlypronounced or sufficiently prolonged to put a stout crust on the snowwhen freezing is resumed, is a very rare thing in the interior and acommon thing on the coast. So a striking difference in travel at oncemanifests itself; in the interior all the snow is soft except on abeaten trail itself, while in the Seward Peninsula all the snow is alikehard. The musher is not confined to trails--he can go where he pleases;and his vehicle is under no necessity of conforming in width to ageneral usage of the country--it may be as wide as he pleases. Hence thehitching of dogs two and three abreast; hence the sleds of twenty-two,twenty-four, or twenty-six inches in width. My tandem rig aroused thecuriosity of those who saw it. Hence many other differences also.Hitherto we had not dreamed of watering the dogs since snow fell; now Ifound their mouths bloody from their ineffectual attempts to dig up thehard snow with their teeth, and had to water them night and morning. Itis not the custom on the Seward Peninsula to cook for the dogs, and dogmushers there argue the needlessness of that trouble. But the truereason is other and obvious. It is difficult for the traveller to getenough wood to cook for himself, let alone the dogs. On the SewardPeninsula skis are extensively used when there is soft snow; theprevalence of brush almost everywhere in the interior renders them oflittle use--and they are, therefore, little used, snow-shoes beinguniversal.So, as in nearly all such matters everywhere, local peculiarities, localdifferences, local customs, usually arise from local conditions, and thewise man will commonly conform so soon as he discovers them. There isalmost always a sufficient reason for them.[Sidenote: A "SIDLING" TRAIL]The journey from Candle to Council was a surprisingly swift one. Wecovered the one hundred and thirty miles in three days, far and away thebest travelling of the winter so far, but the usual time, I found. Thehard snow gives smooth passage though the interior of the peninsula isrugged and mountainous; two prominent elevations, the Ass's Ears,standing up as landmarks during the first day of the journey. The routecrossed ridge after ridge with steep grades, and the handling of theheavy sled alone was too much for me. Again and again it was overturned,and it was all that I could do, and more than I ought to have done, toset it up again. The wind continued to blow with violence, and shelterfrom it there was none. One hillside struggle I shall always remember.The trail sloped with the hill and the wind was blowing directly downit. I could keep no footing on the marble snow and had fallen heavilyagain and again, in my frantic efforts to hold sled and dogs and allfrom sweeping down into a dark ravine that loomed below, when Ibethought me of the "creepers" in the hind-sack, used on the rivers inpassing over glare ice. With these irons strapped to my feet I was ableto stand upright, but it was only by a hair's breadth once and againthat I got my load safely across. When I was wallowing in a hot bath atCouncil two days later I found that my hip and thigh were black and bluewhere I had fallen, though at the time, in my anxiety to save the dogsand the sled, I had not noticed that I had bruised myself. So, judginggreat things by little, one understands how a soldier may be sorelywounded without knowing it in the heat and exaltation of battle.Then for a while there would be such travel as one sees in thechildren's picture-books, where the man sits in the sled and cracks hiswhip and is whisked along as gaily as you please--such travel as I hadnever had before; but there was no pleasure in it--the wind saw tothat.On the second day we crossed "Death Valley," so called because two menwere once found frozen in it; a bleak, barren expanse, five or six milesacross, with a great gale blowing right down it, charged not only withparticles of hard snow but with spicules of ice and grains of sand. Ourcourse was south and the gale blew from the northwest, and the rightside of one's body and the right arm were continually numb from theincessant beating of the wind. The parkee hood had to be drawn closelyall the time, and the eyes were sore from trying to peer ahead throughthe fur edging of the hood. One grows to hate that wind with somethinglike a personal animosity, so brutal, so malicious does it seem. Anincautious turn of the head and the scarf that protected mouth and nosewas snatched from me and borne far away in an instant, beyond thought ofrecovery. It seems to lie in wait, and one fancies a fresh shrill ofglee in its note at every new discomfiture it can inflict. There isnothing far-fetched in the native superstition that puts a malignantspirit in the wind; it is the most natural feeling in the world. I saidso that night in camp, and one of my companions mentioned somethingabout "rude Boreas," and I laughed. The gentle myths of Greece do notfit this country. The Indian name means "the wind beast," and isappropriate.A savage, forbidding country, this whole interior of the SewardPeninsula, uninhabited and unfit for habitation; a country of naked rockand bare hillside and desolate, barren valley, without amenities of anykind and cursed with a perpetual icy blast.[Sidenote: DEATH VALLEY]The valley crossed and its ridge surmounted, a still more heart-breakingexperience was in store. We descended the frozen bed of a creek fromwhich the wind had swept every trace of snow so that the ice waspolished as smooth as glass. The dogs could get no footing and werecontinually down on their bellies, moving their legs instinctively buthelplessly, like the flippers of a turtle, while the wind carried dogsand sled where it pleased. The grade was considerable and in bends thecreek spread out wide. Nothing but the creepers enabled a man to standat all, and creepers and brake together could not hold the sled fromcareering sideways across the ice, dragging the dogs with it, until therunners struck some pebble or twig frozen in the ice and the sled wouldbe violently overturned. Twice with freezing fingers I unlashed thatsled lying on its side, and took out nearly all the load before I couldsucceed in getting it upright again, losing some of the lighter articleseach time. The third time was the worst of all. The brake had beenlittle more than a pivot on which sled and dogs were swung to leeward,but now the teeth had become so blunt that, though I stood upon it withall my weight, it would not hold at all nor check the sideways motionunder the impulse of the wind. Right across the creek we went, draggingthe dogs behind, jerking them hither and thither over the glassysurface. I saw the rocks towards which we were driving, but waspowerless to avert the disaster, and hung on in some hope, I suppose, ofbeing able to minimise it, till, with a crash that broke two of theuprights and threw me so hard that I skinned my elbow and hurt my head,we were once more overturned. Never since I reached manhood, I think,did I feel so much like sitting down and crying. It seemed hopeless tothink about getting down that creek until the wind stopped, and onedoubts if the wind ever does stop in that country. But there was no goodsitting there like a shipwrecked mariner, nursing sores and misfortunes;presently one would begin to feel sorry for oneself--that last resort ofincompetence. And the bitter wind is a great stimulus. It will notpermit inaction. So I was up again, fumbling at the sled lashings asbest I could with torpid fingers, when one of my companions, uneasy atmy delay, very kindly made his way back, and with his assistance I wasable to get the sled upright again without unloading and hold itsomewhat better on its course until another bend or two brought us tothe partial shelter of bluffs and, a little farther, to the cabin wherewe were to spend the night. I understood now why my companions had asort of hinged knife-edge fastened to one runner of their sled. By thepressure of a foot the knife-edge engaged the ice and held the sled onits course. This is another Seward Peninsula device.[Sidenote: THE KINDLY SWEDE]I have it in my diary that "a Swede named Petersen was very kind to usat the cabin, cooking for us and giving us cooked dog feed." BlessedSwede named Petersen!--there are hundreds of them in Alaska--and I shallnever forget that particular one's kindness--the only man I met in theSeward Peninsula who still persisted in cooking dog feed whenever hecould. He had cooked up a mess of rice and fish enough to last his threeor four dogs several days while he sojourned at this cabin, and he gaveit all to us and would take nothing for it. His language was whatTruthful James calls "frequent and painful and free." I ignored it for awhile, loath to take exception to anything a man said who had been sokind. But at last I could stand it no longer--it took all the savour outof his hospitality--and I said: "I hope you won't mind my saying it, forI'd hate to give offence to a man who has been so good to strangers asyou have, but I wish you'd cut out that cursing; it hurts my ears." Hesat silent a moment looking straight at me, and I was not sure how hehad taken it. Then he said: "Maybe you been kinder to me saying that,than I been to you. That's the first time I ever been call down forcursin'. I don't mean nothin' by it; it's just foolishness and I goin'try to cut it out."The dogs had done but ill on the dry fish, accustomed as they were tocooked food, and they ate ravenously of their supper. Only the previousnight Lingo had betrayed his trust for the first and last time. Comingout of the cabin just before turning in, to take a last look round, Isaw Lingo on top of the sled eating something, and I found that he haddug a slab of bacon out of the unlashed load and had eaten most of it. Iknew he was hungry, missing the filling, satisfying mess he was used to,and I did not thrash him, I simply said, "Oh, Lingo!" and the dog gotoff the sled and slunk away, the very picture of conscious, shamefacedguilt. That was the only time he did such a thing in all the six years Idrove him.Council was past its prime at the time of this visit, but just as weentered the town, at the end of the third day's run, it seemed in dangerof going through all the stages of decadence with a rush to totaldestruction out of hand, for a fire had broken out in a laundry, andwith the high wind still blowing it looked as though every building wasdoomed. Of two chemical engines possessed by the town one refused towork, but the vigour and promptness of the people in forming two linesdown to the river, and passing buckets with the utmost rapidity, copedwith the outbreak just in time to prevent its spreading beyond allcontrol. Tired as we were, we all pitched in and passed buckets untilparkees and mitts and mukluks were incrusted with ice from water thatwas spilled. Efficient protection is a matter of great difficulty andexpense in Alaskan towns, and there is not one of them that has escapedbeing swept by fire. The buildings are almost necessarily all of wood,the cost of brick and stone construction being prohibitive. No one canguarantee ten years of life to a placer-mining town, and there would beno warrant for the expenditure of the sums required for fireproofbuilding even were the capital available. But the rapidity with whichthey are rebuilt, where rebuilding is justified, is even more remarkablethan the rapidity with which they are destroyed.A Saturday and Sunday were very welcome at Council, and the courtesy ofthe Presbyterian minister, who gave up his church and his congregationsto me, Esquimaux in the morning and white at night, was muchappreciated.[Sidenote: NORTON SOUND]In warmer weather, the thermometer no lower than -5° at the start, butwith the same gale blowing that had blown ever since we left Candle,though it had shifted towards the northeast, we got away on Mondaymorning, bound for Nome, ninety miles away, hoping to reach the half-wayhouse that night. Five or six hours' run over good trails, with nogreater inconvenience than the acceleration of our pace by the wind ondown grades, until the sled frequently overran the dogs withentanglements and spillings, brought us to the seacoast at Topkok, and anoble view opened up as we climbed the great bluff. There Norton Soundspread out before us, its ice largely cleared away and blown into BeringSea by the strong wind that had prevailed for nearly a week, its wavessparkling and dashing into foam in the March sunshine; the distantcliffs and mountains of its other shore just visible in the clear air.It was an exhilarating sight--the first free water that I had seen sincethe summer, and it seemed rejoicing in its freedom, leaping up with gleeto greet the mighty ally that had struck off its fetters.But from this point troubles began to grow. We dropped down presently tothe shore and passed along the glare surface of lagoon after lagoon, thewind doing what it liked with the sled, for it was impossible to handleit at all. Sometimes we went along broadside on, sometimes the sledfirst and the dogs trailing behind, moving their silly, helpless pawsfrom side to side as they were dragged over the ice on their bellies.When we had passed these lagoons the trail took the beach, runningalongside and just to windward of a telephone-line, with rough shoreice to the left and bare rocks to the right. Again and again the alreadyinjured sled was smashed heavily against a telephone pole. I would seethe impact coming and strive my utmost to avert it, but without a geepole, and swinging the sled only by the handle-bars, it was more than Icould do to hold the sled on its course against the beam wind that wasforcing it towards the ice and the telephone poles; and a gee pole couldnot be used at the rate we had travelled ever since we left Candle. Mileafter mile we went along in this way. I do not know how many poles I hitand how many I missed, but every pole on that stretch of coast was afresh and separate anxiety and menace to me. I think I would have beenperfectly willing to have abolished and wiped out the whole invention ofthe telephone so I could be rid of those hateful poles. What weretelephone poles doing in the arctic regions anyway? Telephone polesbelonged with electric cars and interurban trolley-lines, not with dogteams and sleds.Then it grew dark and the wind increased. I did not know it, but I wasapproaching that stretch of coast which is notorious as the windiestplace in all Alaska, a place the topography of which makes it a naturalfunnel for the outlet of wind should any be blowing anywhere in theinterior of the peninsula. My companions were far ahead, long since outof sight. I struggled along a little farther, and, just after aparticularly bad collision and an overturning, I saw a light glimmeringin the snow to my right. It was a little road-house, buried to the eavesand over the roof in snow-drift, with window tunnels and a door tunnelexcavated in the snow. I was yet, I learned, five miles from Solomon's,my destination, but I hailed this haven as my refuge for the night andwent no farther, more exhausted by the struggle of the last two or threehours than by many an all-day tramp on snow-shoes. It was a miserable,dirty little shack, but it was tight; it meant shelter from thatpitiless wind. That night the thermometer stood at 7°, the first plustemperature in twenty-two days.By morning the gale had greatly diminished, and by the time I reachedSolomon's and rejoined my companions it was calm, the first calm sincewe left the middle Kobuk. We had some rough ice to cross to avoid a longdetour of the coast, and then we were back on the shore again and itbegan to snow. The snow was soon done and the sun shone, but the newcoating of dazzling white gave such a glare that it was necessary to puton the snow glasses for the first time of the winter--and that is alwaysa sign winter draws to a close.[Sidenote: DOGS AND REINDEER]On the approach to Nome we had our first encounter with reindeer, and atonce my dog team became unmanageable. I had had some trouble thatmorning with a horse. A new dog I procured at Kikitaruk had never seen ahorse before, and made frantic efforts to get at him, leaping at hishaunches as we passed by. But when they saw the reindeer the whole teamset off at a run, dragging the heavy sled as if it were nothing. TheEsquimau driving the deer saw the approaching dogs and hastily drew hisequipage off the trail farther inshore, standing between the deer andthe dogs with a heavy whip. What the result would have been had thedogs reached the deer it is hard to say. I had kept my stand on the stepbehind the sled and managed to check its wild career with the brake andto throw it over and stop the approach before the carnivora reachedtheir immemorial prey. Herein lies one of the difficulties of thedomestication of reindeer in Alaska, a country where so far dogs havebeen the only domestic animals. Again, as we entered the outskirts ofNome the incident was repeated, and only the hasty driving of thereindeer into a barn prevented the dogs from seizing the deer that time.[Sidenote: NOME]Jimmy was long deposed from his ineffectual leadership and a little dognamed Kewalik--the one I obtained at Kikitaruk--was at the head of theteam. Kewalik had never seen so many houses before; hitherto almostevery cabin he had reached on his journeys had been a resting-place, andhe wanted to dive into every house we passed. At Candle and Councilboth, our stopping-place had been near the entrance to the little town.But now we had to pass up one long street after another and I hadcontinually to drag him and the team he led first from a yard on thisside of the road and then from one on the other. The dog was perfectlybewildered and out of his head by the number of people and the number ofhouses he saw. We were indeed a sorry, travel-worn, unkempt, uncivilisedband, man and dogs, with an old, battered vehicle, and we felt ourincongruity with the new environment as we entered the metropolis of theluxury and wealth of the North. Here we passed a jeweller's shop, thewhole window aglow with the dull gleam of gold and ivory--the terriblenugget jewellery so much affected in these parts and the walrus ivorywhich is Alaska's other contribution of material for the ornamentalarts. Here we passed a veritable department store, its ground-floorplate-glass window set as a drawing-room, with gilded, brocaded chairs,marquetry table, and ormolu clock, and I know not what costliness of rugand curtain. It was all so strange that it seemed unreal after that longpassage of the savage wilds, that long habitation of huts and igloos andtents. Hitherto we had often been fortunate could we buy a little flourand bacon; here the choice comestibles of the earth were for sale. Ilooked askance at my greasy parkee as I passed shops where Englishbroadcloth and Scotch tweeds were displayed; at my worn, clumsy muklukswhen I saw patent-leather pumps. But Nome knows how to welcome thewanderer from the wilderness and to make him altogether at home. Therecould be no warmer hospitality than that with which I was received bythe Reverend John White and his wife, than that which I had at many ahome during my week's stay.Nothing in the world could have caused the building of a city where Nomeis built except the thing that caused it: the finding of gold on thebeach itself and in the creeks immediately behind it. It has no harbouror roadstead, no shelter or protection of any kind; it is in as bleakand exposed a position as a man would find if he should set out to huntthe earth over for ineligible sites.But Nome is also a fine instance of the way men in the North conquerlocal conditions and wring comfort out of bleakness and desolation bythe clever adaptation of means to ends.The art of living comfortably in the North had to be learned, and it hasbeen learned pretty thoroughly. People live at Nome as well as they do"outside." One may sit down to dinners as well cooked, as wellfurnished, as well served as any dinners anywhere. The good folk of Nomedelight in spreading their dainty store before the unjaded appetite ofthe winter traveller, and it would be affectation to deny that there iskeen relish of enjoyment in the long-unwonted gleam of wax candle orelectrolier upon perfect appointment of glass, silver, and napery, inthe unobtrusive but vigilant service of white-jacketed Chinaman or Jap.Nome has a great advantage over its only rival in the interior,Fairbanks, in the matter of freight rates. The same merchandise that islanded at the one place for ten or twelve dollars a ton within ten ortwelve days of its leaving Seattle, costs fifty or sixty at the other,and takes a month or more to arrive. But this accessibility in thesummer is exactly reversed in the winter. No practicable route has beendiscovered along the uninhabited shores of Bering Sea, and all the mailfor Nome comes from Valdez to Fairbanks and then down the Yukon andround Norton Sound by dog team. In winter Fairbanks is within seven oreight days of open salt water; Nome a full month. After navigationcloses in October, the first mail does not commonly reach the SewardPeninsula until January. So that, with all its comforts and luxuries,Nome is a very isolated place for eight months in the year.[Illustration: GOLD-MINING AT NOME.][Illustration: PULLING THE "PELICAN" OUT WITH A "SPANISH WINDLASS."][Sidenote: MINING AT NOME]We went out with the dog sled to the diggings a few miles behind thetown, and a busy scene we found, enveloped in steam and smoke. Here anold beach line had been discovered and was yielding rich reward for theworking. A long line of conical "dumps" marked its extension roughlyparallel with the present shore, and the buckets that arose from thedepths, travelled along a cable, and at just the right moment upsettheir contents, continually added to these heaps. All the winter"pay-dirt" is thus excavated and stored; in the summer when the streamsrun the gold is sluiced out. But that phrase "when the streams run"covers a world of difficulty and expense to the miner. In some places inthis Seward Peninsula, ditches thirty and forty miles long have beenconstructed to insure the streams running when and where they areneeded.There was quite a little to do in Nome. A new sled must be bought, andanother dog, and, above all, some arrangement made about a travellingcompanion. I was not willing to hire a native who would have to returnhere, and I was resolved never again to travel alone. So I put anadvertisement in the newspaper, desiring communication with some man whowas intending a journey to Fairbanks immediately, and was fortunate tomeet a sober, reliable man who undertook to accompany and assist me forthe payment of his travelling expenses.The week wore rapidly away, and I began to be eager to depart, mindfulof the eight hundred odd miles yet to be covered. Spring seemed alreadyhere and summer treading upon her heels, for the town was all slush andmud from a decided "soft snap," the thermometer standing well abovefreezing for days in succession.A visitor to this place is struck by the number of articles made fromwalrus ivory exposed for sale, chief amongst them being cribbage-boards.A walk down the streets would argue the whole population given over tothe incessant playing of cribbage. The explanation is found in thedifficulty of changing the direction of Esquimau activity once thatdirection is established. These clever artificers were started makingcribbage-boards long ago and it seems impossible to stop them. Everysummer they come in from their winter hunting with fresh supplies carvedduring the leisure of the long nights. The beautiful walrus tusk becomesalmost an ugly thing when it is thus hacked flat and bored full ofholes. The best pieces of Esquimau carving are not these things, made bythe dozen, but the domestic implements made for their own use, and someof this work is very clever and tasteful indeed, adorned with fine boldetchings of the chase of walrus, seal, and polar bear.CHAPTER VNOME TO FAIRBANKS--NORTON SOUND--THE KALTAG PORTAGE--NULATO--UP THEYUKON TO TANANAWE left Nome on the 13th of March, the night before being taken up by abanquet which the Commercial Club was kind enough to give me; indeed,the whole stay was marked by lavish kindness and hospitality, and I leftwith the feeling that Nome was one of the most generous and open-handedplaces I had ever visited.The soft weather continued and made sloppy travel. Our course lay allaround Norton Sound to Unalaklík, and then over the portage to Kaltag onthe Yukon; up the Yukon to the mouth of the Tanana, and then up thatriver to Fairbanks. The first day's run was the retracing of our stepsto Solomon's, and that was done without difficulty save for a newtrouble with the dogs. It appeared that we no longer had any leader. Allthe winter through my team had been behind another team, and thatconstant second place had turned our leaders into followers. We thoughtwe had two leaders, but neither one was willing to proceed without someone or something ahead of him. On such good ice-going as this it was outof the question for one of us to run ahead of the team simply to pleasethese leader-perverts, and the whip had to be wielded heavily on Jimmy'sback ere he could be induced to fill his proper office--and then he didit ill, with constant exasperating stoppings and lookings-back. AtSolomon's I met a man who had spent some years with Peary in his arcticexplorations, and I sat up far into the night drawing interestingnarratives out of him. So far as Topkok we were still retracing oursteps, but once over the great bluff, which gave no view this time owingto the mist which accompanies this soft weather, we were on new ground,our course lying wholly along the beach.At Bluff was the most interesting, curious gold mining I have ever seen,the extraction of gold from the sand of Norton Sound, two hundred yardsor more out from the beach. There it lies under ten or twelve feet ofwater with the ice on top. How shall it be reached? Why, by the exactconverse of the usual Alaskan placer mining; by freezing down instead ofthawing down. The ice is cut away from the beginning of a shaft, almostbut not quite down to the water, leaving just a thin cake. Theatmospheric cold, penetrating this cake, freezes the water below it, andpresently the hole is chopped down a little farther, leaving always athin cake above the water. A canvas chute is arranged over the shaft,with a head like a ship's ventilator that can be turned any way to catchthe wind. Gradually the water is frozen down, and as it is frozen moreand more ice is removed until the bottom is reached, surrounded andprotected by a cylindrical shaft of ice; then the sand can be removedand the gold it contains washed out. They told us they were making goodmoney and their ingenuity certainly deserved it.[Sidenote: ICE TRAVEL]We stopped that night at the native village of Chinnik, the people ofwhich are looked after by a mission of the Swedish Evangelical Church onGolofnin Bay, which we should cross to-morrow. But the mission is offthe trail, and we did not come to an acquaintance with the missionariesof this body until we reached Unalaklík. Next day, climbing anddescending considerable grades in warm, misty weather, we reachedGolofnin Bay, pursued it some distance, and left it by a very steep,long hill that was close to one thousand feet high, at the foot of whichwe were once more on the beach of the sound--and at the road-house forthe night. From that place the trail no longer hugged the coast butstruck out boldly across the ice for a distant headland, Moses' Point,where we lunched, and, that point reached, struck out again for Isaac'sPoint, most of the travelling during a long day in which we madeforty-eight miles being four or five miles from land. The day was clear,and the shore-line of the other side of the sound, which grew nearer aswe proceeded, was subject to strange distortions of mirage. Theroad-house that night nestled picturesquely against a great bluff, andright across the ice lay Texas Point, for which we should make abee-line to-morrow. Sometimes the traveller must go all round NortonBay, but at this time the ice was in good condition and our route cutacross the mouth of the bay for twenty-two miles straight for the otherside. It was like crossing from Dover to Calais on the ice. The passagemade, the Alaskan mainland was reached once more, the Seward Peninsulaleft behind us, and our way lay across desolate, low-lying tundrastrewn with driftwood and hollowed out here and there into littlelagoons. Evidently the waves sweep clean across it in stormy weatherwhen the sound is open; a salt marsh. In the midst of it reared a sortof lookout tripod of driftwood thirty or forty feet high, lashed andnailed together, with a precarious little platform on top and cleatsnailed to one of the uprights for ascent. I essayed the view, but therusty nails broke under my feet. We deemed it a hunting tower from whichwater-fowl might be spied in the spring. Sixteen miles of thismelancholy waste brought us to the shore again, to a tiny Esquimauvillage and a tumble-down, half-buried shack of a road-house where weshould spend the night, a little schooner lying beached in front of it.If its exterior were uninviting, the scene as we entered was sinister.By the light of a single candle--though it was not yet darkoutside--amidst unwashed dishes and general grime, sat an evil-eyedPortuguese or Spaniard, in a red toque, playing poker with threeskin-clad Esquimaux. So absorbed were they in the game that they had notheard us arrive nor seen us enter. With a brief, reluctant interval forthe preparation of a poor supper, the card playing went on all theevening far into the night. My companion discovered that the chips wereworth a dollar apiece and judged it to be "considerable of a game." Atlast I arose from my bunk and said that we were tired and had come thereto sleep, and with an ill grace the playing was shortly abandoned andthe natives went off. The arctic shores have their beach-combers as wellas the South Sea Islands.[Sidenote: UNALAKLÍK]The next day was Sunday, but I was anxious to spend my day of rest atUnalaklík and most indisposed to spend it here, so we got away with avery early start long before daylight. Six or seven miles of tundra andlagoon travel and the trail crossed abruptly a tongue of land and struckout over the salt-water ice for a cape fifteen miles away. The going wassplendid. It was not glare ice, but ice upon which snow had melted andfrozen again. It was so smooth that one dog could have drawn the sled,yet not so smooth as to deny good footing. We kept well out to sea,passing close to the mountainous mass of Besborough Island, plainlyriven by some ancient convulsion from the sheer bluffs of the mainland.Our only trouble was in keeping the dogs well enough out, for, not beingwater-spaniels or other marine species, they had a hankering after theland and a continual tendency to edge in to shore.So from headland to headland we made rapid, easy traverse, thoroughlyenjoying the ride, munching chocolate and raisins, speculating about theseasons when it had been possible to cross direct from Nome to SaintMichael on the ice, and exchanging stories we had heard of the disastersand hairbreadth escapes attending such overbold venture. Only thiswinter three men and a dog team were blown out into Bering Sea by asudden storm, and lay for four days in their sleeping-bags drifting upand down on an ice cake, until at last they were blown back to the shoreice and made their escape. And there is a fine story of a white manrescued in half-frozen state by his Esquimau wife, and carried for mileson her back to safety.At last we turned a point and drew in to the shore, and, not seeing thelittle town till we were almost upon it, arrived at Unalaklík early inthe afternoon. We had made the two hundred and forty miles, as it iscalled, from Nome, in six days. In the last twelve days of travel we hadcovered five hundred miles, an average of nearly forty-two miles perday, far and away the best travelling of the winter. The preceding fivehundred miles had taken twenty-two days.We were in time to attend the Esquimau services at the mission bothafternoon and night, and I found them very much the same as atKikitaruk, with the exception that the singing was much more advancedand was very good indeed. There was an anthem of the Danks type sung bya choir--the parts well maintained throughout, the attacks good, thevoices under excellent control--that it pleased and surprised me tohear, and there was a long discourse most patiently and, as I judged,faithfully interpreted by a bright-looking Esquimau boy. It is well forthose who speak much through an interpreter to listen occasionally tosimilar discourse. Only so may its unavoidable tediousness beappreciated.[Sidenote: GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS]The school next day pleased me still more, and I was glad that I had aschool-day at the place. I heard good reading and spelling, saw goodwriting, and listened with real enjoyment to the fresh young voicesraised again and again in song. There was, however, something socuriously exotic that for a moment it seemed irresistibly funny, in "TheOld Oaken Bucket," from lips that have difficulty with the vowel soundsof English; from children that never saw a well and never will seeone;--and I was irreverent enough to have much the same feeling about "Ilove thy templed hills," etc., in that patriotic Plymouth Rock songwhich is so little adapted for universal American use that, in a gibenot without justice, it has been called "Smith's Country, 'tis of Thee."One wonders if they sing it in the Philippine schools; and, so far asthese regions are concerned, one wishes that some teacher with a sparkof genius would take Goldsmith's hint and write a simple song forEsquimau children that should        "Extol the treasures of their finny seas         And their long nights of revelry and ease";the splendour of summer's perpetual sunshine and the weird radiance ofthe Northern Lights; but prosody is not taught in your "Normal" school.The thing is a vain, artificial attempt to impose a whole body of ideas,notions, standards of comparison, metaphors, similes, and sentimentsupon a race to which, in great measure, they must ever be foreign andunintelligible. Here were girls reading in a text-book of so-calledphysiology, and, as it happened, the lesson that day was on the evils oftight lacing! The reading of that book, I was informed, is imposed byspecial United States statute, and the teacher must make a separatereport that so much of it has been duly gone through each month beforethe salary can be drawn. Yet none of those girls ever saw a corset orever will. One is reminded of the dear old lady who used to visit thejails and distribute tracts on _The Evils of Keeping Bad Company_.But these incongruities aside, the school was a good school and welltaught, the government appointing the teachers, as I learned, upon thenomination of the mission authorities; the only way that a governmentschool can be successful at any mission station, for the two agenciesmust work together, as one's right hand works with one's left, to effectany satisfactory result. The hours spent in it were very enjoyable, andone wished one might have had opportunity for further acquaintance withsome of the bright-faced, interesting children, both full-bloods andhalf-breeds.Unalaklík is a thriving Esquimau community, noted for its nativeschooner building and its successful seal hunters and fishermen. We wererejoiced to see signs of native prosperity and advance, and we leftUnalaklík with high hope for its future.Here also was real rest and refreshment at a road-house. Road-houses inAlaska are as various in quality as inns are "outside." Our previousnight's halt was at one of the worst; this was one of the best. Theproprietor was a good cook and he did his best for us, with omelet andpastry, and young, tender reindeer. It has been said that road-housekeeping in Alaska is like soliciting life insurance "outside," the lastresort of incompetence. Certain it is that a thoroughly lazy andincompetent man may yet make a living keeping a road-house, for there isno rivalry save at the more important points, and travellers arecommonly so glad to reach any shelter that they are not disposed to becensorious. None the less, when they find a man who takes a pride in hisbusiness and an interest in the comfort of his guests, they are highlyappreciative.[Sidenote: THE KALTAG PORTAGE]We should have only an occasional road-house from now on, but expectedto reach some inhabited cabin each night. Our good travelling was overthough we did not know it. We knew that the hard snows of the SewardPeninsula and the bare ice of Norton Sound were behind us, but we kepttelling ourselves that the travel of all the winter would surely haveleft a fine trail on the Yukon. We were now about sixty-five miles fromSaint Michael, by the coast. But taking the ninety-mile portage fromUnalaklík to Kaltag we should reach the Yukon River more than fivehundred miles above Saint Michael, so much does that portage cut off.This is the route the military telegraph-line takes, and we shouldtravel along close beside it much of the way until the Yukon wasreached.The soft weather persisted, and we had even doubt about starting out insuch a rapid thaw. A visit to the telegraph station informed us that thewarm wave was spread all over interior Alaska and that there was generalexpectation of an early break-up. But if the snow on the portage wereindeed rapidly going, that was all the more reason for getting acrossbefore it had altogether gone; so we pulled out in the warm, muggyweather, and even as we pulled out it began to rain!Up the little Unalaklík River, water over the ice everywhere, we wentfor a few miles and then took to the tundra. All the snow had goneexcept just the hard snow of the trail, a winding ribbon of white acrossthe brown moss. The rain changed to sleet and back to rain again, andsoon we were wet through and had much trouble in keeping thatpenetrating, persistent drizzle from wetting our load through the canvascover. Though not an unique experience, it is rare to be wet with rainon the winter trail--rarer in the interior probably than on the coast.Once since on the Kuskokwim and once on the Fortymile it has happened tome in seven winters' travel. We pushed on for thirty miles, past severallittle native villages, until we came to Whaleback, a village partEsquimau and part Indian. These were the last Esquimaux we should see,and I was sorry, for I had grown to like very heartily and to respectvery sincerely this kindly, gentle, industrious, good-humoured race.Surely they are a people any nation may be proud to have fringing itsotherwise uninhabitable coasts, and should be eager to aid and conserve.There comes a feeling of impotent exasperation to me when I realise howmany white men there are who speak of them continually with the utmostcontempt and see them dwindle with entire complacency. The same thing istrue in even more marked degree about the Indians of the interior: ninetenths of the land will never have other inhabitant, of that I amconvinced, and the only question is, shall it be an inhabited wildernessor an uninhabited wilderness? Here, lodging with the natives, and, Imake no doubt, living off them too, we found a queer, skulking white manwhom I had met in several different sections of interior Alaska, knownas "Snow-shoe Joe" or "The Frozen Hobo." The arctic regions one wouldesteem a poor place for the hobo, but this man manages to eke out anexistence, if not to flourish, therein. Work he will not under anycircumstances, but subsists on the hospitality of the whites until hehas entirely worn it out and then removes to the natives, mushing fromcamp to camp and "bumming" his way as he goes. He was on his way toSaint Michael, he told me with perfect gravity, "to get work."[Sidenote: THE U. S. SIGNAL-CORPS]Before dark we had reached our destination for the night at the OldWoman Mountain, the divide between the waters of the Yukon and thewaters of Norton Sound, and were kindly received and well treated at thetelegraph station, the only resort on this portage for weary travellers.Here is surely a lonely post. For reasons connected with the maintenanceof the wires and the keeping open of communications, it is necessary tohave telegraph stations every forty or fifty miles, each with two orthree men and a dog team, and shelter cabins about half-way betweenstations. A wind that blows a tree down in the narrow right-of-way cutthrough the forest--for we were come to forest again--or a heavysnowfall that loads branches until they fall across the wires, a postthat comes up out of its hole as the thawing of spring heaves the groundaround it, or the caving of the bank of a stream along which the linepasses--any one of a dozen such happenings anywhere along its thousandmiles of course, may put the entire inland telegraph system out ofoperation; and the young men in whose section the interruptionoccurs--they have a means of determining that--must get out at once,find the seat of the trouble and repair it. In all sorts of weather,unless the thermometer be below -40°, out they must go.It may be doubted if any other army in the world ever constructed andmaintained a permanent telegraph line under such arduous conditions. Ithas been the army's one contribution to Alaska, the one justificationfor the enormous expense of maintaining army posts in the interior.Indeed it is often said by those who feel keenly the neglect of theterritory by the general government that this telegraph system is theone contribution of the United States to Alaska. It is certainly a greatpublic convenience and has assisted very materially in such developmentas the country has made. The men of the signal-corps deserve greatcredit for the faithful, dogged way in which they have carried out yearafter year their difficult and hazardous work, and often and often theweather-stressed traveller has been grateful for the hospitality whichtheir cabins have afforded him.They have not been an unmixed blessing to the country; soldiers do notusually represent the highest morale of the nation, and though thesignal-corps is in some respect a picked corps, yet the men aresoldiers, with many of the soldier characteristics. Too often a remotetelegraph station has been a little centre of drunkenness, gambling, anddebauchery with a little circumference of native men and women, andwhile some of the officers of the corps have been willing and anxious todo all in their power to suppress this sort of thing in their scatteredand difficult commands, others have been jealous only for the technicalefficiency of their work.[Sidenote: MORE SNOW]There are many allowances to be made for young men taken from thesociety of their kind and thrust out hundreds of miles in the wildernessto sit down for a year or two at one of these isolated spots. They maysee no women save those amongst a straggling band of Indians for thewhole time of their exile; they may see no white man save amail-carrier--and in many places not even a mail-carrier--for weekstogether. Time sometimes hangs very heavily on their hands, for treesare not always blowing down, nor wires snapping through the tension ofthe cold, and at some stations there will not be a dozen telegraphmessages sent the whole winter through. If a young man be at allambitious of self-improvement, here is splendid opportunity of leisure,but a great many are not at all so disposed. Character, except the mostfirmly founded, is apt to deteriorate under such circumstances;standards of conduct to be lowered. And what is here written of theyoung men of the signal-corps may well apply in great measure to a largeproportion of all the white men in the country.The "eighty-mile portage" we had heard of at Nome became ninety miles atUnalaklík, and added another five to itself here, so that although wehad travelled forty-two miles that day we were told that there were yetfifty-three ahead before we reached the Yukon.So we decided not to attempt it in one day and to rest the next night ata "repair cabin" twenty-eight miles farther, making a somewhat latestart in view of a short journey. It had been wiser to have startedearly. During our night at Old Woman Mountain some three inches of snowfell, and we found as we descended the Yukon slope that all the moisturethat had fallen upon us as rain the previous day had fallen on this sideas snow. The trail was filled full and buried, and so soft and mushy wasit that although snow-shoes were badly needed they were impossible. Thesnow clung to them and came off the ground with them in heavy, cloggingmasses every time they were lifted. It clung to the sled, to theharness, to the dogs' feet, to everything that touched it; it gatheredin ever-increasing snowballs on the long hair of the dogs. Travelling inwarm weather in loose, new snow is most disagreeable work. We pluggedalong for twenty miles, and then in the dark in an open country withlittle patches of scattering spruce, had great trouble in finding thetrail at all.At last we could find it no longer, and when there was no hope ofreaching the cabin that night we made a camp. We had now no tent orstove with us, so a "Siwash camp" in the open was the best we could do,and a wet, miserable camp it was. By inexcusable carelessness on mypart, candles had been altogether forgotten in the replenishing of thesupplies, and a little piece an inch long which we found loose in thegrub box was all that we possessed. Dogs and men alike exhausted withthe long day's sweating struggle through the deep snow, sleep shouldhave come soundly and soon. It did to the rest, but I lay awake thenight through. The easy, riding travel of the preceding week had been apoor preparation for to-day's incessant toil, and I was too tired tosleep. In the morning our bedding was covered with a couple of inchesof new snow. My companion got up at daylight and made a journey ofinvestigation ahead, following the trail better, but not finding thecabin. We had thought ourselves within a mile or two of it, butevidently were farther away. However, when we had eaten a hastybreakfast and hitched up and had gone along the trail that had beenbroken that morning to its end, ten yards beyond the place where mycompanion had turned back, we came in sight of the cabin, and there welay and rested and dried things out all day and spent the next night.During the day there came a team from Kaltag, and once again we enjoyedthe delight of receiving, and at the same time conferring, the richestgift and greatest possible benefit to the traveller--a trail.[Sidenote: THE YUKON ONCE MORE]The next evening as it drew towards dark, after another day of soft,warm disagreeable travel, we reached the end of the portage, and thebroad white Yukon stretched before us once more. Our hearts leaped upand I think the dogs' hearts leaped up also at the sight. I called toNanook as we stopped on the bank, "Nanook, there's the good old Yukonagain!" and he lifted his voice in that intelligent, significant barkthat surely meant that he saw and understood. We had left the Yukon onthe 15th of December at Fort Yukon; we reached it again on the 23d ofMarch at Kaltag, more than six hundred miles lower down. We had twohundred and fifty miles of travel on its surface before us, and thenclose to another two hundred and fifty up the Tanana River to Fairbanks.But alas! for the fine Yukon trail we had promised ourselves! As welooked out across the broad river there was no narrow, dark lineundulating over its surface, nor even a faint, continuous inequality tohint that trail had been, on snow "less hideously serene"; its perfectsmoothness and whiteness were unscarred and unsullied. The trail waswiped out and swallowed up by the late snows and winds.[Sidenote: A LEARNED JESUIT]There is little interest in lingering over the long, laborious,monotonous grind up that river on show-shoes. When one has lookedforward to pleasant, quick travel, the disappointment at slow, heavyplodding is the keener. The first little bit of trail we had was as weapproached Nulato two days later on a Sunday morning, and it was made bythe villagers from below going up to church at the Roman Catholicmission. We arrived in time for service, and enjoyed the natives' voicesraised in the Latin chants as well as in hymns wisely put into thevernacular. It is historically a little curious to find Roman Catholicnatives singing praises in their own tongue, and Protestant missions,like those on the Kobuk and Kotzebue Sound, using a language "notunderstanded of the people." The day was the Feast of the Annunciationas well as Sunday, and there was some special decorating of the churchand perhaps some elaboration of the music. Here for the first and onlytime I listened to a white man so fluent and vigorous in the nativetongue that he gave one the impression of eloquence. Father Jetté of theSociety of Jesus is the most distinguished scholar in Alaska. He is thechief authority on the native language, and manners and customs, beliefsand traditions of the Middle Yukon, and has brought to the patient,enthusiastic labour of years the skill of the trained philologist. Itis said by the Indians that he knows more of the Indian language thanany one of them does, and this is not hard to believe when it isunderstood that he has systematically gleaned his knowledge from widelyscattered segments of tribes, jotting down in his note-books old formsof speech lingering amongst isolated communities, and legends andfolk-lore stories still remembered by the aged but not much repeatednowadays; always keen to add to his store or to verify or disprove someetymological conjecture that has occurred to his fertile mind. His workis recognised by the ethnological societies of Europe, and much of hiscollected material has been printed in their technical journals.A man of wide general culture, master of three or four modern, as wellas the classic, languages, a mathematician, a writer of beautiful, clearEnglish, although it is not his mother tongue, he carries it with themodesty, the broad-minded tolerance, the easy urbanity that alwaysadorn, though they by no means always accompany, the profession of thescholar; and one is better able to understand after some years'acquaintance with such a man, after falling under the authority of hislearning and the charm of his courtesy, the wonderful power which thesociety he belongs to has wielded in the world. If such devotion to theinstruction of the ignorant as was described at the mission on themiddle Kobuk be praiseworthy, by how much the more is one moved toadmiration at the spectacle of this man, who might fill with credit anyone of half a dozen professional chairs at the ordinary college, gladlyconsecrating his life to the teaching of an Indian school!Hearing an interest expressed in the massacre which took place at Nulatoin 1851, Father Jetté offered to accompany us to the site of thatoccurrence, about a mile away. It stands out prominently in the historyof a country that has been singularly free from bloodshed and outrage,and its date is the notable date of the middle river, as theestablishment of the post at Fort Yukon by the Hudson Bay Company in1846 is the notable date of the upper river. They are fixed points inIndian chronology by which it is possible to approximate other dates andto reach an estimate of the ages of old people.[Sidenote: THE NULATO MASSACRE]Much has been written about the Nulato massacre, and the accounts varyin many particulars. The Russian post here was first established byMalakof in 1838. Burned during his absence by the Indians, it wasre-established by Lieutenant Zagoskin of the Russian navy in 1842. Theextortions and cruelties of his successor, Deerzhavin, complicated by astanding feud between two native tribes, and probably having the rivalpowers of certain medicine-men as the match to the mine, brought aboutthe destruction of the place and the death of all its inhabitants, whiteand native, by a sudden treacherous attack of the Koyukuk Indians. Ithappened that Lieutenant Barnard of the British navy, detached from awar-ship lying at Saint Michael to journey up the river and makeinquiries of the Koyukuk natives as to wandering white men, survivors ofSir John Franklin's expedition, who might have been seen or heard of bythem, was staying at the post at the time and perished in the generalmassacre. His grave, with a headboard bearing a Latin inscription, isneatly kept up by the Jesuit priests at Nulato.In the last few years the river has been invading the bank upon whichthe old village stood, and as the earth caves in relics of the slaughterand burning come to light. Old copper kettles and samovars, buttons andglass beads, all sorts of metal vessels and implements have been sortedout from charred wood and ashes, together with numerous skulls andquantities of bones. One of the most interesting of these relics was abrass button from an official coat, with the Russian crowneddouble-headed eagle on the face, and on the back, upon examination witha lens, the word "Birmingham."Half the day serving for our day of rest this week, we were up and readyto start early the next morning, but so violent a wind was blowing fromthe southeast that we decided to remain, and the clatter of thecorrugated iron roof and the whirling whiteness outside the windows madeus glad to be in shelter. As the day advanced the wind increased toalmost hurricane force, and the two-story house in which we lay began torock in such a manner as to make the proprietor alarmed for hisdwelling.There was an "independent" trading-post at this village which seemed topresent an object-lesson in rapacity and greed. There was not an articleof standard quality in the store; the clothing was the most rascallyshoddy, the canned goods of the poorest brands; the whole stock thecheapest stuff that could possibly be bought at bargain prices"outside," yet the prices were higher even than those that prevail inAlaska for the best merchandise. Loud complaints are often made againstthe commercial corporation which does the great bulk of the business ininterior Alaska, yet if the writer had to choose whether he would be inthe hands of that company or in the hands of an "independent" trader, hewould unhesitatingly cast in his lot with the company. The independenttrader makes money, sometimes makes large money, and makes it fairlyeasily, but the calling seems to appeal mainly, if not wholly, to men oflow character and no conscience. There are few things that would redoundmore to the benefit of the Indian than a great improvement in thecharacter of the men with whom he is compelled to do business.The wind had subsided by the next morning and had been of benefit ratherthan injury to us, for it had blown the accumulated new snow off the oldtrail so that it was possible to perceive and follow it. But what wasour surprise to find, with the recollection of that rattling roof andswaying building fresh in our minds, that ten miles away there had beenno wind at all! The snow lay undisturbed on every twig and bough fromwhich the gentlest breeze would have dislodged it. One never ceases towonder at what, for want of a better word, must be called the_localness_ of much of the weather in Alaska--though, for that matter,in all probability it is characteristic of weather in all countries. Thehabit of continual outdoor travel gives scope as well as edge to one'sobservation of such things which a life in one place denies. Thatwind-storm had cut a clean swath across the Yukon valley. Yet it seemsstrange that so violent a disturbance could take place without affectingand, to some extent, agitating the atmosphere for many miles adjacent.[Sidenote: SNOW GLASSES]So, sometimes in snow-storm, sometimes in wind, always on snow-shoes andoften hard put to it to find and follow the trail at all, we struggledon for two or three days more, sleeping one night at a wood-chopper'shut, another in a telegraph cabin crowded with foul-mouthed infantrymensent out to repair the extensive damage of the recent storm and none toopleased at the detail, we plodded our weary way up that interminableriver. At last we met the mail-man, that ever-welcome person on theAlaskan trail, and his track greatly lightened our labour. By hispermission we broke into his padlocked cabin that night by the skilfulapplication of an axe-edge to a link of the chain, and were morecomfortable than we had been for some time. Past the mouth of theKoyukuk, past Grimcop, past Lowden, past Melozikaket to Kokrine's andMouse Point, we plugged along, making twenty-two miles one day andthirty another and then dropping again to eighteen. The temperaturedropped to zero, and a keen wind made it necessary to keep the nosecontinually covered. At this time of year the covering of the noseinvolves a fresh annoyance, for it deflects the breath upward, and themoisture of it continually condenses on the snow glasses, which meanscontinual wiping. A stick of some sort of waxy compound to be rubbedupon the glass, bought in New York as a preventive of the deposit ofmoisture, proved entirely useless. In this respect the Esquimau snowgoggle, which is simply a piece of wood hollowed out into a cup andilluminated by narrow slits, has advantage over any shape or kind ofglass protection. A French metal device of the same order that isadvertised in the dealer's catalogues was found to fail, perhaps owingto a wrong optical arrangement of the slits. It caused an eye-strainthat brought on headache. But if that principle could be scientificallyworked out and such a device perfected, it would be a boon to thetraveller over sun-lit snow, for it would do away with glass altogether,with its two chief objections--its fragility and its opacity whencovered with vapour.[Sidenote: SNOW-BLINDNESS]The indispensability of some eye protection when travelling in the latewinter, and the serious consequences that follow its neglect, were onceagain demonstrated at Mouse Point. The road-house was crowded with"busted" stampeders coming out of the Nowikaket country. There had beena report of a rich "strike" on a creek of the Nowitna, late the previousfall, and a number of men from other camps--some from as far asNome--had gone in there with "outfits" for the winter. The stampede hadbeen a failure; no gold was found; there was much indignant assertionthat no gold ever _had_ been found and that the reported "strike" was a"fake," though to what end or profit such a "fake" stampede should becaused, unless by some neighbouring trader, it is hard to understand;and here were the stampeders streaming out again, a ragged, unkempt,sorry-looking crowd in every variety of worn-out arctic toggery, manyof them suffering from acute snow-blindness. It is surprising that evenold-timers will go out in the hills for the whole winter withoutproviding themselves with protection against the glare of the sun whichthey know will inevitably assail their eyes before the spring, yet so itis; and this lack of forethought is not confined to the matter of snowglasses: the first half dozen men we received in Saint Matthew'sHospital at Fairbanks suffering from severely frozen feet were allold-timers grown careless.Father Ragarou, another Jesuit priest of another type, reached theroad-house from the opposite direction about the same time we did, and Iwas interested in watching his treatment of the inflamed eyes. Upon adisk of lead he folded a little piece of cotton cloth in the shape of atent, and, setting fire to it, allowed it to burn out completely. Thenwith a wet camel's-hair brush he gathered up the slight yellow residuumof the combustion and painted it over the eyes, holding the lids openwith thumb and finger and drawing the brush through and through. Anincredulous spectator, noticing the sacred monogram neatly stamped uponthe disk of lead, made some sneering remark to me about "Romishsuperstition," but remembering the Jesuit's bark, and recalling that Ihad in my writing-case at that moment a letter I had brought all the wayfrom the Koyukuk addressed to this very priest, begging for a furthersupply of a pile ointment that had proved efficacious, I held my peace.Whether it be an oxide or a carbonate, or some salt that is formed bythe combustion, I am not chemist enough to know, but I saw man after manrelieved by this application. Even the scoffer was convinced there wasmerit in the treatment, though stoutly protesting that "them letters"had nothing to do with it; which nobody took the trouble to argue withhim. My own custom--we are all of us doctors of a sort in thiscountry--is to instil a few drops of a five-per-cent solution ofcocaine, which gives immediate temporary relief, and then apply frequentwashes of boric acid, bandaging up the eyes completely in bad cases bycloths kept wet with the solution. But I do not know that it bringsbetter result than the lead treatment. Certainly it is a matter in whichan ounce of any sort of prevention is better than a pound of any sort ofcure. The affection is a serious one, being nothing more or less thanacute ophthalmia; the pain is very severe, and repeated attacks are saidto bring permanent weakness of the eyes. Smoked glasses or goggles,[A]veils of green or blue or black, even a crescent eye-shade cut out of apiece of birch-bark or cardboard and blackened on its under-side withcharcoal, will prevent the hours and sometimes days of torture whichthis distemper entails.[Sidenote: HORSES AND MULES]For a few miles we had the trail of the stampeders, but when thatcrossed the river we put on our snow-shoes and settled to the steadygrind once more. A day's mush brought us to "The Birches," and anotherto Gold Mountain. Between the two places there was a portage, and thetrail thereon, protected by the timber, was good. We longed for the timewhen all trails in Alaska shall be taken off the rivers and cut in theprotecting forest. But we had gone but a mile along this good trailwhen our hearts sank, for we saw ahead of us a procession of army mulespacking supplies from Fort Gibbon to the telegraph repair parties. Wepulled out into the snow that the mules might pass, and the soldierssaid no word, for they knew just how we felt, until the last soldierleading the last mule was going by, and he turned round and said: "Andher name was Maud!" It was in the height of Opper's popularity, his"comic supplements" the chief dependence of the road-houses forwall-paper. The reference was so apposite that we burst into laughter,but there was nothing funny about the devastation that had been wrought.That good trail was all gone--the bottom pounded out of it--and nothingwas left but a ploughed lane punched full of sink-holes. We had notrouble following the trail on the river after this encounter, but ithad been almost as easy going to have struck out for ourselves in theunbroken snow of the winter. It is hard to make outsiders understand howa man who loves all animals may come to hate horses and mules,particularly mules, in this country. Our travelling is above all amatter of surface. Distance counts and weather counts, but surfacecounts for more than either. See how fast we came across the SewardPeninsula in the most distressing weather imaginable! A well-used dogtrail becomes so hard and smooth that it offers scarce any resistance tothe passage of the sled, and for walking or running over in moccasins ormukluks is the most perfect surface imaginable. The more it is used thebetter it becomes. But put a horse on that trail and in one passage itis ruined. The iron-shod hoofs break through the crust at every step andthrow up the broken pieces as they are withdrawn. With mules it is evenworse; the holes they punch are deeper and sharper. Neither man nor dogcan pass over it again in comfort. One slips and slides about at everystep, the leg leaders and ankle sinews are strained, the soles of thefeet, though hardened by a thousand miles in moccasins, become sore andinflamed, and at night there is a new sort of weariness that only ahorse-ruined trail gives. As a rule, the dog trail is of so littleservice to the horse or mule that it were as cheap to break out a newone in the snow, and it is this knowledge that exasperates the dogmusher. So there is not much love lost between the horse man and the dogman in Alaska.[Sidenote: ARMY POSTS AND NATIVES]At last, after a night at "Old Station," we came in sight of Tanana,where is Fort Gibbon, the one the name of the town and the post-office,the other the name of the military post and the telegraph office. Themilitary authorities refuse to call their post "Fort Tanana" and thepostal authorities refuse to allow the town post-office to be called"Fort Gibbon," so there they lie, cheek by jowl, two separate placeswith a fence between them--a source of endless confusion. A letteraddressed to Fort Gibbon is likely to go astray and a telegram addressedto Tanana to be refused. Stretching along a mile and a half of riverbank, and beginning to come into view ten miles before they are reached,the military and commercial structures gradually separate themselves.Here to the left are the ugly frame buildings--all paintedyellow--barracks, canteen, officers' quarters, hospital, commissariat,and so on. Two clumsy water-towers give height without dignity--aquality denied to military architecture in Alaska. To the right the townbegins, and an irregular row of one and two story buildings, stores,warehouses, drinking shops, straggle along the water-front.Unlike most towns in interior Alaska, Tanana does not depend upon anadjacent mining camp. It owes its existence first to its geographicalposition as the central point of interior Alaska, at the confluence ofthe Tanana and Yukon Rivers. Most of the freight and passenger trafficfor Fairbanks and the upper river is transshipped at Tanana, andextensive stocks of merchandise are maintained there. The army post isthe other important factor in the town's prosperity, and is especiallyaccountable for the number of saloons. Not only the soldiers, but manycivilian employees, are supported by the post, and when it is understoodthat three thousand cords of wood are burned annually in the militaryreservation, it will be seen that quite a number of men must find workas choppers and haulers for the wood contractors. Setting aside themaintenance of the telegraph service, which has already been referredto, it may be said without unfairness that the salient activities of thearmy in the interior of Alaska are the consumption of whisky and wood.There is no opportunity for military training--for more than six monthsin the year it is impossible to drill outdoors--and the officerscomplain of the retrogression of their men in all soldierlyaccomplishments during the two years' detail in Alaska. Whether theprosperity of the liquor dealer be in any real sense the prosperity ofthe country, and whether the rapid destruction of the forest becompensated for by the wages paid to its destroyers, may reasonably bedoubted.Three miles away is a considerable native village where the mission ofOur Saviour of the Episcopal Church is situated, with an attractivechurch building and a picturesque graveyard. The evil influence whichthe town and the army post have exerted upon the Indians finds itsultimate expression in the growth of the graveyard and the dwindling ofthe village.This point at the junction of the two rivers was an important place forthe inhabitants of interior Alaska ages before the white man reached thecountry. Tribes from all the middle Yukon, from the lower Yukon, fromthe Tanana, from the upper Kuskokwim met here for trading and forgeneral festivity. It is impossible nowadays to determine when first thewhite man's merchandise began to penetrate into this country, but it waslong before the white man came himself. Such prized and portablearticles as axes and knives passed from hand to hand and from tribe totribe over many hundreds of miles. Captain Cook, in 1778, foundimplements of white man's make in the hands of the natives of the greatinlet that was named for him after his death, and they pointed to theFar East as the direction whence they had come. He judged that they hadbeen brought from the Hudson Bay factories clean across the continent.There are many Indians still living who remember when they saw thefirst white man, and some were well grown at the time, but diligentinquiry has failed to discover one who ever saw a stone axe used, thoughsome old men have been found who declared that their fathers, whenyoung, used that implement. Traces have been discovered of theimportation of edge-tools from four directions--from the mouth of theYukon; from the Lynn Canal, by way of the headwaters of the Yukon; fromthe Prince William Sound, by way of the headwaters of the Tanana; aswell as from the Hudson Bay posts in the Canadian Northwest, by way ofthe Porcupine River.When the Russians established themselves at Nulato in 1842, and theHudson Bay Company put a post at Fort Yukon in 1846, Nuchalawóya, asTanana was called, became the scene of commercial rivalry, and it issaid that by the meeting of the agents and voyageurs of the twocompanies at this point the identity of the Yukon and Quikpak Rivers wasdiscovered.The stories that linger with the village ancients of the great numbersof Indians who used to inhabit the country are doubtless based uponrecollections of the gathering at old Nuchalawóya, when furs werebrought here from far and wide, when there was no other place ofmerchandise in mid-Alaska. Now almost every Indian village has a traderand a store. That the race has diminished, and in most places is stilldiminishing, is beyond question, but that it was ever very largelynumerous the natural conditions of the country forbid us to believe.[Sidenote: WHISKY-PEDDLERS]During the Reverend Jules Prevost's time at Tanana--and he was inresidence in the year of this journey--from careful vital statisticskept during two periods of five years each, the race seemed barely to beholding its own; but since that time there has been a considerabledecline, coincident with the increase of drunkenness and debauchery atthe village when Mr. Prevost's firm hand and watchful eye werewithdrawn. The situation tends to grow worse, and while one does notgive up hope, for that would mean to give up serious effort, the outlookfor the Indians at this place seems unfavourable. Two hundred soldiers,six or eight liquor shops,--the number varies from year to year,--threemiles off a native village of perhaps one hundred and fifty souls, anddotting those intervening miles cabins chiefly occupied by "bootleggers"and go-betweens--that is the Tanana situation in a nutshell. The mendesire the native girls, and the liquor is largely a lure to get them.Tuberculosis and venereal disease are rife, and the two make a terriblyfatal combination amongst Indians.It was good to enjoy Mr. and Mrs. Prevost's hospitality, and it was goodto speak through such an admirable interpreter as Paul. Something morethan intelligence and knowledge of the languages are required to make agood interpreter; there must be sympathy and the ability to take fire.With such an interpreter, leaping at the speaker's thoughts, carryinghimself entirely into his changing moods, rising to vehemence with himand again dropping to gentleness, forgetting himself in hisidentification with his principal, there is real pleasure in speaking tothe natives who hang upon his vicarious lips. On the other hand, one ofthe most intelligent mission interpreters in the country is also sophlegmatic in disposition, so lifeless and monotonous in his speech, andparticularly so impassive of countenance, that he reminds one ofNapoleon's saying about Talleyrand: that if some one kicked him behindwhile he was speaking to you his face would give no sign of it at all.[Sidenote: CHENA AND FAIRBANKS]It is not necessary to write much detail of the two-hundred-mile journeyto Fairbanks up the Tanana River. The trail was then wholly on theriver, but now it has been taken wholly off, as every Alaskan musherhopes some day will be done with all trails. The region about the mouthof the river and for some miles up is one of the windiest in thecountry, and there is always troublesome crossing of bare sand-bars andof ice over which sand has been blown. The journey hastens to its close;men and dogs alike realise it, and push on willingly over longer stagesthan they had before attempted.Two days from Tanana we were luxuriating in the natural hot springs nearBaker Creek, wallowing in the crude wooden vat, when "Daddy Karstner"had shovelled enough snow in to make entering the water possible, andemerging ruddy as boiled lobsters. It was a beautiful and interestingspot then, with noble groves of birch and the finest grove ofcottonwood-trees in Alaska--all cut down now--all ruined in a plungingand bounding and quite unsuccessful attempt to make a "Health Resort" ofthe place for the "smart set" of Fairbanks. It is a scurvy trick ofFortune when she gives large wealth to a man with no feeling for trees.We spent Sunday there and roamed over the curious domain, snow-freeamidst all the surrounding snow, rank in vegetation amidst theyet-lingering winter death; and then we wallowed again.Tolovana, Nenana, and then one long run of fifty-four miles, the longestand last run of the winter, and--Chena and Fairbanks. But just before wereached Chena, as we passed the fish camp where the dogs had beenboarded the previous summer, Nanook stopped the whole team, looked up atthe bank and gave utterance to his pronounced five barks on thedescending scale. None of the other dogs seemed to notice or recognisethe place, but Nanook said as plainly as if he had uttered speech:"Well, well! there's where I spent last summer!"We reached Fairbanks on the 11th of April, in time for Good Friday andEaster, after an absence of four months and a half--with the accumulatedmail of all that period awaiting me. The distance covered was abouttwenty-two hundred miles, three fourths of it on foot, more than half ofit on snow-shoes. At Chena I had called up the hospital at Fairbanks onthe telephone, and the exchange operator had immediately recognised myvoice and bidden me welcome; but when I reached Fairbanks, a light beardthat I had suffered to grow during the winter made me unrecognisable bythose who knew me best. So effectually does a beard disguise a man andso surely may his voice identify him.FOOTNOTE:[A] This was written before the writer learned the superior protectionafforded by _amber_ glass.CHAPTER VITHE "FIRST ICE"--AN AUTUMN ADVENTURE ON THE KOYUKUKIT is not attempted in this narrative to give separate account of allthe journeys with which it deals. That would involve much repetition andtedious detail. Our long journey has been described from start tofinish, taking the reader far north of the Yukon, then almost to theextreme west of Alaska, and then round by the Yukon to mid-Alaska again.It is proposed now to give sketches of such parts of other journeys asdo not cover the same ground, and they will lie, with one exception,south of the Yukon. While visiting many of the same points every winter,it has been within the author's good fortune and contrivance to includeeach year some new stretch of country, sometimes searching out andvisiting a new tribe of natives, and blazing the way for theestablishment of permanent missionary work amongst them. To theseinitial journeys belongs a zest that no subsequent travels in the sameregion ever have; there is a keen interest in what every new turn of atrail shall bring, every new bend of a river; there is eagerness risingwith one's rising steps to excitement for the view from a new mountainpass; above all, there is deep satisfaction coupled with a sense ofsolemn responsibility in being the first to reach some remote band ofIndians and preach to them the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. Thereare few men nowadays on the North American continent to whom thatprivilege remains.A period of nearly three years elapses between the beginning of thejourney that has already been described and the short sketch of ajourney that follows. Many things had happened in those three years. Ithad been the happy duty of the writer to return to the Koyukuk late inthe winter of 1906-7, empowered to build the promised mission for thehitherto neglected natives of that region. Pitching tent at a spotopposite the mouth of the Alatna, with the aid of a skilled carpenterand a couple of axemen brought from the mining district above, and thelabour of the Indians, the little log church and the mission house wereput up and prepared for the two ladies--a trained nurse and ateacher--who should arrive on the first steamboat. The steamboat thatbrought them in carried him out on its return trip, and the next yearwas spent in the States making known the needs of the work in Alaska andsecuring funds for its advancement.[Sidenote: DOCTOR GRAFTON BURKE]On my return I brought with me a young physician, Doctor Grafton Burke,as a medical missionary, and a half-breed Alaskan youth, Arthur, who hadbeen at school in California, as attendant and interpreter. Athirty-two-foot gasoline launch designed for the Yukon and itstributaries was also brought and was launched at the head of Yukonnavigation at Whitehouse. The voyages of the _Pelican_ on almost all thenavigable waters of interior Alaska do not belong to a narrativeconcerned solely with winter travel, but her maiden voyage ended in anunexpected and rather extraordinary journey over the ice which isperhaps worth describing. After the voyage down the Yukon, and up anddown the Tanana, it was purposed to take the boat up the Koyukuk to thenew mission at the Allakaket, where dogs and gear had been left, and puther in winter quarters there. The delays that associate themselves notunnaturally with three novices and a four-cylinder gasoline engine, hadbrought the date for ascending the Koyukuk a little too late for safety,though still well within the ordinary season of open water. Thepossibility of an early winter closing the navigation of that streambefore the _Pelican_ reached her destination had been entertained andprovided against, though it seemed remote. Three dogs, needed anyway toreplace superannuated members of the team, had been bargained for atTanana and accommodations for them arranged, and a supply of dog fishstowed on the after deck of the launch. But when we went to pay thearranged price and receive the dogs, the vender's wife and children setup such a remonstrance and plaintive to-do that he went back on hisbargain and we did not get the dogs. There was no time to hunt others,to linger was to invite the very mishap we sought to guard against, sowe pulled out dogless, reached the mouth of the Koyukuk on the 17th ofSeptember and, having taken on board the supply of gasoline cachedthere, turned our bow up the river the next morning. For five days wepushed up the waters of that great, lonely river, and by that time wewere some twenty-five miles above Hogatzakaket, three hundred andtwenty-five miles from the mouth and one hundred and twenty-five milesfrom the mission, at the camp of a prospector who had recently poled upfrom the Yukon. We woke on board the launch the next morning to find iceformed all around us and ice running in the river. The thermometer hadgone to zero in the night.[Sidenote: THE RUNNING ICE]A very brief attempt to make our way against the running ice showed thedanger of doing so, for the thin cakes had knife-edges and cut theplanking of the boat so that she began to leak. Then there came to mewith some bitterness that I had earnestly desired a thin steelarmour-plating at the water-line, but had allowed myself to be persuadedout of it by her builders. So again my forethought had been of noavail--though, of course, lightness of draught _was_ the firstconsideration. We put back to the camp and proceeded to flatten out andcut up all the empty cans and tinware we could find and nail it alongthe water-line of the boat, but the prospector persuaded us to wait aday or two. He had never seen a river close with the first little run ofice. He looked for a soft spell and open water yet. It was foolish torisk the boat against the ice. So we waited; and night after night thethermometer fell a little lower and a little lower, until presently asheet of ice stretched across the whole river in the bend where we lay.We were frozen in. The remote possibility we had feared and sought toguard against had happened. Navigation had ceased on the Koyukuk at theearliest date anybody remembered, the 23d of September. Three days morehad surely taken us to the mission where they had long expected us; nowwe should have to make our way on foot, without dogs, on the dangerous"first ice," as it is called, taking all sorts of chances, pulling aYukon sled, with tent and stove, grub and bedding, "by the back of theface."But first there was the launch to pull out and make snug for the winterand safe against the spring break-up. A convenient little creek mouthwith easy grade offered, which was one of the reasons I had not pushedon the few more miles we could have made. Here were eligible winterquarters; farther on we might have trouble in putting the boat insafety; here also was a kindly and capable man willing to assist us.It was our great good fortune to find this man at this spot. A steamboathe had signalled as she entered the mouth of the Koyukuk had passed himby unheeded, and he had been left to make his way six hundred miles upto the diggings, with his winter's outfit in a poling boat. He hadaccomplished more than half the task, and, warned by the approach ofwinter, had stopped at this place a few days before we reached it, andhad begun the building of a little cabin; meaning to prospect the creek,which had taken his eye as having a promising look. The cabin we helpedhim finish was the twenty-first cabin he had built in Alaska, heinformed us.There is something very impressive about the quiet, self-reliant,unrecorded hardihood of the class of which this man was an excellenttype. We asked him why he had no partner, and he said he had had severalpartners, but they all snored, and he would not live with a man thatsnored. He had prospected and mined in many districts of Alaska duringnearly twenty years. Once he had sold a claim for a few hundred dollarsthat had yielded many thousands to the purchaser, and that was as nearwealth as he had ever come. But he had always made a living, always hadenough money at the close of the summer to buy his winter's "outfit" andtry his luck somewhere else.[Sidenote: THE PROSPECTOR]Singly, or in pairs, men of this type have wandered all over this vastcountry: preceding the government surveys, preceding the professionalexplorer, settling down for a winter on some creek that caught theirfancy, building a cabin, thawing down a few holes to bed-rock, sometimestaking out a little gold, more often finding nothing, going in thesummer to some old-established camp to work for wages, or findingemployment as deck-hand on a steamboat.With an axe and an auger they have dotted their rough habitations allover the country; with a pick and a shovel and a gold pan they havetested the gravels of innumerable creeks. They know the drainage slopesand the practicable mountain passes, the haunts of the moose and thetime and direction of the caribou's wanderings. The boats they havebuilt have pushed their noses to the heads of all navigable streams; thesleds they have made have furrowed the remotest snows. In the arts ofthe wilderness they are the equal of the native inhabitant; in enduranceand enterprise far his superior. The more one learns by experience andobservation what life of this sort means, and realises the demands itmakes upon a man's resourcefulness, upon his physique, upon his goodspirits, upon his fortitude, the more one's admiration grows for thesilent, strong men who have gone out all over this land and pittedthemselves successfully against its savage wildness. Often in stress forthe necessaries of life, there are yet no men as a class morefree-handed and generous; trained to do everything for themselves, thereare none more willing to help others.It is no small task to pull a four-ton boat out of the water with onlysuch wilderness tackle as we could devise. We made ways of soft timbers,squaring and smoothing them; we cut down many trees for rollers; we dugand graded the beach. Then, having altogether unloaded her and built ahigh cache of poles and a platform for her stuff, and having chopped theice from all around her, we rigged a Spanish windlass and wound thatboat out of the water with the half-inch cable she carried, and up onthe ways and well into the mouth of the little creek. Then we levelledher up and thoroughly braced her and put her canvas cover all over her,and she lay there until spring and took no harm at all.Arthur had meantime been making a sled of birch, intending to pull ithimself while the doctor and I pulled a Yukon sled borrowed from ourfriend the prospector. By the 6th of October all our dispositions weremade for departure, and the ice seemed strong enough to warrant trustingourselves to it; but we waited another two days, the thermometer stillreaching a minimum each night somewhere around zero. When we saidgood-bye to our friend Martin Nelson (sometimes one wonders if anywhereelse in the world can be found men as kind and helpful to strangers) andstarted on our journey, it soon appeared that Arthur's sled was morehindrance than help. There was no material to iron the runners savestrips of tin can, and these could not be beaten so smooth that they didnot drag and cut on the ice. So the load was transferred to our sled andthe little sled abandoned, and we took turns at the harness. This wasthe order of the journey: one man went ahead with an axe to test theice; one man put the rope trace about his shoulders; one man pushed atthe handle-bars which had been affixed to the sled. It was fortunatethat amidst the equipment on the launch were two pairs of ice-creepers.Without them any sort of pulling and pushing on the glare ice would havebeen impossible.We soon found that the bend in which we had frozen was no sort of indexof the general condition of the river. Much of it was still wide open,and every elbow between bends was piled high with rough ice frompressure jams. There was shore ice, however, even in the open bends,along which we were able to creep; and, though the ice-jams gaveconsiderable trouble, yet we did very well the first day and camped atdark with eighteen or nineteen miles to our credit, in the presence of agreat, red, smoky sunset and a glorious alpenglow on a distant snowmountain.The next day was full of risks and difficulties. We were to learn moreabout the varieties and vagaries of ice on that journey than manywinters' travel on older ice would teach.[Illustration: THE START OVER THE "FIRST ICE."][Illustration: "ROUGH GOING."][Sidenote: THE START]At times, for a few hundred yards, the sled would glide with littleeffort over smooth, polished ice; then would come a long sand-bar, theside of which we had to hug close, and the ice upon it was what iscalled "shell-ice," through several layers of which we broke at everystep. As the river fell, each night had left a thin sheet of iceunderneath the preceding night's ice, and the foot crashed through thelayers and the sled runners cut through them down to the gravel and sandat the bottom. Then would come another smooth stretch on which we madegood time. But as we advanced up the river the current was swifter andswifter and the ice conditions grew steadily worse. Here was a steep-cutbank with just about eighteen or twenty inches of ice adhering to it andthe black, rushing water beyond. We must either get our load along thatshelf or unload the sled and pack everything over the face of a rockybluff. Arthur passed over it first, testing gently with the axe, andfound it none too strong. But the alternative was so toilsome that weresolved to take the chance. The doctor put the trace over hisshoulders, Arthur took the handle-bars, while I climbed to a ledge ofthe rocks and, with a rope made of a pair of camel's-hair putteesunwound for the purpose and fastened to the sled, took all the weight Icould and eased the sled over the worst place where the ice sloped tothe water. If the ice had broken I might have held the sled from sinkinguntil one of the others came to me, or I might not; the boys wouldprobably have gone in too. It was a most risky spot and the sort ofchance no one would think of taking under ordinary circumstances. As itwas, the ice broke under Arthur's feet, and only by throwing his weighton the sled did he save himself a ducking. But we got the load safelyacross.A good run of perhaps a mile, and then we had to go back at least half amile, for the ice played out altogether on our side of the river as wereached the Batzakaket, and there was open water in the middle. To reachthe shore ice that was continuous on the other side, we had to "double"the open water. With such varying fortune the day passed, and we campedon the level ice of a little creek tributary to the right bank, havingmade perhaps another nineteen miles.When I awoke in the morning my heart sank at the tiny, creeping patterof fine snow on the silk tent. Snow was one thing I greatly dreaded, forthere was not a pair of snow-shoes amongst us! A little snow would notdo much harm, but if once snow began to fall we might have a foot or twobefore it ceased, and then we should be in bad case. It stopped beforenoon, but the half-inch that fell made the sled drag much heavier. Theactual force to be exerted was not the most laborious feature of pullingthat sled; it was the jerk, jerk, jerk on the shoulders. A dog's fourlegs give him much smoother traction than a man's two legs give, just asa four-cylinder engine will turn a propeller with much less vibrationthan a two-cylinder engine. Every step forward gave an impulse thatspent itself before the next impulse was given, and the result was thatthe shoulders grew sore.We came that morning to the longest and roughest ice-jam we had so farencountered. It was as though a thousand bulls had been turned loose ina mammoth plate-glass warehouse. Jagged slabs of ice upended everywherein the most riotous confusion, and it was impossible to pick any wayamongst them, so a man had to go ahead and hew a path. It was while thusengaged that the doctor fell and injured his knee so severely on a sharpice point that he hobbled in pain the rest of the trip. This was a veryserious matter to us, for, though he insisted on still taking his trickat the traces, his effectiveness as a motive power was much diminished;and we had no sooner thus hewed and smashed our way through that jamthan we had to hew and smash it across to the other side again in oursearch for passage.[Sidenote: "BY THE BACK OF THE FACE"]Then we came to a place where, in order to cut off a long sweeping curveof the river with open water and bad shore ice, we went through a dryslough and had to drag those iron runners over gravel and stones, wheresometimes it was all the three of us could do to move the sled a fewfeet at a time. Yet all along the banks were willows, and if we had onlyknown then what we know now we would have cut down and split somesaplings and bound them over the iron, and so have saved three fourthsof that labour.[Sidenote: BEAR MEAT AND BEANS]So the day's run was short, though the most exhausting yet, and we wereall thoroughly tired out when we pitched the tent. I have note of agreat supper of bear meat and beans, the meat the spoil of our friendthe prospector's gun. It is one of the compensations of human naturethat the satisfaction of appetite increases in pleasure in proportion tothe bodily labour that is done. With food abundant and at choice, I donot like bear meat and will not eat beans. Yet my diary bears specialnote of the delicious meal they furnished on this occasion. Put anyphilosopher in the traces, or set him ahead of the dog team onshow-shoes, breaking trail all day, and towards evening it is odds thathis mind is not occupied with deep speculations about the infinite andthe absolute, but rather with the question of what he will have forsupper. Particularly should the grub be a little short, should freshmeat give out, or, above all, should sugar be "shy," it is astonishinghow one's mind runs on eating and what elaborate imaginary repasts onepartakes of. Yet of all food that a man ever eats there is none that isso relished and gives such clear gustatory pleasure as the plain, roughfare of the camp--provided it be well cooked. Greatly as we were in needof sleep, we got little, for the doctor's knee pained him all night andpoor Arthur developed a raging toothache that did not yield untilcarbolic acid had been thrice applied.Soon after we started the next day, the river narrowed and swept round aseries of mountain bluffs and we began to have the gloomiestexpectations of trouble. It seemed certain that ice would fail us forpassage, and we would have to pack our sled and its load by slow relaysover the mountain. But to our delight we passed between the bluffs ongood, firm, smooth ice, and it was not until we emerged on the flatbeyond that our difficulty began. So it is again and again on the trail.Almost always it is the unexpected that happens; almost always it issomething quite different from what our apprehensions have dwelt uponthat arises to hinder and distress us. A tongue of level land thatstruck far out into the water, a cut mud bank with a current so swiftthat no ice at all had formed along it, interposed an obstacle that ittook hours to circumvent. We had to leave the sled and cut a trailthrough the brush for half a mile along this peninsula in order to reacha stretch of the river where the ice was resumed, and the little snowthat had fallen being quite insufficient to give the sled good passage,we had an exceedingly arduous job in getting it across.A mile or two of good going brought us in view of the smoke of a humanhabitation. What a blessed sight often and often this waving column ofblue smoke in the distance is! Sometimes it means life itself to theAlaskan musher, and it always means warmth, shelter, food,companionship, assistance; all that one human being can bring toanother. "The bright and the balmy effulgence of morn" never "breaks onthe traveller faint and astray" with half the rejoicing that comes withthe first sight of mere smoke. "I believe I see smoke," cried Arthur,with the quick vision of the native. "Where? Where?" we eagerlyinquired, and the doctor left the handle-bars and limped forward to theboy ahead with the axe. "Away yonder on that bank," pointed Arthur. "Isee it! I see it!" the doctor shouted; "we're coming to a house, we'recoming to people!" The trip was a severe apprenticeship to Alaskan lifefor a man straight from the New York hospitals, although before theaccident to his knee I had declared that if only they could be trainedto live on dry fish I thought a team of young doctors would haul a sledvery well. He was delighted at coming upon the first inhabited house wehad seen since we helped Nelson to build his little cabin--and _that_was only the second inhabited house in three hundred miles.[Sidenote: BREAKING THROUGH]But, perhaps because we grew less cautious in our excitement, almostimmediately after we had spied the smoke of the cabin we got into one ofthe worst messes of the whole trip. Arthur had pushed ahead and we hadfollowed with a spurt, and almost at the same time all three of usbecame aware that we were on dangerous ice. Arthur cried, "The ice isbreaking; go back!" just as we began to feel it swaying under our feet.I shouted to the doctor, "Go _on_ to the bank quick!" and pushed withall my might, and we managed to make a few yards more towards shallowwater, over ice that bent and cracked at every step, before it gave wayand let down the sled and the men into two feet of water. Arthur had runsafely over the breaking ice and had gained the bank, and as I write, inmy mind's eye I can see the doctor, who had been duly instructed in theelementary lessons of the trail, standing in the water and calling toArthur: "Make a fire quick; make a fire. I'm all wet!"But it was not necessary to make a fire, for the thermometer was nolower than 10° or 15° above zero, and the chief trouble was not thewetting of our legs but the wetting of the contents of the sled. Alongthe bank was stronger ice, and we managed, though not without muchdifficulty, to get the sled upon it and to make our way to the Indiancabin.As soon as old "Atler" (I have never been quite sure of what whiteman's name that is a corruption) knew who we were, his hospitality,which had been ready enough at first sight, became most cordial andexpansive. While we pulled off our wet clothing his wife hung it up todry and had the kettle on and some tea making, and he and Arthur got outour wet bedding and festooned it about the cabin. Most fortunately thethings that would have suffered most from water did not get wet. Sothere we lay all the afternoon, having made no more than six miles, andthere we lay all the next day, which was Sunday.There was a sort of awful interest that centred upon one member of thisfamily, a boy of seven or eight years. The previous spring he had killedhis uncle by the accidental discharge of a .22 rifle, shooting himthrough the heart. The gun had been brought in loaded and cocked and hadbeen set in a corner of the cabin, and the child, playing with it, hadpulled the trigger. The carelessness of Indians with firearms is thefrequent cause of terrible accidents like this. The child was still tooyoung to realise what he had done, but one fancies that later it willthrow a gloom on his life.To my great relief and satisfaction I was able to arrange here for ayoung Indian man to accompany us with his one dog. He was a native ofthose parts and knew every bend and turn of the river. We were, indeed,in great need of help. The doctor's knee grew worse rather than better,and Arthur was suffering the return of an old rheumatism in his leg. Iwas the only sound member of the party, and my shoulders were galled bythe rope and my feet tender and sore from continual wearing of thecrampons. We were now not quite half-way--some sixty miles lay behind usand sixty-five before--and we had been travelling four days.[Sidenote: "ONE-EYED WILLIAM"]Divine service being done on Sunday morning, the whole of it wellinterpreted by Arthur to the great satisfaction of the Indians, he and"One-Eyed William," our recruit, started out to survey to-morrow'sroute. In this reconnaissance William broke through some slush ice atthe greatest depth of the river in seeking a safe place to cross, and,had Arthur not been with him, would almost certainly have drowned, forthe current was very swift and the man, like most Indians, unable toswim a stroke;--though, indeed, swimming is of little avail for escapeout of such predicament and is a poor dependence in these icy waterswinter or summer. More beans boiled and a batch of biscuits bakedagainst our departure, and evening prayer said and interpreted, we wereready for bed again.Our visit was a great delight to old Atler. An inflamed eye was muchrelieved by the doctor's ministrations, and the natural piety which heshares with most Indians was gratified at the opportunity of worship andinstruction. A good old man, according to his lights, I take Atler tobe, well known for benevolence of disposition and particularly pridinghimself on being a friend of the white man. He told us of one unworthyrepresentative of that race he had helped a year ago. The man had comeout of the Hogatzitna (Hog River) country, entirely out of food, himselfand a couple of dogs nigh to starvation, and Atler had taken care of himfor several days while he recuperated and had given him grub and dogfish enough to get him to Bettles, one hundred and thirty miles away,where he could purchase supplies. The old Indian had robbed his ownfamily's little winter stock of "white-man's grub" that this strangermight be provided, and had never heard a word from him since, though hehad promised to make return when he reached Bettles.Unfortunately Alaska's white population is sprinkled with men like this,men without heart and without conscience, and it is precisely suchrascals who are loudest in their contemptuous talk of the Indians. It issuch men who chop down the woodwork of cabins rather than be troubled totake the axe into the forest a few rods away, who depart in the morningwithout making kindling and shavings, careless how other travellers mayfare so themselves be warm without labour; who make "easy money" in thesummer-time by dropping down the Yukon with a boat-load of "rot-gut"whisky, leaving drunkenness and riot at every village they pass; whobeget children of the native women and regard them no more than a dogdoes his pups, indifferent that their own flesh and blood go cold andhungry. They are the curse and disgrace of Alaska, and they often golong time insolent and unwhipped because our poor lame law is not nimbleenough to overtake them; "to whom is reserved the blackness of darknessfor ever," one's indignation is sometimes disposed to thunder savagelywith Saint Jude; and indeed there needs a future punishment to redressthe balance in this country.[Sidenote: FIDO]At break of day our reinforced company was off, Arthur and "One-EyedWilliam" going ahead to sound the ice and pick the way, the dog "Fido"(such a name for a Siwash dog!) and myself in the traces, the doctor atthe handle-bars. The rest had benefited the doctor's knee, but walkingwas still painful and he needed the support of the handle-bars all day.What a great difference that one strong, willing little dog made! Hissteady pulling kept the sled in motion and relieved one's shoulders ofthe galling jerk of the rope at every step. The going was "not too bad,"as they say here, all day, though it carried one rather severedisappointment. William had told us of a portage he thought we couldtake that would cut off eight or nine miles of the river; but when wereached it the snow upon it proved insufficient to afford a passage, forit was a rough niggerhead flat, and we had to swing around the outeredges of the great curves the river makes, where alone was ice, withtrouble and danger at every crossing.The decision as to whether we should halt or go forward, as to whetherice was safe or unsafe, as to whether we should cross the river or staywhere we were--every decision that concerned the secure advance of theparty--I put wholly upon William, and would not permit myself or anyother to question his judgment or to argue it with him. There was nosense in half-measures; this young man knew the river as none of us did,knew ice as none of us did, and we must put ourselves entirely in hishands. The debate that had become usual at every doubtful course aroseat the portage just referred to, but it was at once suppressed by theannouncement that hereafter no one could have the floor but William, andthat when he had spoken the matter was settled. Day by day I think weall came to a keener realisation of how very dangerous a journey we weremaking; it lay heavily on my mind that I had brought these two youngmen--whether by mishap or mismanagement--into real peril of their lives.Again and again I blamed myself for the delays that had deferred ourstart up the Koyukuk, again and again I wished that we had waited longerbefore leaving the _Pelican's_ winter quarters. I had even contemplateda week's stay at Atler's, to give the river a chance to get into bettershape, but unless there came a very much sharper spell than we had hadso far a week would not make much difference, and our grub began to runshort and Atler was none too well supplied. So it seemed best to pushon.The next day was full of toil and difficulty. There was no good ice tomake fine time over that day. Starting in the grey dawn, for mile aftermile we had to haul the sled over crumbly shell-ice that broke throughto gravel; and when the shell-ice was done we came to a new bend where arapid current washed a steep mud bank. There was just a little shelf ofice, but the brush overhung it so that the passage of the sled was notpossible. William and Arthur started with the axes to clear away thebrush, but it seemed to me foolish to do that unless the ledge held outand led somewhere, for the turn of the bank threw it out of sight. Sothey went forward cautiously along that ledge to the end--and an endthey found, sure enough, so that had we followed the axemen with thesled we should have had to creep all the way back again. There wasnothing for it but to cut another land trail on a bench that we couldreach where the sled was stopped but that could not be reached at allfarther on. A long and slow and laborious job it was, that took most ofthe morning, to cut that trail and then get the load over it to iceagain.By noon we were opposite the Red Mountain, one of the well-known Koyukuklandmarks, and on the site of an old Indian fishing camp. William andArthur had made a great fire when we came up, and we heated some beansand made some tea and ate lunch. A mile farther on was the cabin of awhite man, and we paid him a brief visit and got a little tea from him,for ours was nearly gone. It did me good to hear him sing the praises ofDeaconess Carter, the trained nurse at the mission. She had taken himin, crippled with rheumatism, and had cured him. Already the new missionwas proving a boon to whites as well as natives. We made no more thanfour or five miles farther when, coming to spruce with no more in sightfor a long distance, we pitched the tent, all very tired.That night the thermometer went to 5° below zero, the coldest weather ofthe season so far. As a consequence the next day we had a new and verydisagreeable trouble. The cold weather, by increasing the amount ofrunning ice in the still open stretches, had brought about a jam thathad raised the level of the water and caused an overflow of the ice--avery common phenomenon of a closing river. We picked our way wet-footmuch of the day, and towards evening came to a complete _impasse_ in themiddle of the river, with open water in front and on one hand, and newthin ice on the other. So we had to turn round and go back again a longway, the mid-river being the only traversable place, until, when itseemed that we should have to go round another bend to reach a crossing,Arthur proposed that he and William, who wore mukluks, should carry thedoctor and me, who wore moccasins across the overflow, and then rush thesled across; and this we did, wetting its contents somewhat, however. Wecamped immediately, for we had landed on impassable gravel.[Sidenote: THE RED MOUNTAIN]That night the thermometer went to 20° below zero, and we took good hopethat the cold, which began to approach the real cold of winter, wouldput an end to overflow; but, on the contrary, it only aggravated thetrouble. For the first mile or two there was nothing for it but to gothrough it, and at 20° below it is a miserable business to be wading inmoccasins even for an hour. We had rearranged our load so that it stoodup somewhat higher, but we could not avoid wetting the things on thebottom of the sled, and the ice formed about it very inconveniently.Moreover, the little dog, who had a great dislike to wetting his feet,began to give us a good deal of trouble, and at one time nothing but theadmirable presence of mind and prompt action of William saved us fromlosing our whole load. We had reached a strip of new, dry ice formed thenight before, with black, rushing water on the left, towards which theslippery surface sloped. Presently as we advanced we began to encountera little overflow water, coming from the bank on the right, seeping upbetween the ice and the bank; and that dog, to avoid wetting his feet inthe overflow, deliberately turned towards the open water and set thesled sliding in the same direction. Without the crampons, which we hadnot used for the past few days, it was impossible to hold the sledagainst the dog's traction, and in another moment we should have losteverything, for the dog paid no heed to our voices, when William with ablow of his axe cut the rope by which the dog pulled, and, grasping thesled and throwing himself full length on the ice, managed to stop it onthe very brink of the water. It was a close shave, but once more we weresafe; and the doctor, in the exuberance of his gratitude, said thatnight: "If William wants a glass eye I'll send to New York to get himone." But when William learned that the glass eye was a mere matter oflooks and would in no wise improve his vision, he lost interest in it.Looks do not count for much amongst the Koyukuk Indians.[Illustration: ARTHUR AND DOCTOR BURKE.][Illustration: SAINT JOHN'S-IN-THE-WILDERNESS, ALLAKAKET, KOYUKUKRIVER.]That night was a long way off yet, however; we had other risks to run,other labours. Here were two islands in the river, and the current,running like a mill-race and burdened with ice cakes, swept around theshore of one of them leaving the passage between them quite dry. Therewas no shore ice at all where the channel was, and it was sougly-looking a reach that had there been any there I am sure we shouldnot have ventured it. There was nothing for it but to drag the sled halfa mile over the gravel, and we did it, the most heart-breaking labourof the whole trip. It took us exactly an hour to make that half mile.William did not know the trick of the split willows either, so we allfour of us sweated for our ignorance. Shortly after, our guide pointedout the spot where poor Ericson's frozen body was found, two years andeight months before.[Sidenote: A NARROW ESCAPE][Sidenote: RUBBER ICE]Near the Kornuchaket (or the mouth of Old Man Creek), where the Koyukukreceives a considerable tributary, we approached the most dangeroustravelling we had had yet. The river here is swift and deep, and thereare several islands set in it. Most of its surface was frozen, but theice was very thin. William stopped the procession before we reached thebad stretch and went hastily over a part of it. Under his single weightwe could see the ice-sheet undulating. It had been our rule that ice wasnot safe unless it took three blows of the axe to bring water, but thisice gave water at a blow. When William returned he made quite anharangue, which Arthur interpreted. He thought we could make it past themouth of the creek, and if we could we should find good going to Moses'Village. But we must go just as fast as we could travel; we must not letthe sled stop an instant. The ice would bend and crack; but he thoughtif we went quickly we could get across. So for nearly a quarter of amile we rushed that sled over "rubber" ice that swayed and cracked andyielded under our feet and under the sled, until we reached the bank ofone of the islands, and then again we launched her and ran with her tothe shore. Once one of my feet broke through, and immediately the waterwelled up all around--with the steamboat channel underneath--butwithout pause we increased our speed and made the strong shore icesafely at last. No man will ever doubt the plasticity, the "viscosity"of ice, as it used to be styled in the old glacier controversies, whohas passed over the "rubber" ice that forms under certain circumstancesand at certain seasons on these rivers.We would never, I am sure, have attempted that ice had not William beenwith us. We would have struck a blow with the axe and declared itunsafe. Of course, it was unsafe; the whole journey was unsafe, but I amconvinced that this thin, continuous sheet of ice, cushioned actuallyupon the surface of the water out of which it was growing, was reallysafer than much of the thicker but brittle, unsupported ice we hadunhesitatingly come over. Chemists tell us that certain substances inthe act of formation, which they call nascent substances, areextraordinarily active and potent, and it may be that ice in the samestate has a special tenacity of texture which belongs to that statealone. I wish that I could have measured the thickness of that ice.Where my foot went through I know it was very thin, but its thickness Iwill not venture to guess. There was the distinct feeling that the waterwas bearing the ice up and when it was punctured the water welled upwith pressure behind it.Beyond the Kornuchaket much more snow had fallen, and a few milesbrought us to Moses' Village, called grandiosely "Arctic City," since atrader had established a store and a road-house there. At this spot anew overland mail trail from Tanana strikes the Koyukuk, and, althoughten or twelve miles remained, we felt that our journey was done. My sleddogs were there, and, as I had not seen them for more than a year, thatwas a joyful reunion. Nanook's bark of welcome, which no one but I evergot with quite the same inflection, was as grateful to me as all thelicking and slobbering of the others, for Nanook is a very independentbeast, reserved in his demonstrations and not wearing his heart on hissleeve, so to speak. They were all glad to see me--Old Lingo and Nig,and even "Jimmy the Fake." Billy was dead. For fifteen or sixteen monthsthey had been boarded here, and, since fish had been very scarce thepreceding summer, their food had been chiefly bacon and rice and tallow,and there was a bill of close to four hundred dollars against us! Dogsare very expensive things in this expensive country. When used thewinter through on the trail, and boarded the summer through at a fishcamp, we estimate that it costs one hundred dollars per head per annumto feed a dog; so that the maintenance of a team of five dogs, which isthe minimum practicable team, will cost five hundred dollars per annumfor food alone.[Sidenote: SATURATED SNOW]When we had eaten a good supper and were reclining on spring cots in thebunk house, there was not one of us but confidently expected to be atthe mission in the next forenoon. For a week past the natives had beengoing to and fro in three or four hours. The river was completely closedabove here, and there was much more snow than we found below. So wehitched our own dogs to our own sled the next morning, when the doctorhad visited a sick person or two, and started out on the last stretchof the journey. All went well until we had turned the long bend at thehead of which the old, abandoned post of Bergman is situated, just onthe Arctic Circle, but a mile or two beyond we were wallowing insaturated snow that stretched all across the river right up to the bankson either side. An overflow was in progress, the water running along thesurface of the ice and soaking up the snow so that there was six inchesof slush all over it. We struggled along awhile, though from the firstit seemed hopeless, and then we gave it up and went back to theroad-house. There would be no passing that stretch of river with thesled until the cold had dealt with the overflow. It is almost always theunexpected that happens. The next morning I put on a pair ofsnow-shoes--Doctor Burke's knee forbade him their use--and takingWilliam with me, mushed up through the slush and the snow to themission, leaving the others to come on with the team so soon as theyfound it practicable.A mile before we reached the mission was the new village built by theEsquimaux--"Kobuk town" they call it--and right in front of the villagethe Malamute Riffle, a noted difficulty of navigation, was still runningwide open, though all the rest of the river was long closed. Near theriffle the Kobuks had a fish-trap, and some who were busy getting outfish saw and recognised me, and the whole population came swarming outfor greetings. It was good to see these kindly, simple people again, toshake their hands and hear their "I glad I see you," which is thegeneral native greeting where there is any English at all. Every onemust shake hands; even the babies on their mothers' backs stretch outtheir little fingers eagerly, and if they be too small for that, themother will take the little hand and hold it out. At the bend we take aportage and a quarter of a mile brings us to the Allakaket, to thefamiliar modest buildings of the mission, with its new Koyukuk villagegradually clustering round it. The whole scene was growing into almostthe exact realisation of my dream when first I camped on this spot twoyears and nine months before. There was a distinct thrill of pleasure atthe sight of the church. Built entirely of logs with the bark on, therewas nothing visible anywhere about it but spruce bark, save for thegleam of the gilded cross that surmounted the little belfry. The roof,its regular construction finished, was covered with small spruce poleswith the bark on, nailed together at the apex, and where it projectedwell beyond the gables its under-side was covered with bark, as well asthe cornice all round that finished it off. Even the window-frames andthe door-panels were covered with bark. It was of the same tone becauseof the selfsame substance as the forest still growing around it, and itgave at the first glance the satisfied impression of fitness. It gavethe feeling that it belonged where it was placed. It is ill praisingone's own work, but I had been keen to see how it would strike me, freshfrom the outside, after a year's absence, and I was very glad indeedthat it pleased me again.[Sidenote: A STARVING WHITE MAN]I had no more than entered upon the warm welcome that waited at SaintJohn's-in-the-Wilderness, and was still wondering at the homelikecosiness which the mission house had assumed under the deft hands ofthe two ladies who occupied it, when there came an Indian with word of awhite man he had found starving in the wilderness fifteen miles away.Another native with a dog team and a supply of immediate food washastily despatched to bring the man in, and that night the pooremaciated fellow, looking like a man of sixty-five or seventy though hewas really no more than forty, crawled out of the sled and tottered intothe house. He had started out from Tanana two months before with twopack-horses to make his way across to the Koyukuk diggings, had lost hisway and wandered aimlessly in that vast wilderness; one horse had beendrowned, the other he had killed for meat. He had made a raft to comedown the Kornutna (Old Man Creek) to the Koyukuk, knowing that there wasa trading-post near its mouth, and had been frozen in and forced toabandon it. Since that time he had been living on a few spoonfuls ofmeal a day, with frozen berries, and once or twice a ptarmigan, and whenNed found him was at the last extremity and had given up, intending todie where he was.That man's hunger was tremendous, but Miss Carter, having knowledge andexperience of such cases, was apprehensive that if any large quantity offood were taken at a time there would be serious danger to him. So for aday or two he ate frequently but sparingly. A little later, as he grewstronger, to such extremes did his hunger pinch him that he would watchtill there was no one looking and would go into the kitchen and stealfood that was preparing, even taking it out of the frying-pan on thestove. He would be hungry immediately after having a full meal. In tendays he was sufficiently recovered to resume his journey to thediggings, and when I saw him at Coldfoot two months later I did notrecognise him, so greatly had he changed from the poor shrunken creaturethat crept into the mission. We all think we have been hungry time andagain; if ever we have gone a few days on short rations we are quitesure of it; this man had sounded the height and depth and stretched thelength and breadth of it, and none of the rest of us really know whathunger means. I tried to get him to talk about it, but he said he wantedto forget it. He said he was ashamed to think of some of the things hehad done and of some of the terrible thoughts that had come to him, andI pressed him no more. I have always felt that, even in its lasthideousness of cannibalism, only God Himself can judge starvation.[Sidenote: TWO INTERPRETERS]Here began my first experience of the difficulties of conducting amission at the same place for two different races of natives speakingtotally different languages. Although the Indian language spoken here isthe same as at Tanana, and much of the liturgy, etc., had been put intothat tongue by Mr. Prevost and was therefore available, yet it was foundimpracticable to have two sets of services whenever the church was used,for both races would always attend anyway. Since the mastery of the twotongues was out of the question, and there were no translations at allinto the Esquimau, it became a question of teaching the Esquimaux totake part in an Indian service or dropping both vernaculars altogetherand conducting the service in English. After much doubt and experimentthe latter was resolved upon, and the whole service of prayer and praiseis in English. When the lessons are read and the address delivered it isnecessary to use two interpreters; the minister delivers his sentence inEnglish, then the Koyukuk interpreter puts it in Indian, and when he isdone the Esquimau interpreter puts it into that tongue.It is a very tedious business, this double interpretation and atwenty-minute sermon takes fully an hour to deliver, but there is nohelp for it. The singing is hearty and enthusiastic though the repertoryis wisely very limited; and here, north of the Arctic Circle, is avested choir of eight or ten Kobuk and Koyukuk boys who lead the singingand lead it very well.Already the influence of the mission and the school was very marked.Given the native off by himself like this, in the hands of those in whomhe has learned to place entire confidence, remote from debasingagencies, and his improvement is evident and his survival assured.[Illustration: THE DOUBLE INTERPRETATION AT THE ALLAKAKET.][Illustration: THE WIND-SWEPT YUKON WITHIN THE RAMPARTS.]In two days the doctor and Arthur and the team came up, and so wasbrought to a happy conclusion a perilous journey over the first ice. Oneis often glad to have had experiences that one would by no means repeat,and this is a case in point. We had learned a good deal about ice; wehad taken liberties with ice that none of us had ever thought beforecould be taken with impunity; we had learned to trust ice and at thesame time to distrust it and in some measure to discriminate about it.The "last ice" is bad, but the "first ice" is much worse, and allthree of us were agreed that we wanted no more travelling over it and nomore pulling of a sled "by the back of the face."Then followed a very happy, busy time of several weeks while the riverice was consolidating and the land trails establishing; happy with itsmanifold evidences of the rapid advance the natives were making underMiss Carter's able and beneficent sway, busy with the instruction ofpeople eager to learn. It was busy and happy for Doctor Burke also; busywith the many ailments he relieved, happy with the beginnings of anattachment which two years later culminated in his marriage to MissCarter's colleague at this mission.CHAPTER VIITHE KOYUKUK TO THE YUKON AND TO TANANA--CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS AT SAINTJOHN'S-IN-THE-WILDERNESSLEAVING Fort Yukon on the 26th of November, 1909, and going again overalmost the same route we followed during the first journey described inthis volume, we reached the new mission at the Allakaket on the KoyukukRiver on the 14th of December, after a period of almost continual cold.The climate of the interior of Alaska varies as much as any climate. Theprevious year, continuing the journey described in "The First Ice," Ihad passed over this same route in the opposite direction, between thesame dates, with the thermometer well above zero the whole time. Thistrip the _mean_ of the minimum reading at night, the noon reading, andthe reading at start and finish of each day's journey was -38 1/4°. Manydays in that three weeks we travelled all day at 45° and 50° below zero,and we spent one night in camp at 49° below.It was the beginning of a severe winter, with much snow north of theYukon and long periods of great cold.[Sidenote: BIRTH, BURIAL, AND DANCING]The two weeks or so spent at the mission of SaintJohn's-in-the-Wilderness was enjoyed as only a rest is enjoyed aftermaking such a journey; as only Christmas is enjoyed at such a nativemission. It is the time of the whole year for the people; they come infrom near and far intent upon the festival in both of its aspects,religious and social, and they enter so heartily into all that isprovided for them that one does not know which to admire most, theirsimple, earnest piety or the whole-hearted enthusiasm of their sportsand pastimes. Right out of church they go to the frozen river, old menand maidens, young men and matrons, mothers with babies on their backsand their skirts tucked up, and they quickly line up and are kicking thefootball stuffed with moose hair and covered with moose hide in thenative game that their forefathers played ages before "Rugby" wasinvented.[B] When the church-bell rings, back they all troop again, totake their places and listen patiently and reverently to the long,double-interpreted service, the babies still on their mothers' backs,sometimes asleep, sometimes waking up and crying, comforted by slingingthem round and applying their lips to the fountain of nourishment andsolace.On the nights when there is no church service there is feasting anddancing. The native dance is a very simple affair, entirely without anyobjectionable feature, and one cannot see any reason in the world forattempting to suppress it. A man and a woman get out in the middle ofthe floor and dance opposite one another without touching at all. Themoccasined toes of an expert man in this dance move with surprisingrapidity, the woman, with eyes downcast, the picture of demureness,sways slightly from side to side and moves on her toes in rhythm to theman's movement. Presently another man jumps up and the first man yieldshis place; then another woman comes forward and the first woman yieldsher place, and so the dance goes on.For a variety, of late years there is an occasional "white-man's dance,"of the quadrille or the waltz kind, but the natives much prefer theirown dancing. Here at the Allakaket the presence of the Esquimaux addspicturesqueness and strangeness, and the Esquimau dance, which consistsof a series of jerky attitudinisings, with every muscle tense, to acurious monotonous chant and the beating of a drum, is a never-failingsource of amusement to the Indians.An old man's funeral in the morning away up on the high bluffoverlooking the mission, a birth in the evening, a dance the samenight--so goes the drama of life in this little, isolated native world.So soon as these people make up their minds that one of their number issick unto death they make the coffin, for when trees must be felled andlumber whipsawed from them, it is well to be forehanded.[Sidenote: "BEFORE" AND "AFTER"]There is one old woman living up there yet whose coffin had been madethree times. When it becomes evident that the unfavourable prognosis wasmistaken the coffin is torn apart and made into shelves or some otherarticle of household utility. It seems very cold-blooded, but it is easyto misjudge these people. The emotion of grief is real with them, Ibelieve, but transient. They are matter-of-fact and entirely devoid ofpretence, and when once a funeral has taken place and the service isall over they dismiss the gloomy event from their minds as soon aspossible. The night of old Mesuk's death, however, there were fireslighted on all the trails and before most of the Esquimau cabins, theobject of which was probably to frighten the spirit away from thedwellings of the living. We shall get the better of these superstitionsby and by, but superstitions die hard, not only amongst Esquimaux.Moreover, practices like this linger as traditional practices long aftertheir superstitious content is dissipated, and men of feeling do notwantonly lay hands on ancient traditional custom. I think that if I werean Esquimau and knew that from immemorial antiquity fires had beenlighted on the trails and outside the doors upon the death of myancestors, I should be tempted to kindle them myself upon an occasion,however firmly I held the Communion of Saints and the Safe Repose of theBlessed. And I am quite sure that if I were a Thlinket I should set up atotem-pole despite all the missionaries in the world. When one comes tothink about it dispassionately, there is really nothing in Christianityaverse to the kindling of corpse fires or the blazoning of nativeheraldry. When all the little superstitions and peculiar picturesquecustoms are abolished out of the world it will be a much lessinteresting world than it is to-day. If there were any evidence orreason to believe that morality and religion will be furthered by thebrow-beating or cajoling of the little peoples into a close similitudeof the white race in dress and manners and customs, all otherconsiderations would, of course, be swallowed up in a glad welcome ofsuch advance. But almost the exact opposite is true. The young Indian orEsquimau, who by much mixing with white men has been "wised up," as theexpressive phrase goes here, is commonly one of the least useful, theleast attractive, the least moral of his kind. We have many such on theYukon--young men who work on the steamboats in the summer and do oddjobs and hang around the stores in winter, and will not condescend tofish any more or to hunt or trap unless driven by the pinch of hunger.Show me an Indian who affects the white man in garb, in speech, ingeneral habits, and external characteristics, and it will be easy toshow an Indian whose death would be little loss to his community or hisrace; while the native woman who aspires to dress herself like a whitewoman has very commonly the purpose of attracting the attention of thewhite men. I think the young Indian man I recall as the best dressed,most debonair, and most completely "civilised," was living in idlenessupon the bounty of the white trader whom every one knew to be his wife'sparamour, and was impudently careless of the general knowledge.Of all the photographs that illustrate missionary publications--and Ihave contributed enough villainous half-tones to warrant me in acriticism--the ones I dislike most are of the "Before and After" type.Here is a group of savages clad in skins, or furs, or feathers, or palmfibre, or some patient, skilful weave of native wool or grass; in eachcase clad congruously with their environment and out of the products itaffords. Set against it is the same or a similar group clad out of theslop-shop, clad in hickory shirts and blue-jean trousers, clad so that,if faces could be changed as easily as clothing, they would pass for anycommonplace group of whites anywhere. And, as if such change were initself the symbol and guarantee of a change from all that is brutal andidolatrous to all that is gentle and Christian, there follows thetriumphant "Before and After" inscription. All the fitness has gone, allthe individuality, all the clever adaptation of indigenous material, allthe artistic and human interest; and a self-conscious smirk ofsuperiority radiates over made-by-the-million factory garments instead.Whenever I see such contrasting photographs there comes over me ashamed, perverse recollection of a pair of engravings by Hogarth,usually suppressed, which a London bookseller once pulled out of aportfolio in the back room of his shop and showed me. They bore the sametitle.I profess myself a friend of the native tongue because it is the nativetongue--the easy, familiar, natural vehicle of expression; of the nativedress because it is almost always comfortable and comely; of the nativecustoms, whenever they are not unhealthy or demoralising, because theyare the distinctive heritage of a people; and again, of tongue, dress,and customs alike, if you will, simply because they are dissimilar.[Sidenote: A BARREN UNIFORMITY]For it has always seemed a trumpery notion that uniformity in thesethings has any connection with the upbuilding of a people, has anyethical relation at all, and I have always wondered that so trumpery anotion should have so wide an influence. Moreover, is it not a littlecurious that, whereas the trend of biological evolution on its upwardcourse, as Spencer assures us, is towards differentiation anddissimilarity, the trend of sociological evolution should be so markedtowards this bald and barren uniformity? But these be deep matters.I have never been able to join in the reproach of superciliousness sooften applied to the lines of that noblest of missionary hymns in whichBishop Heber asks, "Can we, whose souls are lighted with wisdom from onhigh, Can we, to men benighted, the lamp of life deny?" If that besuperciliousness, it is an essential superciliousness of Christianityitself, for the question lies at the very core of our religion and willnot cease to be asked so long as the world contains those who believewith all their hearts, and those who do not believe because they havenot heard. I never listen to that hymn without emotion, it can still"shake me like a cry Of trumpets going by." But the question that seemsto stir the souls of some missionaries and most school-teachers, "Can wedeny to these unfortunate heathen our millinery, our 'Old Oaken Bucket,'our Mr. and our Mrs.," leaves me quite cold.Here was the weekly afternoon routine at this mission, only the morningsbeing devoted to books and classes: On Monday the children brought theirsoiled clothes of the week to the schoolroom and washed them; on Tuesdaythey were dried and ironed; on Wednesday they were mended; on Thursday ajuvenile "society" did some sort of work for another mission; on Fridayevery child in the village had a hot bath. Now, let a routine of thatsort be kept up, week after week, month after month, year after year,during the whole school life of a child, and it is bound to leave itsmark; and there is no other way in which the same mark may be made.At the Allakaket is fine example of what, I think, is the best rule inthe world for the inferior races--the absolute rule of a devoted,intelligent, capable gentlewoman. We are but now writing the indenturesof their apprenticeship to self-government in the elective villagecouncils we have set up; it is good for them to serve it under thisloving and unquestioned despotism.[Sidenote: MATTERS METEOROLOGICAL]During all that Christmas season the temperature was subject to suchviolent fluctuations that a chart of them would look like the pictureshowing the comparative heights of mountains, that used to be presentedunder "The World in Hemispheres" in the school geographies. A minimum of52° below zero and a maximum of 10° below, was followed by a minimum of53° below and a maximum of 18° below, and that by a minimum of 56° belowand a maximum of 14° below, while on Christmas Day itself we registereda minimum of 58° below zero and a maximum of 1° above, a range of 59° inless than twelve hours. At a time of the year when the sun has scarcelyany effect upon the temperature such tremendous changes point tocorresponding atmospheric disturbances, and each rise was caused by theirruption of clouds upon a clear sky and was followed by a fall of snow.It is a beautifully simple process. Driven into these regions by somecompelling current of the upper atmosphere comes a mass of warm airladen with moisture--a cloud. As it comes in contact with the cold airof the region it parts with its heat, and the temperature of the lowerair rises. Having parted with its heat, it can no longer contain itsmoisture; and, having parted with its moisture, it ceases to exist. Thecold of the earth and of its immediate air envelope has seized upon thatcloud and devoured it, and the cold resumes its sway. So have I openedthe door of a crowded cabin, when an Indian dance or other gathering wasin progress, at 50° or 60° below zero, and the cold, dry air meeting thehot, moist air has caused an immediate fall of snow on the threshold.After the abrupt rise in temperature on Christmas Day, the snow began tofall heavily, with a barometer continually falling until it reached27.98 inches, the lowest point recorded here (at an elevation of about500 feet above the sea) in two years and a half--and before the snowceased three feet had fallen.Our winter itinerary called us to leave the Allakaket immediately afterNew Year's Day, and our route lay overland through a totally uninhabitedcountry for nearly one hundred and fifty miles, to Tanana on the Yukon.We knew that it would not greatly interfere with our plans to lieanother week at the Allakaket, and that would bring our departure afterthe monthly journey of the mail-carrier and would thus compel him tobreak trail for us through all that snow. That is the way themail-carriers in Alaska are usually treated, but Arthur and I took somepride in keeping as closely as possible to the announced dates ofvisitation and in doing such share of trail breaking as fell to us.[Sidenote: TRAIL BREAKING]So on Monday, the 3d of January, 1910, we bade farewell to DeaconessCarter and her colleague and to the native charges they rule and carefor so admirably, and set out on our journey with an additional boy fromthe mission to help us through the heavy snow of the Koyukuk valley. Forten or twelve miles the way lay down the river, and the going was slowand toilsome from the first, although there had been some passage fromMoses' Village to the mission, and there was, therefore, some trail. Ourstart had been late--it is next to impossible to get an early start froma mission; there is always some native who must have audience at thelast moment--and after the long repose we were so soft that the heavytrail had wearied us, and we decided to "call it a day" when in five anda half hours we came to the road-house, the last occupied habitationbetween the Allakaket and Tanana. Soon after we reached the villagethere came trooping down from the mission a number of the inhabitantsgone up for Christmas, who, after weeping upon our necks, so to speak,at our departure, had left us to break out that drifted trail for theirconvenient return. So will Indians treat a white man almost always, butI had thought myself an exception and was vexed to find that so they hadtreated me.The next morning we entered the uninhabited wilderness with three feetof new snow on the trail and no passage over it since it had fallen. Ourfirst trouble was finding the trail at all. The previous fall the AlaskaRoad Commission had appropriated a sum of money to stake this trail fromTanana to the Koyukuk River, for it passes over wind-swept, treelesswastes, where many men had lost their way. Starting out from Tanana, themen employed had done their work well until within ten miles of theKoyukuk River. There it was found that the labour and cost alreadyexpended had exhausted the appropriation, whereupon the proceedings wereimmediately stopped; not another stake was driven, and the whole partyreturned to Tanana and mushed two hundred and fifty miles up the Yukonto spend another little appropriation upon another trail. That is theunbusinesslike system in which the money available for such work inAlaska has been handled.The first trail breaker goes ahead with a long stick, which he thrustscontinually down through the snow. The slightly harder surface overwhich sleds and dogs have passed reveals itself by offering moreresistance to the penetration of the stick, and that is the only way thetrail can be found. Even with three feet of new snow upon it, it is wellworth while finding, or otherwise there is no bottom at all and way mustbe made through all the snow of the winter. But all Alaskan trails areserpentine, and it is very difficult to put the new trail right on topof the old one. Back and forth the second trail breaker goes between hisleader and the sled, and at intervals the first man comes back and forthalso. And with it all is no path packed solid enough for the dogs todraw the heavy sled without great difficulty. We should have had atoboggan, but toboggans are little used on the Koyukuk, and we had onlyour sled. In five hours we made five miles and were worn out. We decidedto pitch our tent and go ahead and break trail for the morrow'sjourney. On the lakes interspersed amongst the brush we had to break anentirely new trail, for we could find no trace of the old one.If five miles in five hours be poor going, what is four miles in sevenand a half hours? That is all we made the next day despite thesnow-shoeing of the previous evening. The heavy sled was continuallygetting off the trail, however wide we show-shoed it. The two of usahead went over every step of the distance four or five times, andsometimes all of us had to go back and forth again and again before thesled could be brought along at all. It was from 5° to 10° above zero allday, and at intervals snow fell heavily. We got at last to the middle ofa little lake and were confronted by open water, the result of some warmspring, one supposes. Here we must stop until a laborious journey wasmade to the bank, trees were cut and carried, and the open place bridgedso that the sled might be passed over it. Then again our painfulprogress was resumed until, as it grew dark, we reached the bank of theKornutna, or Old Man Creek, and here we pitched tent again, and I wentforward upon the bed of the stream to break out a part of to-morrow'spath. That night two more inches of snow fell.[Sidenote: DOG DRIVING]For four miles the trail lies along the surface of this creek, and thentakes up a steep gully and over a divide. That four miles was all wemade the next day, back and forth, back and forth, wearily tramping itto and fro, dogs and men alike exhausted with the toil. The hatefulnessof dog mushing usually appears under such circumstances; the whip isconstantly plied, the senseless objurgations rise shriller and fuller.Once the sled is started, it must by any means be kept going, that asgreat a distance as possible may be covered before it stops again. Thepoor brutes, sinking almost to their bellies despite the snow-shoeing,have no purchase for the exercise of their strength and continuallyflounder and wallow. Our whip was lost and I was glad of it, for even asconsiderate a boy as Arthur is apt to lose patience and temper when,having started the sled with much labour by gee pole and rope about hischest, it goes but a few feet and comes to a halt again, or slips fromthe track and turns over in the deep snow. But it is at such times, too,that one appreciates at his full value such a noble puller as our wheeldog Nanook. He spares himself not at all; the one absorbing occupationof every nerve and muscle of his body is pulling. His trace is alwaystaut, or, if he lose footing for a moment and the trace slacken, he isup and at it again that the sled lose not its momentum if he can helpit. When the lead line is pulled back that the sled may be started bythe jerk of the dogs' sudden traction, Nanook lunges forward at thecommand, "Mush!" and strains at the collar, mouth open and panting,tongue dropping moisture, as keen and eager to keep that sled moving asis the driver himself. All day he labours and struggles, snatching amouthful of snow now and then to cool his overheated body, and he dropsin his tracks when the final halt is made, utterly weary, yet alwayswith the brave heart in him to give his bark, his five-notecharacteristic bark of gladness, that the day's work is done at last.It is senseless brutality to whip such a dog, and most of our dogs wereof that mettle, though Nanook was the strongest and most faithful of thebunch. One's heart goes out to them with gratitude and love--old"Lingo," "Nig," "Snowball," "Wolf," and "Doc"--as one realises whatloyal, cheerful service they give.[Sidenote: VIOLENT FLUCTUATIONS]Arthur was so unwell with a violent cold and cough, that had beengrowing worse for a couple of days, that I decided on two things: toleave him in the tent while I snow-shoed ahead the next day, and to sendback the boy I had brought from the mission to secure a fresh supply offood; for the back trail was, of course, comparatively easy. Arthur'scondition threatened pneumonia, to my notion, and I believe he was savedfrom an attack of that disease which is so often fatal in this countryby long rubbing all over the neck and the chest with a remedy that wasnew then--a menthol balm. I have used it again and again since and I amnow never without it. A second application made in the morning, Istarted out, show-shoeing up the long hill and then down into the flat,and so to the mail-carrier's little hut that is reached under goodconditions of trail the first day from Moses' Village, and then backagain to the tent. That day a tendon in my right leg behind the kneebecame increasingly troublesome, and in climbing the hill on the returnwas acutely painful. I recognised it as "mal-de-raquet," well known inthe Northwest, where the snow is commonly much deeper than in Alaska,and I found relief in the application of the same analgesic menthol balmthat I was rejoiced to find had wrought a great improvement in Arthur'scondition.Meanwhile the warm weather of the past three or four days was over andanother period of violent fluctuations of temperature similar to thataround Christmastide was upon us. We went to bed with the thermometer at10° below zero and were wakened by the cold at two in the morning tofind it at 40° below, so we had to keep a fire going the rest of thenight; for as soon as the fire in the stove goes out a tent becomes justas cold as outdoors.We moved forward the next morning, but the trail we had broken was toonarrow and had to be widened, which meant one snow-shoe in the deep snowall the time, a very fatiguing process that brought into painful playagain the tendon strained with five days' heavy snow-shoeing.The temperature was around 40° below all day, and our progress was soslow that it was not easy to keep warm, and the dogs whined at theinnumerable stops. Yesterday it had been 10° below, the day before 10°above, and now, to-day, 40° below. It is hard to dress for suchchangeable weather, especially hard to dress the feet. My own wear, allthe winter through, is a pair of smoke-tanned, moose-hide breeches,tanned on the Yukon but tailored outside. They are a perfect windbreak,yet allow ventilation, and they are very warm; but those who perspiremuch on exertion cannot wear them. The amount of covering upon the feetmust be varied, in some measure at least, as the temperature changes.The Esquimau fur boot, with fur on the inside of the sole and on theoutside of the upper, is my favourite footwear, with more or less ofsock inside it as the weather requires; but such sudden changes as wewere experiencing always find one or leave one with too much or toolittle footwear. By one-thirty we had struggled to the top of the hill,and it was very evident that the cabin was out of the question that day;so, since to pass down into the flat was to pass out of eligible campingtimber, we pitched tent on the brow of the hill.The cold business of making camp was done, all dispositions for thenight complete, supper for men and dogs was cooked and ours eating, whenwe heard a noise in the distance that set our dogs barking and presentlycame the boy I had sent back, accompanied by an Indian and a fresh teamloaded with such a bountiful supply of food, much of it cooked, that onefelt it was worth while to get into distress to receive such generousand prompt succour. The ladies at the mission had sat up and cooked allnight and had despatched the fastest team in the village the nextmorning to bring their provisions to us and to help us along. They hadthought us at Tanana when we were not yet at the end of the first day'sstage from Moses' Village. It would have been impossible for us to reachTanana on the dog food and man food we started with.[Sidenote: SIXTY-FIVE BELOW ZERO]It was so cold and we were so crowded that I arose at three and made afire and sat over it the rest of the night, and after breakfast,although it was Sunday, morning prayer being said, I started ahead againto break out the trail deeper and wider, leaving the teams with thedistributed loads to follow. The thermometer stood at 38° below zerowhen I left camp, but as I began the descent it was evident that it grewcolder, and at the bottom of the hill I was sure it was 20° colder atleast. Reaching the cabin, I kindled a fire and started back to meet theteams. About a mile from the cabin I saw them, for, since the load wasdistributed in the two sleds progress was much better; but by this timeit had grown so cold that the dogs were almost entirely obscured fromview by the clouds of steam that encompassed them. We hurried as best wemight and reached the cabin about eleven, and as soon as we were arrivedI took out the thermometer and let it lie long enough to get thetemperature of the air, and it read 65° below zero. There had been noatmospheric change at all; it was simply the most marked instance I everknew of the influence of altitude upon temperature. We had descendedperhaps three hundred feet, and in that distance had found a differenceof 27° in temperature.The cabin was a wretched shack without door or window and full of holes,and in no part of it could one stand upright. We set ourselves to makethings as comfortable as possible, however, rigging up the canvas sledcover for an outer door and a blanket for an inner door, and stopping upthe worst of the holes with sacking. Then we went out and cut freshspruce boughs to lie upon, and prospected around quite a while before wefound dry wood nearly a quarter of a mile away. It was quite a businesscutting that wood and packing the heavy sticks on one's shoulders,through the brush and up and down the banks of the little creek whereit grew, on snow-shoes, at 65° below zero.Our Sabbath day's journey done, the hut safely reached and furnishedwith fuel, we did not linger long after supper, but, evening prayersaid, went to bed as the most comfortable place in the still cold cabin,thankful not to be in a tent in such severe weather.The next day gave us fresh temperature fluctuations. At nine A. M. itclouded and rose to 35° below, by noon it had cleared again and thethermometer fell to 55° below, and at nine P. M. it stood once more at65° below. The milder weather of the morning sent all hands out breakingtrail, save myself, for with all our stuff in a cabin without a door itwas not wise to leave it altogether--a dog might break a chain and workhavoc--so I stayed behind in the little dark hovel, a candle burning allday, and read some fifty pages of Boswell's _Life of Samuel Johnson_over again. Some such little India-paper classic it is my habit to carryeach winter. Last year I reread Pepys's _Diary_ and the year before muchof the _Decline and Fall_. Certain places are for ever associated in mymind with the rereading of certain old books. The Chandalar River is tome as much the scene of _Lorna Doone_, which I read for the sixth orseventh time on my first journey along it, as Exmoor itself; and _TheCloister and the Hearth_, that noble historical romance, belongs in myliterary geography to the Alatna-Kobuk portage. So will Boswell alwaysbring back to me this trip across country from the Koyukuk to the Yukonthrough the deep snow.The boys came back after dark, having broken some nine miles of trailand having suffered a good deal from the cold. I had supper cooked, andwhen that was done and the dogs fed we fell to reading the Gospels andEpistles for the Epiphany season, the boys reading aloud by turns. Theall-day fire had warmed the little hut thoroughly, and despite the coldoutside we were snug and comfortable within.[Sidenote: SEVENTY BELOW ZERO]That night the thermometer touched 70° below zero, within 2° of thegreatest cold I have recorded in seven years' winter travel; a greatercold, I believe, than any arctic expedition has ever recorded, for it isin a continental climate like Siberia or interior Alaska, and not in themarine climate around the North Pole, that the thermometer falls lowest.Save for an hour or two getting wood, we all lay close next day, for thetemperature at noon was no higher than 64° below. It is impossible tobreak trail at such temperature, or to travel as slowly as we weretravelling. In the strong cold one must travel fast if one travel atall. Indeed, it is distinctly dangerous to be outdoors. As soon as oneleaves the hut the cold smites one in the face like a mailed fist. Theexpiration of the breath makes a crackling sound, due, one judges, tothe sudden congealing of the moisture that is expelled. From everycranny of the cabin a stream of smoke-like vapour pours into the air,giving the appearance that the house is on fire within. However warmlyhands and feet may be clad, one cannot stand still for a minute withoutfeeling the heat steadily oozing out and the cold creeping in.Notwithstanding the weather, that evening the mail came along, thewhite man who is the carrier, two tall, strong natives, and nine dogs.Only since descending to the flat had they suffered from the cold, forthey found as great a difference as we did in the temperature; and theywere grateful to us for the trail we had broken. The hut wasuncomfortably crowded that night with seven people in it, but thethermometer stood at -56° and was rising, and gave us hope that we mightmove along to-morrow. Augmented as our party was into seven men, threesleds, and nineteen or twenty dogs, trail breaking would not be soarduous and progress would be much accelerated. There was good hope,moreover, that the heavy snow was confined to the Koyukuk valley andthat when we passed out of it we should find better going.The morning found a temperature of 45° below, and we sallied forth,quite an expedition. Four, including myself, went ahead beating down thetrail; one was at each gee pole, our team last, getting advantage ofeverything preceding. So far as the trail had been broken we made goodtime, covering the nine miles in about four hours. Another hour ofsomewhat slower progress took us to the top of a hill, and here themail-carrier's two Indians had run ahead and built a great, roaring fireand arranged a wide, commodious couch of spruce boughs, and we cookedour lunch and took our ease for half an hour. The sky had clouded againand the temperature had risen to 28° below.[Sidenote: CLOSE QUARTERS]It is strange how some scenes of the trail linger in the memory, whileothers are completely forgotten. This noon halt I always remember asone of the pleasantest of all my journeyings. There was not a breath ofwind, and the smoke rose straight into the air instead of volleying andeddying into one's face as camp-fires so often do on whichever side ofthem one sits. We were all weary with our five hours' trudge, and therest was grateful; hungry, and the boiled ham they had sent from themission was delicious. The warmth of the great fire and the cosiness ofthe thick, deep spruce boughs gave solid comfort, and the pipe after themeal was a luxurious enjoyment.From that on the going was heavier and our progress slower, but we keptat it till dark, and still far into the night, fortunate in having twoIndians who knew every step of the way, until at last we reached the hutthat marks the end of the second stage from the Koyukuk River, on thetop of a birch hill. We had made nineteen and a half miles that day andhad taken eleven hours to do it.If the noon rest be remembered as one of the pleasantest episodes of thetrail, that night in the cabin on the hill I recall as one of the mostmiserable in my life. The hut was still smaller than the previous one,like it without door and window, and so low that one was bent double allthe time. Walls and roof alike were covered with a thick coating offrost. The only wood discoverable in the dark was half-dry birch whichwould not burn in the stove but sent out volumes of smoke that blindedus. When the hut did begin to get a little warm, moisture from the roofdropped on everything. There we seven men huddled together, chilly anddamp, choked and weary--a wretched band. There was no room for thenecessary cooking operations; we had to cook and eat in relays; and howwe slept, in what way seven men managed to pack themselves and stretchthemselves in those narrow quarters, I cannot tell. However, we said ourprayers and went to bed, snow falling heavily. The Indians were soonsnoring, but sleep would not come to me, tired as I was, and I had notslept at all the previous night. So presently I took trional, X grs.,and dozed off till morning.Then we resolved to divide forces rather than subject ourselves to themiserable inconvenience of overcrowding these tiny huts, and at thisstage of the journey it was possible to do so without losing a wholeday, for there was a cabin for the noon rest. It was arranged that themail-man should start first and make the full day's run if possible,while we should "call it a day" at the half-way hut.So Bob and his Indians sallied forth while yet my boys were readingtheir lessons to me, and when they were done we hitched up and followed.And as soon as we were down the hill and started along the bald flat, itwas evident that we were out of the deep snowfall, for the present atany rate, and we plucked up spirit, for we were now to cross the wide,open, wind-swept uplands of the headwaters of the Melozitna and Tozitna,tributaries of the Yukon--the "Tozi" and "Melozi," as the white men callthem--where snow never lies deep or long. We were out of the Koyukukwatershed now and in country drained by direct tributaries of theYukon. The going was now incomparably the best we had had since we leftthe mission, the snow was light and we had the mail-carrier's trail;but, although the temperature had risen to 21° below, a keen wind putour parkee hoods up and our scarfs around our faces and made our 60°below clothing none too warm. In three hours we had reached the Melozicabin, although that had included the climbing of a long, steep hill,and here we stayed for the rest of the day and night and shot someptarmigan for supper, though we could easily have gone on and made therest of the run.The next day I sent the auxiliary sled and team and driver back to theAllakaket, keeping the mission boy with me, however, to return with themail-carrier, who was already late and must go back as soon as hereached Tanana. I parted with the Indian regretfully, for he had beenmost helpful and always good-natured and cheerful, and had really begunto learn a little at our travelling night-school.[Sidenote: THE STAKED TRAIL][Sidenote: THE ARCTIC SKIES]A high wind was blowing, with the thermometer at 12° below, and themail-man's trail was already drifted over and quite indistinguishable inthe dark, and we began to appreciate the recent staking of this trail bythe Road Commission. But for these stakes, set double, a hundred yardsapart, so that they formed a lane, it would have been difficult if notimpossible for us to travel on a day like this, for here was a stretchof sixteen or seventeen miles with never a tree and hardly the smallestbush. The wind blew stronger and stronger directly in our faces as werose out of the Melozitna basin on the hill that is its watershed, andwhen the summit was reached and we turned and looked back there wasnothing visible but a white, wind-swept waste. But ahead all the snowwas most beautifully and delicately tinted from the reflection of thedawn on ragged shredded clouds that streamed across the southeasternsky. Where the sky was free of cloud it gave a wonderful clear greenthat was almost but not quite the colour of malachite. It was exactlythe colour of the water the propeller of a steamship churns up where theAtlantic Ocean shallows to the rocky shore of the north coast ofIreland. The clouds themselves caught a deep dull red from the sunrise,which the snow gave back in blush pink. Such an exquisite colour harmonydid the scene compose that the wind, lulling for a moment on the crestof the hill, seemed charmed into peace by it.The feast of colour brought a train of colour memories, one hard uponthe heels of another, as we went down the hill; the Catbells, thisgolden with bracken, that purple with heather, and each doubled in thedepths of Derwentwater; an October morning in the hardwood forests ofthe mountains of Tennessee, when for half an hour every gorgeous tint ofred and yellow was lavishly flaunted--and then the whole pride andsplendour of it wiped out at once by a wind that sprang up; theencircling and towering reds and pinks of a gigantic amphitheatre ofrock in the Dolomites; a patch of flowers right against the snow in thehigh Rockies, so intensely blue that it seemed the whole vault of heavencould be tinctured with the pigment that one petal would distil. And,more inspiring than them all, there came the recollection of thatwonderful sunrise and those blazing mountains of the Alatna-Kobukportage. Every land has its glories, and the sky is everywhere a blankcanvas for the display of splendid colour, but the tints of the arcticsky are of an infinite purity of individual tone that no other sky canshow.As we descended the hill into the Tozitna basin the wind rose again, nowcharged with heavy, driving snow, while in the valley the underfoot snowgrew deep, so that it was drawing to dusk when we reached the cabin on afork of the Tozitna where Bob the mail-man had spent the previous night,and there we stayed.The next day is worthy of record for the sharp contrast it affords. Allthe night it had snowed heavily, and it snowed all the morning and intothe afternoon. Some sixteen or seventeen inches of snow had fallen sinceBob and his party passed, and again we had no trail at all.Moreover--strange plaint in January in Alaska!--the weather grew so warmthat the snow continually balled up under the snow-shoes and clung tothe sled and the dogs. At noon the thermometer stood at 17° abovezero--and it was but four days ago that we recorded 70° below! It willbe readily understood how such wide and sudden ranges of temperature addto the inconvenience and discomfort of mushing. Parkees, sweaters,shirts are shed one after the other, the fur cap becomes a nuisance, themittens a burden, and still ploughing through the snow he is bathed insweat who had forgotten what sweating felt like. The poor dogs sufferthe most, for they have nothing they can shed and they can perspire onlythrough the mouth. Their tongues drop water almost in a stream, theylabour for their breath, and their eyes have a look that comes only withsoft weather and a heavy trail. So constantly do they grab mouthfuls ofsnow that the operation becomes quite a check on our progress.By two o'clock it was growing dusk, and we had but reached the bank ofthe other fork of the Tozitna, not more than eight or nine miles fromthe cabin where we spent the night and yet thirteen or fourteen milesfrom the cabin we had hoped to reach. Beyond the banks of the stream wasno more timber for a long distance; was such another stretch of opencountry as we had passed the previous day. So here was anotherdisappointment, for camp must be made now lest there be no chance tomake camp at all. But it was a good and comfortable camp, amidst thelarge spruce of the watercourse. Such disappointments are part of lifeon the trail; and supper done there was the more time for the boys.The open country was again wind-swept, and being wind-swept the snow wassomewhat hardened, and we fought our way against a gale, covering thetwelve and three quarter miles in ten hours, Sunday though it was. Atthat last stage on the road to Tanana came out a young man from themission with a dog team and an Indian, anxious at our long delay, andHarry Strangman's name is written here with grateful recognition of thiskindness and many others. We went joyfully into town on the morrow, the17th of January, having taken fifteen days to make a journey that isnormally made in five.[Sidenote: THE MAIL-CARRIER]Half-way on that last day's mush we met the mail-man returning to theKoyukuk. So much had he been delayed that there was danger of a fine andall sorts of trouble, and the mail had been sent out to meet him at thenoon cabin, together with a supply of grub for the return trip. But thecaterer, whoever he was, forgot candles, and the mail-man would have hadto make his way back to the Koyukuk without any means of artificiallight, in the shortest days of the year, had we not been able to supplyhim with half a dozen candles that remained to us. It was adisappointment to George, the boy I had brought from the mission, thathe must turn round and go back also. He had never "seen Tanana," whichis quite a metropolis to him, and had looked forward to it keenly allthe journey, but the boy braced up and took his disappointment manfully.A pitiful procession it was that passed us by and took our boy away; thepoor, wearied dogs that had certainly earned the few days' rest theywere so badly in need of left a trail of blood behind them that wassickening to see. Almost every one of them had sore, frozen feet; manyof them were lame; and when we came to descend the long hill they hadjust climbed, right at its brow, where the stiffest pull had been, was aclaw from a dog's foot frozen into bloody snow.So far as there is anything heroic about the Alaskan trail, themail-carriers are the real heroes. They must start out in all weathers,at all temperatures; they have a certain specified time in which to maketheir trips and they must keep within that time or there is trouble. Thebordering country of the Canadian Yukon has a more humane governmentthan ours. There neither mail-carrier nor any one else, save in somelife-or-death emergency, with licence from the Northwest Mounted Police,may take out horse or dogs to start a journey when the temperature islower than 45° below zero; but I have seen a reluctant mail-carrierchased out at 60° below zero, on pain of losing his job, on the Americanside. Moreover, between the seasons, when travel on the rivers ispositively dangerous to life, the mail must still be despatched andreceived, although so great is the known risk to the mail, as well as tothe carrier, that no one will send any letter that he cares at all aboutreaching its destination until the trails are established or thesteamboats run. But the virtually empty pouches must be transported fromoffice to office through the running, or over the rotting ice, just thesame, on pain of the high displeasure and penalty of a departmentwithout brains and without bowels. I have often wished since I came toAlaska that I could be postmaster-general for one week, and so I supposehas almost every other resident of the country.The week following my arrival at Tanana was a solid week of coldweather, the thermometer ranging around 50° and 60° below zero, and thatmeans keeping pretty close to the house. Even the sentries at the armypost are withdrawn and the protection of the garrison is confided to aman who watches the grounds from a glass-walled cupola above theheadquarters building. Yet a week of confinement and inaction growstiresome after life in the open.Sunday is always a busy day here. The mission and native village arethree miles away from the town, and service must be held at both. Themission at Tanana is not a happy place to visit for one who has thewelfare of the natives at heart. Despite faithful and devoted effort tocheck it, the demoralisation goes on apace and the outlook is dark.[Sidenote: SINGLE MEN IN BARRACKS]"Single men in barracks don't grow into plaster saints," we are told;sometimes they seem to grow into drunken, lustful devils withoutcompassion for childhood, not to mention any feeling of magnanimitytowards a feebler race. And when a girl who has been rough-handled, orwho has been given drink until she is unable to resist the multipleoutrage practised upon her, is told to pick out the malefactors from acompany of soldiers, all clean-shaven, all dressed alike, all around thesame age, she generally fails to identify altogether. So the offencegoes unwhipped, and the officer is likely as not to address a reprimandto the complaining missionary for "preferring charges you are unable tosubstantiate." Yet an officer who had himself written such a letter toldme once that all Indians looked alike to him. Even should the girlidentify one or more men, they have usually half a dozen comrades readyto swear an alibi.Add to the trouble given by the soldiers the constant operation of theslinking bootleggers of the town, a score or more of whom are known tomake money by this liquor peddling, and some of whom do nothing else fora living, yet whom it is next to impossible to convict, owing to thecumbrous machinery of the law and the attitude of juries, and it will beseen that the hands of those who are fighting for the native race aretied.What has been said about the military does not by any means apply toall, either officers or men. Some of the officers have been decent,God-fearing men, conscious of the evil and zealous to suppress it; someof the men, indeed in all probability most of the men, quite free fromsuch offence; some commanding officers have kept such a well-disciplinedpost that offences of all kinds have been greatly reduced. But thecommanding officer is changed every year, and the whole force is changedevery two years, so that there is no continuity of policy at the post,and an administration that has grown familiar with conditions and thatstands so far as it can for clean living and sobriety and decency andthe protection of the native people, may be followed by one that isloftily ignorant of the situation, careless about offences againstmorality, and impatient of any complaint.Off by himself, separate from the demoralising influence of the low-downwhite, there is every hope and encouragement in the effort to elevateand educate the Indian; set down cheek by jowl with the riffraff oftowns and barracks, his fate seems sealed.[Sidenote: DEATH-RATE AND BIRTH-RATE]Let these two mission stations, the Allakaket and Tanana, one hundredand fifty miles or so apart by the winter trail, represent the twoconditions. In six years' time there has been manifest advance at theone and decay at the other. The birth-rate is greatly in excess of thedeath-rate at the Allakaket, the death-rate greatly in excess of thebirth-rate at Tanana. In the year in which this journey was made therewere thirty-four deaths and fourteen births at Tanana, and while thedifference was an unusually large one, yet in the six years referred tothere has not been one year in which the number of births exceeded thenumber of deaths. One does not have to be a prophet to foresee theinevitable result, if the process be not stopped.A tribute should be paid to the zeal, now of one, now of another armysurgeon at Fort Gibbon in tending the native sick, three miles away,when we have been unable to procure a physician of our own for theplace. The missionary nurse, for five years last past Miss FlorenceLangdon, has been greatly helped in her almost desperate efforts here bythe willing co-operation of these medical officers of the army.FOOTNOTE:[B] See illustration, p. 374.CHAPTER VIIIUP THE YUKON TO RAMPART AND ACROSS COUNTRY TO THE TANANA--ALASKANAGRICULTURE--THE GOOD DOG NANOOK--MISS FARTHING'S BOYS AT NENANA--CHENAAND FAIRBANKSOUR course from Tanana did not lie directly up the Tanana River, but upthe Yukon to Rampart and then across country to the Hot Springs on theTanana River. The seventy-five miles up the Yukon was through the LowerRamparts, one of the most picturesque portions of this great river. Thestream is confined in one deep channel by lofty mountains on both banks,and the scenery at times is very bold and wild. But its topography makesit the natural wind course of the country--a down-river wind in winter,an up-river wind in summer blows almost continually. It was no colderthan 5° below zero when we started on the trip, but the wind made thetravelling unpleasant. The second day it had increased to a gale, andevery mile we travelled it grew stronger. We travelled three hours, andthe last hour we made scarcely a mile. So thickly charged with flyingsnow was the wind and so dead ahead that despite parkee hoods it blindedus, and the dogs could hardly be forced to keep their heads towards it.Their faces were so coated with crusted snow that they looked curiouslylike the face of harlequin in the pantomime. It did become literallyintolerable, and when Arthur said that he knew there was a cabin rightacross the river, we made our way thither and shortly found it and laythere the rest of the day, the gale blowing incessantly. This wasdisappointing, because it meant that I could not reach Rampart for theSunday I had appointed.Next day the wind had ceased and the thermometer went down to 30° belowzero. In places the ice was blown clear of snow; in other places it washeavily drifted. By midday we had reached the lonely telegraph stationat "The Rapids," and were very kindly received by the signal-corps menin charge. They gave us to eat and to drink and would take no money.There is little travel on this part of the river nowadays, and thetelegraph men are glad to see any one who may chance to pass by. Wepushed on heavily again, and had to stop and cut a gee pole presently,for it was hard to handle the sled without it; but the gee pole alwaysmeans laborious travel. The cold was welcome; it meant no wind; and wewere glad to see the thermometer drop lower than 50° below zero thatnight at the old mail cabin. The mail goes no longer on the Yukon Riverfrom Fort Yukon to Tanana, and, barring this point, Rampart, towardswhich we were travelling, which is supplied across country from the HotSprings, over the route we should traverse, no spot on that threehundred and fifty miles of river receives any mail at all. Thepopulation is small and scattered, it is true; on the same groundsAlaska might be denied any mail at all. There has been much resentmentat this abandonment of the Yukon River by the post-office and severalpetitions for its restoration, but it has not been restored.[Sidenote: THE WIND-SWEPT YUKON]We travelled all the next day at 50° below zero, and it was one of thepleasantest days of the winter. There was not a breath of wind, thegoing steadily improved, and, best of all, for three hours we weretravelling in the sunshine for the first time this winter. Only thosewho have been deprived of the sun can really understand how joyful andgrateful his return is. There was no heat in his rays, this last day ofJanuary; the thermometer stood at 49° below at noon, and had risen but5° since our start in the morning; but the mere sight of him glowing inthe south, where a great bend of the river gave him to us through a gapin the mountains, was cheerful and invigorating after two months inwhich we had seen no more than his gilding of the high snows. The sungives life to the dead landscape, colour to the oppressive monotony ofwhite and black, and man's heart leaps to the change as jubilantly asdoes the face of nature.[Sidenote: RAMPART AND ITS SALOON]Rampart City differs from Circle City, the other decayed mining town ofthe Yukon River, only in that the process is further advanced. Year byyear there are a few less men on the creeks behind it, a few lessresidents in the town itself. Its long, straggling water-front consistsin the main of empty buildings, the windows boarded up, the snow driftedhigh about the doors. One store now serves all ends of trade, one liquorshop serves all the desire for drink of the whites, and slops overthrough the agency of two or three dissolute squaw men and half-breedsto the natives up and down the river.[C]Rampart had one fat year, 1898, when many hundreds of gold seekers,approaching the Klondike by Saint Michael and the lower Yukon wereattracted and halted by the gold discoveries on Big and Little Minook,and spent the winter here. The next spring news was brought of the richdiscoveries on Anvil Creek, behind Cape Nome, and an exodus began whichgrew into a veritable stampede in 1900, when the gold discoveries in thebeach itself were made. Rampart's large population faded away as surelyand as quickly to Nome as Circle City's population did to the Klondike.The Indians are almost all gone from their village a mile above thetown; they dwindled away with the dwindling prosperity, some to Tanana,some to other points down the river; and what used to be the worst smallnative community in the interior of Alaska has almost ceased to exist.Most of the little band of white folks still remaining were gatheredtogether at night, and appreciated, I thought, their semiannualopportunity for Divine service.[Sidenote: "DEVELOPED"]There is no resisting the melancholy that hangs over a place like this.As one treads the crazy, treacherous board sidewalks, full of holes androtten planks, now rising a step or two, now falling, and reads thedimmed and dirty signs that once flaunted their gold and colours,"Golden North," "Pioneer," "Reception," "The Senate" (why should everytown in Alaska have a "Senate" saloon and not one a "House ofRepresentatives"?), one conjures up the scenes of rude revelry thesedrinking places witnessed a few years ago. How high the hopes of suddenriches burned in the breasts of the men who went in and out of them,doomed to utter disappointment in the vast majority! What a rapscallioncrew, male and female, followed this great mob of gold seekers, and grewricher as their victims grew poorer! What earned and borrowed and savedand begged and stolen moneys were frittered away and flung away thatwinter; what health and character were undermined! How the ribaldry andvaliant, stupid blasphemy rang out in these tumbling-down shanties! Goout on the creeks and see the hills denuded of their timber, thestream-beds punched with innumerable holes, filled up or filling up, thecabins and sluice-boxes rotting into the moss, here and there a brokenpick and shovel, here and there a rusting boiler, and take notice thatthis region has been "developed."When the debit and credit sides of the ledger are balanced, what remainsto Alaska of all these thousands of men, of all the many hundreds ofthousands of dollars they brought with them? Those creeks, stripped,gutted, and deserted; this town, waiting for a kindly fire with afavouring breeze to wipe out its useless emptiness; a few half-breedchildren at mission schools; a hardy native tribe, sophisticated,diseased, demoralised, and largely dead--that seems the net result.The portage trail from Rampart to the Tanana River goes up Minook Creekand follows the valley to its head, then crosses a summit and passesdown through several small mining settlements to the Hot Springs. Thetrail saves traversing two sides of the triangle which it makes with thetwo rivers.The dogs' feet and legs had suffered so much from the deep snow and theheavy labour of the journey out of the Koyukuk and the rough ice of theYukon that I was compelled to have not merely moccasins but moose-hideleggings made here, coming right up to the belly and tying over theback. All the hair was worn away from the back of the legs and the skinwas in many places raw.We had thought to cover the twenty-five or thirty miles up the valleyand over the summit to a road-house just beyond its foot, but roughdrifted trails and a high wind held us back until it was dark before theascent was reached, and we pitched our tent and reserved the climb forthe morrow.It was a hard grind owing to the drifted snow and the wind that stilldisputed our passage, but the view from the summit, nearly eighteenhundred feet above last night's camp, was compensation enough, for itgave us the great mountain, Denali, or, as the map makers and somewhite men call it, Mount McKinley. Perhaps an hundred and fifty milesaway, as the crow flies, it rose up and filled all the angle of visionto the southwest. It is not a peak, it is a region, a great soaring ofthe earth's crust, rising twenty thousand feet high; so enormous in itsmass, in its snow-fields and glaciers, its buttresses, its flankingspurs, its far-flung terraces of foot-hills and approaches, that itcompletely dominates the view whenever it is seen at all. I have heardpeople say they thought they had seen Denali, as I have heard travellerssay they thought they had seen Mount Everest from Darjiling; but no oneever thought he saw Denali if he saw it at all. There is no possiblequestion about it, once the mountain has risen before the eyes; andalthough Mount Everest is but the highest of a number of great peaks,while Denali stands alone in unapproached predominance, yet I think theman who has really looked upon the loftiest mountain in the world couldhave no doubt about it ever after.How my heart burns within me whenever I get view of this great monarchof the North! There it stood, revealed from base to summit in all itsstupendous size, all its glistening majesty. I would far rather climbthat mountain than own the richest gold-mine in Alaska. Yet how itsapparent nearness mocks one; what time and cost and labour are involvedeven in approaching its base with food and equipment for an attempt toreach its summit! How many schemes I have pondered and dreamed theseseven years past for climbing it! Some day time and opportunity andresource may serve, please God, and I may have that one of my heart'sdesires; if not, still it is good to have seen it from many differentcoigns of vantage, from this side and from that; to have felt the awe ofits vast swelling bulk, the superb dignity of its firm-seated,broad-based uplift to the skies with a whole continent for a pedestal;to have gazed eagerly and longingly at its serene, untrodden summit, farabove the eagle's flight, above even the most daring airman's venture,and to have desired and hoped to reach it; to desire and hope to reachit still.[D]Plunging down the steep descent we went for four miles, and then after ahearty dinner at the road-house, essayed to make twenty-one miles moreto the Hot Springs. But night fell again with a number of miles yet tocome, the recent storm had furrowed the trail diagonally with hardwindrows of snow that overturned the sled repeatedly and formed anhindrance that grew greater and greater, and again we made camp in thedark, short of our expected goal.Of late I had been carrying an hip ring, a rubber ring inflated by thebreath that is the best substitute for a mattress. The ring had beenleft behind at Rampart, and so dependent does one grow on the littleluxuries and ameliorations one permits oneself that these two nights incamp were almost sleepless for lack of it.[Sidenote: THE HOT SPRINGS]Three hours more brought us to the spacious hotel, with its forty emptyrooms, that had been put up, out of all sense or keeping, in a wild,plunging attempt to "exploit" the Hot Springs and make a great "healthresort" of the place. The hot water had been piped a quarter of a mileor so to spacious swimming-baths in the hotel; all sorts of expense hadbeen lavished on the place; but it had been a failure from the first,and has since been closed and has fallen into dilapidation. The bottomshave dropped out of the cement baths, the paper hangs drooping from thedamp walls, the unsubstantial foundations have yielded until the floorsare heaved like the waves of the sea.[E] But at this time the hotel wasstill maintained and we stayed there, and its wide entrance-hall andlobby formed an excellent place to gather the inhabitants of the littletown for Divine service--again the only opportunity in the year.What a curious phenomenon thermal springs constitute in these parts!Here is a series of patches of ground, free from snow, while all thecountry has been covered two or three feet deep these four months; greenwith vegetation, while all living things elsewhere are wrapped in wintersleep. Here is open, rushing water, throwing up clouds of steam thatsettles upon everything as dense hoar frost, while all other water isheld in the adamantine fetters of the ice. Where does that constantunfailing stream of water at 110° Fahrenheit come from? Where does itget its heat? I know of half a dozen such thermal springs inAlaska,--one far away above the Arctic Circle between the upper coursesof the Kobuk and the Noatak Rivers, that I have heard strange talesabout from the Esquimaux and that I have always wanted to visit.Whenever I see this gush of hot water in the very midst of the ice andthe snow, I am reminded of my surprise on the top of Mount Tacoma. Wehad climbed some eight thousand feet of snow and were shivering in abitter wind on the summit, yet when the hand was thrust in a cleft ofthe rock it had to be withdrawn by reason of the heat. One knows aboutthe internal fire of some portion of the earth's mass, of course, butsuch striking manifestations of it, such bold irruption of heat in themidst of the kingdom of the cold, must always bring a certainastonishment except to those who take everything as a matter of course.It is evident that this hot water, capable of distribution over aconsiderable area of land, makes an exceedingly favourable condition forsubarctic agriculture, and a great deal of ground has been put undercultivation with large yield of potatoes and cabbage and othervegetables. But the limitations of Alaskan conditions have shorn allprofit from the enterprise. There is no considerable market nearer thanFairbanks, almost two hundred miles away by the river. If the potatoesare allowed to remain in the ground until they are mature, there is thegreatest danger of the whole crop freezing while on the way to market,and in any case the truck-farmers around Fairbanks find that theirproximity to the consumer more than offsets the advantage of the HotSprings.[Sidenote: ARCTIC AGRICULTURE]When the great initial difficulties of farming in Alaska are overcome,when the moss is removed and the ground, frozen solidly to bedrock, isbroken and thawed, when its natural acidity is counteracted by theapplication of some alkali, and its reeking surface moisture is drainedaway; when after three or four years' cultivation it begins to make someadequate return of roots and greens, there remains the constantdifficulty of a market. Around the mining settlements and during theuncertain life of the mining settlements, truck-farming pays very well,but it could easily be overdone so that prices would fall below thepoint of any profit at all. Transportation is expensive, and rates for ashort haul on the rivers are high, out of all proportion to rates forthe long haul from the outside, so that potatoes from the Pacific coastare brought in and sold in competition with the native-grown. Anddespite the protestations of the agricultural experimental stations, theoutside or "chechaco" potato has the advantage of far better qualitythan that grown in Alaska. Tastes differ, and a man may speak only as hefinds. For my part, I have eaten native potatoes raised in almost everysection of interior Alaska, and have been glad to get them, but I havenever eaten a native potato that compared favourably with any good"outside" potato. The native potato is commonly wet and waxy; I havenever seen a native potato that would burst into a glistening mass ofwhite flour, or that had the flavour of a really good potato.There has been much misconception about the interior of Alaska thatobtains yet in some quarters, although there is no excuse for it now.Not only the interior of Alaska, but all land at or near sea-level inthe arctic regions that is not under glacial ice-caps, is snow free andsurface-thawed in the summer and has a luxuriant vegetation. The polarox (Sverdrup's protest against the term "musk-ox" should surely prevail)ranges in great bands north of the 80th parallel and must secureabundant food; and when Peary determined the insularity of Greenland hefound its most northerly point a mass of verdure and flowers.No doubt potatoes and turnips, lettuce and cabbage, could be raisedanywhere in those regions; the intensity of the season compensates forits shortness; the sun is in the heavens twenty-four hours in the day,and all living things sprout and grow with amazing rankness and celerityunder the strong compulsion of his continuous rays. Spring comesliterally with a shout and a rush here in Alaska, and must cry evenlouder and stride even faster in the "ultimate climes of the pole." Ifthe possibility of raising garden-truck and tubers constitutes a"farming country," then all the arctic regions not actually underglacial ice may be so classed.Any one who visits the Koyukuk may see monster turnips and cabbagesraised at Coldfoot, near the 68th parallel; from Sir William Parry'sdescription we may feel quite sure that vegetables of size andexcellence might be raised at the head of Bushnan's Cove of MelvilleIsland, on the 75th parallel; he called it "an arctic paradise"; Greelyreported "grass twenty-four inches high and many butterflies" in theinterior of Grinnell Land under the 82d parallel; and if gold were everdiscovered on the north coast of Greenland one might quite expect tohear that some enterprising Swede was growing turnips and cabbages atCape Morris Jessup above the 83d parallel, and getting a dollar a poundfor them.In favourable seasons and in favourable spots of interior Alaska certainearly varieties of Siberian oats and rye have been matured, and itstands to the credit of the Experiment Station at Rampart that a littlewheat was once ripened there, though it took thirteen months from thesowing to the ripening. When the rest of the world fills up so thateconomic pressure demands the utilisation of all earth that will produceany sort of food, it may be that large tracts in Alaska will be putunder the plough; but it is hard to believe that nine tenths of all thisvast country will ever be other than wild waste land. At present thefarming population is strictly an appendage of the mining population,and the mining population rather diminishes than increases.Your health resort that no one will resort to is a dull place at bestand a poor dependence for merchandising, so that the little town of HotSprings is fortunate in having some mining country around it to fallback upon for its trade. We lay an extra day there, waiting for thestage from Fairbanks to break trail for us through the heavy, driftedsnow, having had enough of trail breaking for a while. At midnight thestage came, two days late, and its coming caused me as keen a sorrow andas great a loss as I have had since I came to Alaska.[Sidenote: NANOOK'S DEATH]We knew naught of it until the next morning, when, breakfast done andthe sled lashed, we were ready to hitch the dogs and depart. They hadbeen put in the horse stable for there was no dog house; the healthresorter, actual or prospective, is not likely to be a dog man onesupposes; but they were loose in the morning and came to the call, allbut one--Nanook. Him we sought high and low, and at last Arthur foundhim, but in what pitiful case! He dragged himself slowly and painfullyalong, his poor bowels hanging down in the outer hide of his belly,fearfully injured internally, done for and killed already. It was notdifficult to account for it. When the horses came in at midnight, one ofthem had kicked the dog and ruptured his whole abdomen.There was no use in inquiring whose fault it was. The dogs should havebeen chained; so much was our fault. But it was hard to resist somebitter recollection that before this "exploitation" of the springs, whenthere was a modest road-house instead of a mammoth hotel, there had beenkennels for dogs instead of nothing but stables for horses.I doubt if all the veterinary surgeons in the world could have saved thedog, but there was none to try; and there was only one thing to do, hateit as we might. Arthur and I were grateful that neither of us had to doit, for the driver of the mail stage, who had some compunctions ofconscience, I think, volunteered to save us the painful duty. "I knowhow you feel," he said slowly and kindly; "I've got a dog I think a heapof myself, but that dog ain't nothin' to me an' I'll do it for you."Nanook knew perfectly well that it was all over with him. Head and taildown, the picture of resigned dejection, he stood like a petrified dog.And when I put my face down to his and said "Good-bye," he licked me forthe first time in his life. In the six years I had owned him and drivenhim I had never felt his tongue before, though I had always loved himbest of the bunch. He was not the licking kind.We hitched up our diminished team and pulled out, for we had thirtymiles to make in the short daylight and we had lost time already; and aswe crossed the bridge over the steaming slough we saw the man goingslowly down to the river with the dog, the chain in one hand, a gun inthe other. My eyes filled with tears; I could not look at Arthur nor heat me as I passed forward to run ahead of the team, and I was glad whenI realised that we had drawn out of ear-shot.All day as I trudged or trotted now on snow-shoes and now off, as thetrail varied in badness, that dog was in my mind and his loss upon myheart, the feel of his tongue upon my cheek. It takes the closecompanionship between a man and his dogs in this country, travelling allthe winter long, winter after winter, through the bitter cold and thestorm and darkness, through the long, pleasant days of the warm sunshineof approaching spring, sharing labour and sharing ease, sharingprivation and sharing plenty; it takes this close companionship to makea man appreciate a dog. As I reckoned it up, Nanook had fallen justshort of pulling my sled ten thousand miles. If he had finished thisseason with me he would have done fully that, and I had intended topension him after this winter, to provide that so long as he lived heshould have his fish and rice every day. Some doubt I had had of oldLingo lasting through the winter, but none of Nanook, and they were theonly survivors of my original team.[Sidenote: THE TALKING DOG]Nanook was in as good spirits as ever I knew him that last night, comingto me and plumping his huge fore paws down on my moccasins, challengingme to play the game of toe treading that he loved; and whenever he beatme at it he would seize my ankle in his jaws and make me hop around onone foot, to his great delight. He was my talking dog. He had moredifferent tones in his bark than any other dog I ever knew. He nevercame to the collar in the morning, he never was released from it atnight, without a cheery "bow-wow-wow." And we never stopped finally tomake camp but he lifted up his voice. There was something curious aboutthat. Only two nights before, when we had been unable to reach thehealth resort owing to wind-hardened drifts right across the trail thatoverturned the heavy sled again and again, swing the gee pole as onewould, and had stopped several times in the growing dusk to inspect aspot that seemed to promise a camping place, Arthur had remarked thatNanook never spoke until the spot was reached on which we decided topitch the tent. What faculty he had of recognising a good place, ofseeing that both green spruce and dry spruce were there in sufficientquantity, I do not know--or whether he got his cue from the tones of ourvoice--but he never failed to give tongue when the stop was final andnever opened his mouth when it was but tentative.I could almost tell the nature of any disturbance that arose from thetone of Nanook's bark. Was it some stray Indian dog prowling round thecamp; was it the distant howling of wolves; was it the approach of somebelated traveller--there was a distinct difference in the way heannounced each. I well remember the new note that came into hispassionate protest when he was chained to a stump at the reindeer camp,and the foolish creatures streamed all over the camping-ground thatnight. To have them right beside him and yet be unable to reach them, tohave them brushing him with their antlers while he strained helplesslyat the chain, was adding insult to injury. And he kept me awake over itall night and told me about it at intervals all next day.The coat that dog had was the heaviest and thickest I ever saw. On hisback the long hair parted in the middle, and underneath the hair was furand underneath the fur was wool. He was an outdoors dog strictly. It wasonly in the last year or two that he could be induced voluntarily toenter a house; he seemed, like Mowgli, to have a suspicion of houses.And if he did come in he had no respect for the house at all. When firstI had him he would dig and scratch out of a dog-house on the coldestnight, if he could, and lay himself down comfortably on the snow. Coldmeant little to him. Fifty, sixty, seventy below zero, all night long atsuch temperatures he would sleep quite contentedly. The only differenceI could see that these low temperatures made to him was an increasingdislike to be disturbed. When he had carefully tucked his nose betweenhis paws and adjusted his tail over all, he had gone to bed, and to makehim take his nose out of its nest and uncurl himself was like throwingthe clothes off a sleeping man. He never dug a hole for himself in thesnow. I never saw a dog do that yet. In my opinion that is one of thenature-faker's stories. A dog lies in snow just as he lies in sand, withthe same preliminary turn-round-three-times that has been so muchspeculated about. We always make a bed for them, when it is very cold,by cutting and stripping a few spruce boughs, and they highly appreciatesuch a couch and will growl and fight if another dog try to take it.They need more food and particularly they need more fat when they lieout at extreme low temperatures, and we seek to increase that element intheir rations by adding tallow or bacon or bear's-grease--or sealoil--or whatever oleaginous substance we can come by.[Sidenote: CANINE CHARACTER]He was a most independent dog was Nanook, a thoroughly bad dog, as onewould say in some use of that term--a thief who had no shame in histhievery but rather gloried in it. If you left anything edible withinhis ingenious and comprehensive reach he regarded it as a challenge.There comes to me a ludicrous incident that concerned a companion of onewinter journey. He had carefully prepared a lunch and had wrapped itneatly in paper, and he placed it for a moment on the sled while heturned to put his scarf about him. But in that moment Nanook saw it andit was gone. Through the snow, over the brush, in and out amongst thestumps the chase proceeded, until Nanook was finally caught and mycompanion recovered most of the paper, for the dog had wolfed the grubas he ran. He would stand and take any licking you offered and neverutter a sound but give a bark of defiance when you were done, and hewould bear you no ill will in the world and repeat his offence at thenext opportunity. Yet so absurdly sensitive was he in other matters ofhis person that the simple operation of clipping the hair from betweenhis toes, to prevent the "balling-up" of the snow, took two men toperform, one to sit on the dog and the other to ply the scissors, andwas accompanied always with such howls and squeals as would make ahearer think we were flaying him alive.Nanook's acquaintance with horses began in Fairbanks the first season Iowned him, before I had had the harness upon him, when he was rising twoyears old. The dogs and I were staying at the hospital we had justestablished--because in those days there was nowhere else tostay--waiting for the winter. One of the mining magnates of the infancyof the camp (broken and dead long since; Bret Harte's lines, "Bustedhimself in White Pine and blew out his brains down in 'Frisco," oftenoccur to me as the sordid histories of to-day repeat those of fiftyyears ago) had imported a saddle-horse and, as the mild days of thatcharming autumn still deferred the snow, he used to ride out past thehospital for a canter.The dog had learned to lift the latch of the gate of the hospital yardwith his nose and get out, and when I put a wedge above the latch forgreater security he learned also to circumvent that precaution. Andwhenever the horse and his rider passed, Nanook would open the gate andlead the whole pack in a noisy pursuit that changed the canter to a runand brought us natural but mortifying remonstrance.The rider had just passed and the dogs had pursued as usual, and I hadrushed out and recalled them with difficulty. Nanook I had by thecollar. Dragging him into the yard, shutting the gate, and putting inthe wedge, I picked up a stick and gave him a few sharp blows with it.Then flinging him off, I said: "Now, you stay in here; I'll give you asound thrashing if you do that again!" I was just getting acquaintedwith him then. The moment I loosed his collar the dog went deliberatelyto the gate, stood on his hind legs while he pulled out the wedge withhis teeth, lifted the latch with his nose and swung open the gate, andstanding in the midst turned round and said to me: "Bow-_wow_-wow-wow-wow-_wow_!"It was so pointed that a passer-by, who had paused to see theproceedings and was leaning on the fence, said to me: "Well, you knowwhere _you_ can go to. That's the doggonedest dog I ever seen!"[Sidenote: PARTNERS]It was a pleasure to come back to Nanook after any long absence--apleasure I was used to look forward to. There was no special fawning ordemonstration of affection; he was not that kind; that I might have fromany of the others; but from none but Nanook the bark of welcome with myparticular inflection in it that no one else ever got. "Well, well;here's the boss again; glad to see you back"; that was about all itsaid. For he was a most independent dog and took to himself an air ofpartnership rather than subjection. Any man can make friends with anydog if he will, there is no question about that, but it takes a longtime and mutual trust and mutual forbearance and mutual appreciation tomake a partnership. Not every dog is fit to be partner with a man; norevery man, I think, fit to be partner with a dog.Well, that long partnership was dissolved by the horse's hoof and I wassore for its dissolution. There was none left now that could rememberthe old days of the team save Lingo, and he grew crusty and somewhatcrabbed. He was still the guardian of the sled, still the insatiablehand-shaker, but he grew more and more unsocial with his mates, and weheard his short, sharp, angry double bark at night more frequently thanwe used to. He reminded me of the complaining owl in Gray's "Elegy." Heresented any dog even approaching the sled, resented the dogs movingabout at all to disturb his "ancient solitary reign."His work was well-nigh done, and old Lingo had honestly earned his rest.With the end of this winter he would enter upon the easy old age that Ihad designed for both of them. Lingo had never failed me; never let histraces slack if he could keep them taut, never in his life had whip laidon his back to make him pull; a faithful old work dog for whom I had ahearty respect and regard. But he never found his way to my heart asNanook did. I loved Nanook, and had lost something personal out of mylife in losing him. There are other dogs that I am fond of--better dogsin some ways that either Nanook or Lingo, swifter certainly--but I thinkI shall never have two dogs again that have meant as much to me as thesetwo. All the other dogs were of the last two years and thought theybelonged to Arthur, who fed them and handled them most. But Nanook andLingo had seen boys come and boys go, and they knew better.Six years is not very much of a man's life, but it is all a dog's life;all his effective working life. Nanook had given it all to me,willingly, gladly. He pulled so freely because he loved to pull. Hedelighted in the winter, in the snow and the cold; rejoiced to be on thetrail, rejoiced to work. When we made ready to depart after a few daysat a mission or in a town, Nanook was beside himself with joy. He wouldburst forth into song as he saw the preparations in hand, would run allup and down the gamut of his singular flexible voice, would tell asplainly to all around as though he spoke it in English and Indian andEsquimau that the inaction had irked him, that he was eager to be goneagain.Well, he was dead; as fine a dog as ever lived; as faithful andintelligent a creature as any man ever had, not of human race, forservant, companion, and friend. And I thought the more of myself that hehad put his tongue to my cheek when I said good-bye to him.       *       *       *       *       *[Sidenote: THE AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER]Here on the Tanana was one of the most interesting original charactersof the many in the land: an old inhabitant of Alaska and of theNorthwest who had followed many avocations and was now settled down onthe river bank, with a steamboat wood-yard, a road-house for theentertainment of occasional travellers, and a little stock of tradegoods chiefly for Indians of the vicinity. A round, fat, pursy man hewas, past the middle life, with a twinkling eye and a bristlingmoustache, and a most amazing knack of picking up new words and usingthem incorrectly. He had fallen out with the great trading company ofAlaska and did almost all his purchasing from a "mail-order house" inChicago, the enormous quarto catalogue on the flimsiest thin paperissued by that establishment being his chief book of reference and hischoice continual reading. He would declaim by the hour on the iniquitousprices that prevail in the interior and had the quotations of prices ofevery conceivable merchandise from his _vade mecum_ at his fingers'ends.But his chief passion of the past two or three years was photography, inthe which he had made but little progress, despite considerableexpenditures; and he had come to the conclusion about the time of ourvisit that what he needed was a fine lens, although, as a matter offact, he had never learned to use his cheap one. He had recently becomeacquainted with sensitive film and had ordered a supply. By atransposition of letters, which the nature of the substance doubtlessconfirmed in his mind when it arrived, he always spoke of theseconvenient strips of celluloid as "flims," and was just now mosteloquently indignant that, although he had broken utterly with theNorthern Commercial Company and refused to trade with them at all, thesupply of "flims" he had received from the mail-order house werelabelled "N. C." "Them blamed monopolists has cornered the flims," heexclaimed, and was hardly persuaded that the letters signified"non-curling" and did not darkly hint at a conspiracy in restraint oftrade.He produced and displayed a number of pieces of apparatus of a generallyuseless kind which he had ordered on the strength of their muchadvertising, and he observed sententiously, "We _armatures_ get badlyimposed upon." Here were patent gimcrack printing devices, although hehad scarce anything worth printing; all sorts of atrocious fancy borderswith which he sought in vain to embellish out-of-focus under-exposures;orthochromatic filters and colour screens with which he was eliminatingundesirable rays, although the chief thing his negatives lacked waslight of any kind. His soiled and stained development trays werescattered about a large table amidst dirty cups and saucers and platesand dishes, while at the other end of the table, surmounting a pile ofthumbed and greasy magazines and newspapers, lay the monstrousmail-order catalogue with pencilled indications of further apparatus tobe purchased.But his zeal and enthusiasm and resolute riding of his hobby were veryattractive. If he ever gets out of his head the notion that successdepends upon apparatus he will doubtless become a photographer of sorts.Enthusiasm of any kind other than mining and "mushing" enthusiasm is sorare in this land that it is welcome even when it seems wasted. He hadrecently discovered the wax match in his catalogue, and as a partinggift he presented me with a box of "them there wax _vespers_ which beatsthe sulphur match all to thunder."[Sidenote: THE SULPHUR MATCH]But they do not. Nothing in this country can take the place of theold-fashioned sulphur match, long since banished from civilisedcommunities, and the sulphur match is the only match a man upon thetrail will employ. Manufactured from blocks of wood without completeseverance, so that the ends of the matches are still held together atthe bottom in one solid mass, it is easy to strip one off at need andstrike it upon the block. A block of a hundred such matches will take upmuch less space than fifty of any other kind of match, and the blocksmay be freely carried in any as they are commonly carried in everypocket without fear of accidental ignition. The only fire producer thatit is worth while supplementing the sulphur match with is the evenolder-fashioned flint and steel, which to a man who smokes is aconvenience in a wind. All the modern alcohol and gasoline pocketdevices are extinguished by the lightest puff of wind, but the tinder,once ignited, burns the fiercer for the blast. With dry, shreddedbirch-bark I have made a fire upon occasion from the flint and steel.One resource may here be mentioned, since we are on the subject, whichis always carried in the hind-sack of my sled against difficulty in firemaking. It is a tin tobacco-box filled with strips of cotton cloth cutto the size of the box and the whole saturated with kerosene. One or twoof these strips will help very greatly in kindling a fire when damptwigs or shavings are all that are at hand. A few camphor balls (theordinary "moth balls") will serve equally well; and there may come atime, on any long journey, when the forethought that has provided suchaid will be looked back upon with very great satisfaction.       *       *       *       *       *The mail trail from Tanana to Fairbanks touches the Tanana River only atone point, a few miles beyond the Hot Springs; but, as we wished tovisit Nenana, we had to leave the mail trail after two days more ofuneventful travel and strike out to the river and over its surface forseventeen or eighteen miles.[Sidenote: A NOTABLE GENTLEWOMAN]Nenana is a native village situated on the left bank of the Tanana, alittle above the confluence of the Nenana River with that stream, and wehave established an important and flourishing school there whichreceives its forty pupils from many points on the Yukon and TananaRivers. None but thoroughly sound and healthy children of promise, fullnatives or half-breeds, are received at the school, and we seek to giveboth boys and girls opportunity for the cultivation of the native artsand for some of the white man's industrial training, in addition to theordinary work of the schoolroom. The school was started and had the goodfortune of its first four years' life under the care of a notablegentlewoman, Miss Annie Cragg Farthing, who was yet at its head at thetime of this visit, but who died suddenly, a martyr to her devotion tothe children, a year later; and a great Celtic cross in concrete,standing high on the bluff across the river, now marks the spot of herown selection--a spot that gives a fine view of Denali--where her bodyrests, and also the Alaskan mission's sense of the extraordinary valueof her life.It would be easy to give striking instances of the potency and stretchof this remarkable woman's influence amongst the native people, aninfluence--strange as it may sound to those who deem any half-educated,under-bred white woman competent to take charge of an Indian school--dueas much to her wide culture, her perfect dignity and self-possession,her high breeding, as to the love and consecrated enthusiasm of hercharacter. It is no exaggeration to say that Miss Farthing's work hasleft a mark broad and deep upon the Indian race of this whole regionthat will never be wiped out.There is no greater pleasure than to spend a few days at this school; toforegather again with so many of the hopeful young scamps that one hasoneself selected here and there and brought to the place; to mark theimprovement in them, the taming and gentling, the drawing out of thesweet side of the nature that is commonly buried to the casual observerin the rudeness and shyness of savage childhood. To romp with them, totell them tales and jingles, to get insensibly back into their familiarconfidence again, to say the evening prayers with them, to join withtheir clear, fresh voices in the hymns and chants, is indeed torejuvenate oneself. And to go away believing that real strength ofcharacter is developing, that real preparation is making for an Indianrace that shall be a better Indian race and not an imitation white race,is the cure for the discouragement that must sometimes come to all thosewho are committed heart and soul to the cause of the Alaskan native.School-teachers, it would seem, ought never to grow old; they shouldsuck in new youth continually from the young life around them; andchildren are far and away the most interesting things in the world, moreinteresting even than dogs and great mountains.[Sidenote: CHIVALROUS INDIAN YOUTH]All the boys in the school, I think, swarmed across the river with uswhen we started away early in the morning, and the elder ones ran withthe sled along the portage, mile after mile, until I turned them backlest they be late for school.But when they were gone, still I saw them, saw them gathered round thegrey-haired lady I had left, fawning upon her with their eyes, theirhearts filled with as true chivalry as ever animated knight or championof the olden time. Tall, upstanding fellows of sixteen or seventeen,clean-limbed and broad-shouldered, wild-run all their lives; hunters,with a tale of big game to the credit of some of them would make anEnglish sportsman envious; unaccustomed to any restraint at all andprone to chafe at the slightest; unaccustomed to any respect for women,to any of the courtesies of life, I saw them fly at a word, at a look,to do her bidding, saw cap snatched from head if they encountered herabout the buildings, saw them jump up and hold open the door if shemoved to pass out of a room, saw the eager devotion that would haveserved her upon bended knee had they thought it would please her. It waswonderful, the only thing of quite its kind I had ever seen in my life.When early in the school's history an old medicine-man at Nenana hadbeen roused to animosity by her refusal to countenance an offensiveIndian custom touching the adolescent girls, and had defiantly announcedhis intention to make medicine against her, I can see her now, her staffin her hand, attended by two or three of her devoted youths, invadingthe midnight pavilion of the conjurer, in the very midst of hisconjurations, tossing his paraphernalia outside, laying her staffsmartly across the shoulders of the trembling shaman, and driving thegaping crew helter-skelter before her, their awe of the witchcraftoverawed by her commanding presence. I make no apology that I thought ofthe scourge of small cords that was used on an occasion in the temple atJerusalem, when I heard of it. It gave a shrewder blow to the lingeringtyrannical superstition of the medicine-man than decades of preachingand reasoning would have done. No man living could have done the thingwith like effect, nor any woman save one of her complete self-possessionand natural authority. The younger villagers chuckle over the jest of itto this day, and the old witch-doctor himself was crouching at her feetand, as one may say, eating out of her hand, within the year.I saw these boys again, in my mind's eye, gone back to their homes hereand there on the Yukon and the Tanana after their two or three years atthis school, carrying with them some better ideal of human life thanthey could ever get from the elders of the tribe, from the little sordidvillage trader, from most of the whites they would be thrown with,keeping something of the vision of gentle womanhood, something of the"unbought grace of life," something of the keen sense of truth andhonour, of the nobility of service, something deeper and stronger thanmere words of the love of God, which they had learned of her whom theyall revered; each one, however much overflowed again by the surroundingwaters of mere animal living, tending a little shrine of sweeter andbetter things in his heart.[Sidenote: LONG-REMEMBERED TEACHING]Here, three years after the visit and the journey narrated, when thesewords are written with diaries and letters and memoranda around me, I amjust come from a long native powwow, a meeting of all the Indians of avillage for the annual election of a village council, important in theevolution of that self-government we covet for these people, butundeniably tedious. And, because at our missions we seek to associatewith us every force that looks to the betterment of the natives, we hadinvited the new government teacher, a lady of long experience in Indianschools, to be present. She had sat patiently through the protractedmeeting, and at its close, when she rose to go, a young Indian manjumped up and held her fur cloak for her and put it gently about hershoulders. When she had thanked him she asked with a smile: "Where didyou learn to be so polite?" A gleam came into the fellow's eyes, then hedropped them and replied, "Miss Farthing taught me."Two days before, returning from a journey, I had spent the night at aroad-house kept by a white man married to an Indian woman. There wasexcellent yeast bread on the table, and good bread is a rare thing inAlaska. "Where did you learn to make such good bread?" I inquired of thewoman. There came the same light to her eyes and the same answer to herlips. Yet it was nine years ago, long before the school at Nenana wasstarted, that this Indian boy and girl had been under Miss Farthing'steaching at Circle City.They tell us there is no longer much place or use for gentility in theworld, for men and women nurtured and refined above the common level;tell us in particular that woman is only now emancipating herself fromcenturies of ineffectual nonage, only now entering upon her activecareer.Yet I am of opinion, from such opportunities to observe and compare asmy constant travel has given me, that the quiet work of this graciouswoman of the old school, with her dignity that nothing ever invaded andher poise that nothing ever disturbed, is perhaps the most powerfulsingle influence that has come into the lives of the natives of interiorAlaska.Two days brought us past the little native village and mission at Chena(which is pronounced Shen-aẁ), past the little white town of the samename, to Fairbanks, the chief town of interior Alaska. Chena is at thevirtual head of the navigation of the Tanana River and is quite as nearto the gold-producing creeks as Fairbanks, which latter place is not onthe Tanana River at all but on a slough, impracticable for almost anycraft at low water. For every topographical reason, from everyconsideration of natural advantage, Chena should have been the riverport and town of these gold-fields. But Chena was so sure of hermanifold natural advantages that she became unduly confident andgrasping. When the traders at Fairbanks offered to remove to Chena atthe beginning of the camp, if the traders at Chena would provide a site,the offer was scornfully rejected. "They would have to come, anyway, orgo out of business." But they did not come; rather they put their backsup and fought. And because Fairbanks was enterprising and far-sighted,while Chena was avaricious and narrow, because Fairbanks offered freesites and Chena charged enormously for water-front, business went theten miles up the often unnavigable slough and settled there, and by andby built a little railway that it might be independent of the uncertainboat service. The company came, the courts came, the hospital came, thechurches came, and Chena woke up from its dreams of easy wealth to finditself and its manifold natural advantages passed by and ignored and thebig town firmly established elsewhere.How well I remember the virulent little newspaper published at Chena inthose days and the bitterness and vituperation it used to pour out weekby week! One wishes a file of it had been preserved. Alaskan journalismhas presented many amusing curiosities that no one has had leisure tocollect, but nothing more amusing than the frenzy of impotent wrathChena vented when it saw its cherished prospects and opportunitiesslipping out of its grasp for ever.        "If of all words on tongue or pen,         The saddest are 'it might have been,'         Full sad are those we often see,         It is, but it hadn't ought to be."It takes Bret Harte to strike the note for such rivalry and suchdisappointment.FOOTNOTES:[C] In December, 1912, a determined effort was made by the betterelement of the little handful of white people in this town to secure thewithdrawal of the licence of this saloon. The justice of the peace, thegovernment school-teacher, the postmaster, and others went up toFairbanks (a week's journey over the trail) and opposed the granting ofthe licence in court. It was shown that the white men of the localitywere so reduced in numbers that the business could not be carried on ata profit unless liquor was sold, directly or indirectly, to the Indians.But because by hook and by crook the names of a majority of one or twoof all the white residents of the precinct were secured for a petitionin favour of the licence (two or three were secured by telegraph at thelast moment) the judge held that he had no option under the law but togrant the licence. So, on the one hand, it is a felony to sell liquor toIndians, and annually thousands of dollars are expended in trying tosuppress such sale, while, on the other hand, a man is licenced to sellliquor when it is shown that he cannot make a living unless he sells toIndians; that is to say he is virtually granted a licence to sell toIndians. This note is not intended to reflect upon the judge who grantedthe licence, although all his predecessors have not put thatconstruction upon the law, but upon a law open to that construction.[D] This was written some two years before the opportunity came. On the7th of June, 1913, the writer and three companions reached the summit ofDenali. ("The Ascent of Denali," Charles Scribner's Sons, 1914.)[E] In 1913 it was finally destroyed by fire.CHAPTER IXTANANA CROSSING TO FORTYMILE AND DOWN THE YUKON--A PATRIARCHALCHIEF--SWARMING CARIBOU--EAGLE AND FORT EGBERT--CIRCLE CITY AND FORTYUKONFAIRBANKS was a different place in 1910 from the centre of feverishtrade and feverish vice of 1904-5, when the stores were open all day andhalf the night and the dance-halls and gambling dens all night and halfthe day; when the Jews cornered all the salt and all the sugar in thecamp and the gamblers all the silver and currency; when the curiousnotion prevailed that in some mysterious way general profligacy was goodfor business, and the Commercial Club held an indignation meeting upon athreat of closing down the public gaming and refusing liquor licences tothe dance-halls, and voted unanimously in favour of an "open town"; whena diamond star was presented to the "chief of police" by the enforcedcontributions of the prostitutes; when the weekly gold-dust from theclean-ups on the creeks came picturesquely into town escorted byhorsemen armed to the teeth. The outward and visible signs of the WildWest are gone; the dance-halls and gambling tables are a thing of thepast; the creeks are all connected with Fairbanks by railway andtelephone; an early closing movement has prevailed in the shops; andthe local choral society is lamenting the customary dearth of tenors forits production of "The Messiah."Despite the steady decline in the gold output of late years, a drop offrom twenty millions down to four or five, there is little visible decayin its trade, and despite stampedes to new diggings all over Alaska,there is no marked visible diminution in its population, though as amatter of fact both must have largely fallen off. The thing that morethan any other has sustained the spirits and retained the presence ofthe business men is the expectation that seems to grow brighter andbrighter, of the development of a quartz camp now that the placers arebeing exhausted. And in that hope lies the chance of Fairbanks to becomethe one permanent considerable town of interior Alaska. It is asubstantial place, with good business houses and many comfortable homeselectric-lit, steam-heated, well protected against fire--better thanagainst flood--and, though it does not display the style and luxury ofthe palmy days of Nome, it has amenities enough to make disinterestedvisitors and passers-by wish that its hard-rock hopes may be realised.[Sidenote: FAIRBANKS]The little log church that is still, as a local artist put it, "the onlything in Fairbanks worth making a picture of," no longer stands open allday and all night as the town's library and reading-room, but haswithdrawn into decorous Sabbath use in favour of the commodious publiclibrary built by a Philadelphia churchman; the hospital adjoining it,that for two or three years cared for all the sick of the camp, issupplemented by another and a larger across the slough; youngbirch-trees have been successfully planted all along the principalstreets, and the front yards everywhere are ablaze with flowers thesummer through. You may eat hot-house lettuce and radishes in March;hot-house strawberries (at about ten cents apiece) in July and August;while common outdoor garden-truck of all kinds is plentiful and good inits short season.We had another canine misfortune while we lay there. Doc, one of ourleaders, got his chain twisted around his foot the night before we wereto leave, and, in pulling to free it, stopped the circulation of theblood and the foot froze. It was as hard as wood and sounded like woodwhen it hit the sidewalks, from which the snow had been cleared, as thedog came limping along. An hour's soaking in cold water drew the frostout of the foot, and we swathed it in cotton saturated with carron oil,upon which it swelled so greatly that it was impossible to tell theextent of the injury or to determine whether or not the dog would everbe of use again. A kindly nurse at the hospital undertook his care, andwe left him behind. One does not buy a dog so late in the season, withall the idle summer to feed him through, if any shift can be made toavoid it, and there was a Great Dane pup at the Salchaket, forty milesaway, that I might pick up as I passed and perhaps make some use of forthe remainder of the winter.That mission was the next stop on our journey, and we reached it overthe level mail trail, the chief winter highway of Alaska, connectingFairbanks with Valdez on the coast. Three times a week there is a horsestage with mail and passengers passing over this trail each way,together with much other travel. The Alaska Road Commission has lavishedlarge sums of money upon it, and the four hundred miles or thereabout ismade in a week.[Sidenote: THE SALCHAKET]A day and a half brought us to the Salchaket, one of a chain of missionsalong the Tanana River, established by the energy and zeal of theReverend Charles Eugene Betticher, Jr., during his incumbency atFairbanks, that have already brought a great change for the better innative conditions. Five years had elapsed since last I visited thistribe, a reconnoitring visit on one of the first steamboats that everwent up the Tanana River above Fairbanks, and it was a delight to seethe new, clean village with the little gardens round the cabins, and tonote the appreciative attitude which the Indians showed. So highly dothey value the missionary nurse in charge that however far afield theirhunting may lead them, one of their number is sent back every week tosee that the mission does not lack wood and water and meat; a simple,docile, kindly people that one's heart warms to.This mission was our last outpost to the south. My farther journey hadfor its prime object the visiting of the natives of the upper Tanana asfar as the Tanana Crossing, some two hundred and fifty miles beyond theSalchaket, the inquiring into their condition and into the desirabilityof establishing a post amongst them.[Sidenote: THE UPPER TANANA]The upper Tanana is probably one of the most difficult streams in theworld to navigate that can by any stretch of the term be callednavigable. The great Alaskan range begins to approach the Tanana Riverso soon as one gets above Fairbanks. Its prominent peaks, ten thousandto twelve thousand feet high, are continually in view from one angle toanother as one pursues the river trail, and come constantly nearer andnearer. All the streams that are confluent with the Tanana on its leftbank are glacial streams draining the high ice of these mountains. Theycome down laden thick with silt, at times foaming torrents, at timesmerely trickling watercourses that seam with numerous small runnels thewide deltas at their mouths. The tributaries of the right bank flow forthe most part through heavily wooded country, and come out cleanly intothe river. So the glacial waters form shoals and bars, and the woodlandwaters during freshets pile them high with driftwood. Such is the chiefcharacteristic of the upper Tanana; a multiplicity of swift, narrowchannels amidst bars laden with drift. It is subject to sudden rises ofgreat violence; the attempt to stem a freshet on the upper Tanana is ahair-raising experience as the log of the _Pelican_ would show, but doesnot come within this narrative. Owing to the origin of much of itswater, the Tanana is often in flood in dry, hot seasons, when otherrivers run meagrely, as well as in times of rain. It cannot be stemmedin flood; its shoals deny passage in drouth; there must be just theright stage of water to permit its navigation, and that stage, "withouto'erflowing, full," is not often found of duration to serve the voyageafter the month of June.A river difficult to navigate in summer is usually a river difficult totravel upon in winter, and the upper Tanana is notoriously dangerous andtreacherous. Scarce a winter or a summer that it does not claim victims.It is emphatically a "bad river." Therefore, as far as there is anytravel to speak of, land trails parallel the river. Past Richardsonwhere the next night is spent, a decayed mining and trading town thatdates back to the stampedes of 1905-6 when it was thought the upperTanana would prove rich in gold, past Tenderfoot Creek on which thediscoveries were made, past the mouth of the Big Delta with the greatbluff on the opposite shore and the rushing black water at its foot thatnever entirely closes all the winter, and on the other hand the widebarrens of the Big Delta itself giving the whole fine sweep of theAlaskan range, we came at length to McCarthy's, the last telegraphstation on the river,--for the line strikes across country thence toValdez following the government trail,--and there spent another night,and here we leave the government-made trail and take to the riversurface and the wilderness.[Illustration: A PLEASANT WOODLAND TRAIL.][Illustration: AN ALASKAN CHIEF AND HIS HENCHMAN.]Twelve miles through the woods along the left bank of the river broughtus to the aptly named Clearwater Creek, a tributary that comes only fromthe foot-hills and carries no glacial water. This stream by reason ofhot springs runs wide open all the winter and must be crossed by aferry--a raft on a heavy wire. The man who owned the ferry and the houseadjacent was gone from home, so we proceeded to cross as best we could.The raft was so small that first we took the dogs across then unloadedthe sled and took part of the load, and returned for the remainderand the sled itself. Finally a canoe was loaded on the raft and, when ithad been moored on the side we found it, Arthur paddled himself back. Itwas a strange scene, rafting and paddling a canoe in interior Alaska onthe 2d of March, with the thermometer at -15°. Some eight miles fartheralong the portage trail we came to a little cabin about dusk, butdisdaining its dirt and darkness we pitched our tent.Another eighteen miles the next day is noted in my diary for pleasantwoodland travel and for the particular interest of the numerous animaltracks we passed. Here a moose had crossed the trail, ploughing throughthe snow like a great cart-horse; here for two or three miles a lynx hadurgent business in the direction of the Healy River. A lynx will alwaysfollow a trail if there be one, and will pick out the best going on theice or snow in the absence of trail. I once followed a lynx track fromthe head of the Dall River to its mouth, and, save for turning asideoccasionally to investigate a clump of willows or brush, the lynx was anexcellent guide. Here were rabbit tracks and every now and then thelittle sharp tracks of a squirrel. We stopped for lunch under a tallcottonwood-tree, and Arthur pointed out that the trunk, up to a highcrotch, was all seamed by bear claws. He said that the black bearclimbed the same tree season after season, and told me that, accordingto the Indians, this was chiefly done when first he came from his winterden,--for the purpose of getting his bearings, as the boy suggested witha chuckle. A fox, a marten, and a weasel had all passed across lately,and of course then came the exclamation that scarce fails from nativelips when a fox track is seen: "I wonder if it were a black fox!" Ablack fox means sudden wealth beyond the dreams of avarice to an Indian,and any fox track may be the track of a black fox.The end of that portage brought us out on the Tanana River opposite thelittle trading-post at the mouth of the Healy--the last post of any kindwe should see.[Sidenote: INDIAN TRADERS]The trader, by whom we were hospitably entertained, had heard of ourprojected occupation of the upper Tanana, and alert to his owninterests, was anxious to know the plans for the establishment of amission--plans which were yet all to make. He naturally favoured thisspot, which it was already plain was quite out of the question, butprofessed his readiness to move to any place that we might decide upon,and his entire sympathy and co-operation.The question of the trader, which always arises upon the establishmentof a new mission site, is an important and sometimes a vexatious one,for he wields an influence amongst the Indians second only to that ofthe mission itself, and may be either a great help or a great hindrance.There is a natural desire to secure a man of character for the new post,and at the same time a natural reluctance to disturb vested interestsand arouse bitter enmity by diverting trade. The suggestion has oftenbeen made that the mission should itself undertake a store in theinterest of the natives, but those with most experience in such matterswill agree that it is the wisdom of the bishop that sets his faceagainst mission trading. The two offices are so essentially dissimilaras to be almost incompatible with one another; either the person incharge is a missionary first and a trader afterwards, in which case thestore suffers, or he is a trader first and a missionary afterwards, inwhich case he is not a missionary at all. A clean, sober, and honesttrader, content to take his time about getting rich, is a blessing to anIndian community. There are some such, one thinks, but they are notnumerous. The profits are large, though the turnover is but one a year;the capital required is small; it is a life with much leisure; but inthe main it attracts only a certain class of men.A band of Indians to whom word of our visit had been sent had come downthe river this far to meet us and escort us, but dog food was scarce andour arrival was delayed, and they had been compelled to return to theirhunting camp whither we must follow them. We were now farther up theTanana River than either of us had ever been before; the country had thefascination of a new country; every bend of the river held unknownpossibilities, and the keenness and elation that only the penetration ofa new country brings were upon the boy as well as upon myself.The river and the mountains were already drawn much closer together, andas we pursued our journey upon the one we had continual fine views ofthe other. The going was good--too good--for much of it was new ice andspoke of recent overflow, and all too soon we came upon the water. Atthe mouth of the Johnson River, one of the glacial streams, the wholeriver was overflowed, and we waded for a mile through water thatdeepened continually until there was risk of wetting our load. Then wewere compelled to take to the woods and to cut a portage around theworst and deepest of it, and so passed beyond it to good ice and to anempty cabin where we spent the night, glad to be sheltered from anexceedingly bitter wind that had blown all day and had taken all thepleasure out of travel.[Sidenote: THE THERMOS BOTTLES]It is in such weather particularly that the thermos flasks prove such aboon to the musher. To stop and build a fire in the wind means to getchilled through. There is no pleasure in it at all, and I would ratherpush on until the day's journey is done. But the native boy must havehis lunch, and will build a fire in any sort of weather and make a potof tea. The thermos bottle, with its boiling-hot cocoa, gives one thestimulation and nourishment that are desired without stopping for morethan a few moments. I have carried a pair of these bottles all day at60° below zero, and, when opened, snow had to be put into the cocoabefore it was cool enough to drink. Of course it is perfectlysimple--all the astonishing things are--but I never open one of thosebottles in the cold weather and pour out its contents without marvellingat it.We left the river and struck inland towards the foot-hills of theAlaskan range, a long, rough journey over a trail that had been made bythe band that came out to the Healy to meet us, and had been travelledno more than by their coming and going. The snow in this region had beenas much lighter than usual as the snow in the Koyukuk had been heavier.Through the tangle of prostrate trunks of a burned-over forest and thedense underbrush that follows such a fire, with not enough snow to givesmooth passage over the obstacles, we made our toilsome way, the labourof the dogs calling for the continual supplement of the men, one at thegee pole and one at the handle-bars. Some twenty miles, perhaps, a longday's continuous journey, we pushed laboriously into the hills and thenpitched our tent; but in a few miles, next morning, we had struck themain Indian trail from the village near the Tanana Crossing, by whichthe hunting party had come, and what little was left of the journey wenteasily enough until we reached the considerable native encampment.The men were all gone after moose save one half-naked, blear-eyed oldparalytic, a dreadful creature who shambled and hobbled up asking fortobacco. The women were expecting us, however, and took the encampingout of our hands entirely, setting up the tent, hauling stove wood andsplitting it up, making our couch of spruce boughs, starting a fire, andbringing a plentiful present of moose and caribou meat for ourselves andour dogs. Nothing could have been kinder than our reception; the fullhospitality of the wilderness was heaped upon us. It was not until darkthat the men returned, and we had all the afternoon to get acquaintedwith the women and children. Already the chief difficulty we had toencounter presented itself. These people did not speak the language ofthe lower Tanana and middle Yukon--Arthur's language--at all. Theirspeech had much more affinity with the upper Yukon language, and itdawned upon me that they were not of the migration that had pushed upthe Tanana River from the Yukon, as all the natives as far as theSalchaket certainly did, were not of that tribe or that movement at all,but had come across country by the Ketchumstock from the neighbourhoodof Eagle--the route we should return to the Yukon by--and were of thePorcupine and Peel River stock. This was certainly a surprise; I haddeemed all the Tanana River Indians of the same extraction and tongue,but the stretch of bad water from the Salchaket to the Tanana Crossingwas evidently the boundary between two peoples.[Sidenote: CHIEF ISAAC]That night we met Chief Isaac and the principal men of his tribe. Atfirst it seemed that such broken English as three or four of them hadwould be our only medium of intercourse, but later one was discoveredwho had visited the lower Tanana and the Yukon and who understood Arthurindifferently well, and by the double interpretation, halting andinefficient, but growing somewhat better as we proceeded, it waspossible to enter into communication. These preliminaries arranged, thechief made a set speech of dignity and force. He thanked me for comingto them, and regretted he had not been able to wait longer at the HealyRiver to help us to his camp. When he was a boy he had been across tothe Yukon and had seen Bishop Bompas, and had been taught and baptizedby him, but he was an old man now and he had forgotten what he hadlearned. I was the first minister most of his people had ever seen. Theyheard that Indians in other places had mission and school, and they hadfelt sorry a long time that no one came to teach them; for they werevery ignorant, little children who knew nothing, and when they heard arumour that a mission and school would be brought to them their heartswere very glad. Wherever we should see fit to "make mission," there heand his people would go, and would help build for us and help us inevery way; but he hoped it would be near Lake Mansfield and theCrossing, where most of them lived at present. Farther down the riverwas not so good for their hunting and fishing, but they would gowherever we said. That was the burden of the chief's speech.I took a liking to the old man at once. He was evidently a chief thatwas a chief. The chieftainship here was plainly not the effete anddecaying institution it is in many places on the Yukon. He spoke for allhis people without hesitation or question, and one felt that what hesaid was law amongst them.There followed for two days an almost continuous course of instructionin the elements of the Christian faith and Christian morals, all daylong and far into the night, with no more interval than cooking andeating required. In the largest tent of the encampment, packed full ofmen and women, the children wedged in where they could get, myselfseated on a pile of robes and skins, my interpreters at my side, myhearers squatted on the spruce boughs of the floor, the instruction wenton. As it proceeded, the interpretation improved, though it was stilldifficult and clumsy, as speaking through two minds and two mouths mustalways be. Whenever I stopped there was urgent request to go on, untilat last my voice was almost gone with incessant use. Over and over thesame things I went; the cardinal facts of religion--the Incarnation, theCrucifixion, the Resurrection, the Ascension; the cardinal laws ofmorality--the prohibition of murder, adultery, theft, and falsehood;that something definite might be left behind that should not be lost inthe vagueness of general recollection, and always with the insistencethat this was God's world and not the devil's world, a world in whichgood should ultimately prevail in spite of all opposition.[Sidenote: SAVAGE, HEATHEN, PAGAN]It is at once a high privilege and a solemn responsibility to deal withsouls to whom the appeal of the Christian religion had never before beenmade, as were most of my hearers. One cannot call them "heathen." Onenever thinks of these Alaskan natives as heathen. "Savage" and "heathen"and "pagan" all meant, of course, in their origin, just country people,and point to some old-time, tremendous superciliousness of thecity-bred, long since disappeared, except, perhaps, from such places asWhitechapel and the Bowery. A savage is simply a forest dweller, aheathen a heath dweller, and for a large part of each year I come,etymologically, within the terms myself. But with its ordinaryimplication of ferocity and bloodthirstiness it is absurd to apply theword "savage" to the mild and gentle Alaskan Indian, and, with itsordinary implication of bowing down to wood and stone, it is misleadingto apply the term "heathen" to those who never made any sort of gravenimage.Much has been written, and cleverly written, about the Alaskan Indianthat is preposterously untrue. Arthur, my half-breed boy, had recentlybeen reading a story by Jack London, dealing with the Indians in thevicinity of Tanana, where he was bred and born, and his indignation atthe representation of his people in this story was amusing. The storywas called _The Wit of Porportuk_, and it presented a native chief inalmost baronial state, with slaves waiting upon him in a largebanqueting hall and I know not what accumulated wealth of furs and gold.Such pictures are far more flagrantly untrue to any conditions that everexisted in Alaska than anything Fenimore Cooper wrote about the FiveNations. There were never any slaves in the interior; there was neverany wealth amongst the Indians; there was never any state andcircumstance of life. And the more one lives amongst them and knowsthem, the less one believes that they could ever have been a warlikepeople, despite their own traditions. Sporadic forays, fostered by theirignorant dread of one another or stirred up by rival medicine-men, theremay have been between different tribes--and there certainly were betweenthe Indians and the Esquimaux--with ambuscade and slaughter of isolatedhunting parties that ventured too far beyond the confines of their ownterritory; and one such affair would furnish tradition for generationsto dilate upon. I have myself found all the men of Nulato gone scouting,or hiding--I could not determine which--in the hills with their guns,upon a rumour that the "Huskies," or Esquimaux, were coming; I haveknown the Indians of the Yukon and the Tanana, and as far as theKoyukuk, excited and alarmed over the friendly visit of a handful ofragged natives from the Copper River to Nenana at Christmas time,although in either case it must certainly have been fifty years sincethere was any actual hostile incursion, and probably much longer.[Sidenote: A GENTLE, TIMID PEOPLE]They are a very timid people, and an exceedingly peaceable people. Yearsand years may be spent amongst them without knowledge of a single act ofviolence between Indian men; they do not quarrel and fight. Bold enoughin the chase, willing to face dangers of ice and water and wild beast,they have a dread of anything like personal encounter, and will submitto a surprising amount of imposition and overbearing on the part of awhite man without resorting to it. I knew a certain white man whoclaimed a whole river valley north of the Yukon as his, who warned offhunting parties of Indians who ventured upon it, and made them give upgame killed in "his territory." They came to the mission and complainedabout it, but they never withstood the usurper. It ought to be addedthat it always appeared more as the making good of a practical joke thanas a serious pretension, but the point is--the Indians submitted.So far as these natives of the interior are concerned they were neveridolaters. I cannot find that they had any distinct notion of worship atall. Their religion had root in a certain frantic terror of the unknown,and found expression in ceaseless efforts to propitiate the malignspirits surrounding them on every side. Thus they were given over to themastery of those amongst them who had the traditional art of suchpropitiation, and fell more or less completely under that cruellest andmost venal of sways, the tyranny of the witch-doctor. It is impossibleto doubt, and hard to exaggerate, the grinding and brutal exactions towhich this rule led. Anything that a man possessed might be demanded andmust be yielded, on pain of disease and death, even to the wholeseason's catch of fur or the deflowering of a young daughter. The utmostgreed and lust that can disgrace humanity found its Indian expression inthe lives of some of these medicine-men.Since every sort of tyranny has its vulnerable spot, since the despotismof Russia was tempered by assassination and of Japan by the effect ofpublic suicide, so melioration of the tyranny of the medicine-man seemsto have been found in rivalry amongst members of the craft itself.Oppressed beyond endurance by one practitioner, allegiance would betransferred to some new claimant of occult powers, and the breaking ofthe monopoly of magic would be followed by a temporary lightening of theburdens. Some of the most lurid of Alaskan legends deal with thethaumaturgic contests of rival medicine-men, and one judges that sleightof hand and even hypnotic suggestion were cultivated to a fine point.To such minds the Christian teaching comes with glad and one may sayinstantaneous acceptance. Their attitude is entirely childlike. They areanxious to be told more and more about it, to be told it over and overagain. There is never the slightest sign of incredulity. It does notoccur to them as possible that a man should be sent all this way tothem, should hunt them up and seek them out to tell it to them, unlessit were true. And one learns over again how universal is the appeal theChristian religion, and in particular the Life of Our Lord, makes tomankind. I have seen Indians and Esquimaux mixed, hearing for the firsttime the details of the Passion, stirred to as great indignation as wasthat barbarian chieftain who laid his hand on his sword and cried,"Would I and my men had been there!" or those Western cowboys, so thestory runs, bred in illiteracy and irreligion, to whose children aschool-teacher had given an account of the same great events, and whorode up to the schoolhouse the next day with guns and ropes, and asked:"Which way did them blamed Jews go?"The medicine-man lies low; may himself profess acceptance of the newteaching, may even really accept it (for it is very hard, indeed, tofollow and judge all the mental processes of an Indian)--yes, though itexpressly sweep all his devils away, out of the sick, out of the windand storm, from off every grave mound, though it leave him no paltrynet-tearing or trap-springing sprite to work upon with his conjurations;yet the old superstition dies hard, often crops up when one had thoughtit perished, and even sometimes maintains itself, sub rosa, side by sidewith definite, regular Christian worship.[Sidenote: THE OLD, OLD STORY]The arctic explorer Stefanson, a careful and acute observer who has hadexceptional opportunities for observation of the intimate life of theEsquimaux, has written much lately of the grafting of Christianity uponnative superstition and the existence of both together, as though itwere some new thing or newly noticed by himself. Yet every one familiarwith the history of Christianity knows that it has characterised theprogress of religion in all ages. There was never a people yet that didnot in great measure do this thing, nor is it reasonable to suppose thatit could have been otherwise. It is impossible to make a _tabula rasa_of men's minds. It is impossible to uproot customs of immemorialantiquity without leaving some rootlets behind. And what is acquiredjoins itself insensibly to what is retained, and either the incongruityis hidden beneath a change of nomenclature or is not hidden at all. Ourown social life is threaded through and through with customs andpractices which go back to a superstitious origin. The matter is such acommonplace of history that it is bootless to labour it here.A scientist is only a "scientist." How that name tends continually todepreciate itself as the pursuit of physical science is divorced moreand more completely from a knowledge of literature, from a knowledge ofthe humanities! And a scientist is a poor guide to an acquaintance withman, civilised or uncivilised. To come to the study of any race of man,even the most primitive, without some knowledge of all the long historyof man, of all the long history of man's thought, man's methods, man'sstrivings, man's accomplishments, man's failures, is to come so illequipped that no just conclusions are likely to be reached. Yourexclusive "scientist"--and such are most of them to-day--may becompetent to deal with circles and triangles, with wheels and leverswith cells and glands, with germs and bacilli and micro-organismsgenerally, with magnetos and dynamos, with all the heavenly host if youlike, but he has no equipment to deal with man! Somatic anthropology inparticular tends to assume in some quarters such an overimportance thatone falls back upon the recollection that the original head measurerswere hatters and that all hatters are proverbially mad. The occupationwould seem to carry the taint.It was with much pleasure that I was able to hold out hope to ChiefIsaac of the mission and the school he desired so earnestly for hispeople. It must not be supposed that all of them were in the completelyunevangelised state which has been dwelt upon, that to all of them theteaching of those two full days was novel; some of them, like the chiefhimself, had been across to the Yukon long ago and still bore some traceof the early labours of the Church of England missionaries to whom thisregion of Alaska that adjoins Canada is so much indebted. Others hadonce been to the Ketchumstock, upon the occasion of a visit from ourmissionary at Eagle, and had received instruction from him. But therewere many present in that tent who had never seen any missionary, neverhad any teaching, to whom it was wholly new save as they might havepicked up some inkling from those that had been more fortunate.[Illustration: THE TANANA CROSSING.][Illustration: GOOD GOING ON THE YUKON.][Sidenote: TRIBAL CONNECTIONS]When we left this encampment Isaac sent two of his young men to guideus, with a sled drawn by three or four small dogs, so gaily caparisonedwith _tapis_ and ribbons, tinsel, and pompons, that they might havebeen circus dogs. Here again is evidence of this tribe's affinitywith the upper Yukon natives, and so with those of the Mackenzie. Inever saw the _tapis_, a broad, bright ornamented cloth that lies uponthe dog's back under his harness, on the Middle Yukon. It ischaracteristic of the Peel River Indians who come across by the RampartHouse and La Pierre House.A few hours' journey brought us to the Tanana River again, which wecrossed, and took a portage on the other side that went up a long defileand then along a ridge and then down another long defile until at nightwe reached the native village at Lake Mansfield; a picturesque spot, forthe lake is entirely surrounded by mountains except on the side whichopens to the river. Here the Alaskan range and the Tanana River haveapproached so close that the water almost washes the base of thefoot-hills, and the scenery is as fine and bold as any in Alaska. Andhere, at Lake Mansfield, if only there were navigable connection betweenthe lake and the river into which it drains, would be an admirable placefor a mission station.A couple of hours next day took us the seven remaining miles to theTanana Crossing. Here, at that time, was a station of the militarytelegraph connecting Valdez on the coast with Fort Egbert (Eagle) on theYukon, a line maintained, at enormous expense, purely for militarypurposes. It passed through an almost entirely uninhabited country inwhich perhaps scarcely a dozen messages would originate in a year. Thetelegraph-line and Fort Egbert itself are now abandoned. Strategicconsiderations constitute a vague and variable quantity.It was strange to find this little station with two or three men of thesignal-corps away out here in the wilderness. Their post was supplied bymule pack-train from Fort Egbert, more than two hundred miles away, andthey told me that only ten pounds out of every hundred that left FortEgbert reached the Crossing, so self-limited is a pack-train throughsuch country. We amused ourselves calculating just how much farthermules and men could go until they ate up _all_ they could carry.The Tanana Crossing is a central spot for the Indians of this region.Two days' journey up the river was the village of the Tetlin Indians.Two days' journey into the mountain range were the Mantasta Indians. Twodays' journey across towards the Yukon were the Ketchumstock Indians.Most of them would congregate at this spot for certain parts of theyear, should we plant a mission there, and despite the picturesquesituation of Lake Mansfield, it looked as if the Crossing were the bestpoint for building.[Sidenote: THE TANANA CROSSING]Our route lay northeast, across country to Fortymile on the Yukon, twohundred and fifty miles away, along the trail for the greater part ofthe distance by which the mule train reached the Tanana Crossing. Thefirst five miles was all up-hill, a long, stiff, steady climb to thecrest of the mountain that rises just behind the Crossing. We had totake it slowly, with frequent stops, so steep was the grade, and everynow and then we got tantalising glimpses through the timber of the scenethat spread wider and wider below us. Bend after bend of the TananaRiver unfolded itself; the Alaskan range gave peak after peak; therelay Lake Mansfield, deep in its amphitheatre of hills, with the Indianvillage at its head.At last my impatience for the view that promised made me leave the boys(we still had Isaac's young men) and push on alone to the top. And itwas indeed by far the noblest view of the winter, one of the grandestand most extensive panoramas I had ever seen in my life.Perhaps three miles away, as the crow flies, from the river, andseventeen hundred and fifty feet above it, as the aneroid gave it, wewere already on the watershed, and everywhere in the direction we weretravelling the wide-flung draws and gullies of the Fortymile Riverstretched out, so clear and beautiful a display of the beginnings of agreat drainage system that my attention was arrested, notwithstanding myeagerness for the sight that awaited my turning around. But it was uponturning around and looking in the direction from which we had come thatthe grandeur and sublimity entered into the scene. There was, indeed, noone great dominating feature in this prospect as in the view of Denalifrom the Rampart portage, but the whole background, bounding the visioncompletely, was one vast wall of lofty white peaks, stretching without abreak for a hundred miles. Enormous cloud masses rose and fell aboutthis barrier, now unfolding to reveal dark chasms and glitteringglaciers, now enshrouding them again. In the middle distance the TananaRiver wound and twisted its firm white line amidst broken patches ofsnow and timber far away to either hand, and, where glacial affluentsdischarged into it, were finer, threadlike lines that marked the manymouths. The thick spruce mantling the slope in the foreground gave asombre contrast to the fields of snow, and the yellow March sunshine waspoured over all the wide landscape save where the great clouds contendedwith the great mountains.The boys had stopped to build a fire and brew some tea before leavingthe timber, and I was glad of it, for it gave me the chance to gaze myfill upon the inspiring and fascinating scene in the pleasant warmth ofthe mountain top, with the thermometer at 30° in the shade and just 12°higher in the sunshine.[Sidenote: A NOBLE VIEW]How grateful I was for the clear bright day! What a disappointment ithas been again and again to reach such an eminence and see--nothing! Itwas the most extensive view of the great Alaskan range I had eversecured--that long line of sharp peaks that stretches and broadens fromthe coast inland until it culminates in the highest point of the NorthAmerican continent and then curves its way back to the coast again. Ofcourse, what lay here within the vision was only a small part of one armof the range; it stopped far short of Denali on the one hand and MountSanford on the other, though it included Mount Kimball and Mount Hayes;yet it was the most impressive sight of a mountain chain I had everbeheld. It was a sight to be glad and grateful for, to put high amongstone's joyful remembrances; and with this notable sight we bade farewellto the Tanana valley.Down the hill we went into Fortymile water and into a rolling countrycrossed by the military mule trail. If the morning had been glorious theevening was full of penance. Long before night our feet were sore fromslipping and sliding into those wretched mule tracks. One cannot takeone's eyes from the trail for a moment, every footstep must be watched,and even then one is continually stumbling.We were able, however, to rig our team with the double hitch that is somuch more economical of power than the tandem hitch, whenever the widthof the trail permits it. We now carry a convertible rig, so that onnarrow trails or in deep snow we can string out the dogs one in front ofthe other, and when the trail is wide enough can hitch them side byside. "Seal," the Great Dane pup we got at the Salchaket, was a good andstrong puller, but he had no coat and no sense. It is bad enough to haveno coat in this country, but to have no coat and no sense is fatal--ashe found. His feet were continually sore and he had to be speciallyprovided for at night if it were at all cold--a dog utterly unsuited toAlaska.Thirty miles of such going as has been described is tiring in theextreme, and when we reached the Lone Cabin, behold! fifteen Indianscamped about it, for whom, when supper was done, followed two hours ofteaching and the baptism of six children. I would have liked to havestayed a day with them, but if we were to spend Palm Sunday at Fortymileand Easter at Eagle as had been promised, the time remaining did no morethan serve; and there was a large band of Indians to visit atKetchumstock.The next day took us into and across the Ketchumstock Flats, a widebasin surrounded by hills and drained by the Mosquito Fork of theFortymile. The telegraph-line, supported on tripods against the summeryielding of the marshy soil, cuts straight across country. This basinand the hills around form one of the greatest caribou countries,perhaps, in the world. All day we had passed fragments of the longfences that were in use in times past by the Indians for driving theanimals into convenient places for slaughter.The annual migration of the vast herd that roams the section of Alaskabetween the Yukon and the Tanana Rivers swarms over this Flat andthrough these hills, and we were told at the Ketchumstock telegraphstation by the signal-corps men that they estimated that upward of onehundred thousand animals crossed the Mosquito Fork the previous October.[Sidenote: CARIBOU]The big game of Alaska is not yet seriously diminished, though there wasneed for the legal protection that has of late years been given. It isprobable that more caribou and young moose are killed every year bywolves than by hunters. Only in the neighbourhood of a considerablesettlement is there danger of reckless and wasteful slaughter, and someattention is paid by game wardens to the markets of such places. Themountain-sheep stands in greater danger of extermination than eithercaribou or moose. Its meat, the most delicious mutton in the world, asit has been pronounced by epicures, brings a higher price than otherwild meat, and it is easy to destroy a band completely. The sheep on themountains of the Alaskan range nearest to Fairbanks have, it is said,been very greatly diminished, and that need not be wondered at when onesees sled load after sled load, aggregating several tons of meat,brought in at one shipment. The law protecting the sheep probably needstightening up.The big game is a great resource to all the people of the country, whiteand native. It is no small advantage to be able to take one's gun in thefall and go out in the valleys and kill a moose that will suffice forone man's meat almost the whole winter, or go into the hills and killfour or five caribou that will stock his larder equally well. The fresh,clean meat of the wilds has to most palates far finer flavour than anycold-storage meat that can be brought into the country; and, save at oneor two centres of population and distribution, cold-storage meat is notavailable at all. Without its big game Alaska would be virtuallyuninhabitable. Therefore most white men are content that the necessarymeasures be taken to prevent the wasteful slaughter of the game; for therights of the prospector and trapper and traveller, and the rights ofthe natives to kill at any time what is necessary for food, areexplicitly reserved.[Sidenote: THE KETCHUMSTOCK]We reached the village and telegraph post of Ketchumstock for the nightonly to find all the natives gone hunting; but since they had gone inthe direction of Chicken Creek, towards which we were travelling, wewere able to catch up with them the next morning without going far outof our way. While we were pitching our tent near their encampment cametwo or three natives with dog teams, and as the dogs hesitated to passour dogs, loose on the trail, a voluble string of curses in English fellfrom the Indian lips. Such is usually the first indication of contactwith white men, and in this case it spoke of the proximity of the miningon Chicken Creek. To discover the women chewing tobacco was to add butanother evidence of the sophistication of this tribe; a different peoplefrom Chief Isaac's tribe, different through many years' familiarity withthe whites at these diggings. If the mission to be built at the Crossingtends to keep these Indians on the Tanana River and thus away from thedemoralisation of the diggings, it will do them solid service.In some way foul and profane language falls even more offensively fromIndians than from whites; for the same reason, perhaps, that it soundsmore offensive and shocking from children than from adults. Sometimesthe Indian does not in the least understand the meaning of the words heuses; they are the first English words he ever heard and he hears themover and over again.So here another day and a half was spent in instruction. There are someforty souls in this tribe and they have had teaching from time to time,though not in the last few years, at the mouths of missionaries fromYukon posts. Most of the adults had been baptized; I baptized sixteenchildren. One curious feature of my stay was the megaphonicrecapitulation of the heads of the instruction, after each session, byan elderly Indian who stood out in the midst of the tents. What on earththis man, with his town-crier voice, was proclaiming at such length, wewere at a loss to conjecture, and upon inquiry were informed: "Themwomen, not much sense; one time tell 'em, quick forget; two time tell'em, maybe little remember." So when we stopped for dinner and forsupper and for bed, each time this brazen-lunged spieler stood forth andreiterated the main points of the discourse "for the _hareem_," asDoughty would say, whose account of the attitude of the Arabs to theirwomen often reminds me of the Alaskan Indians. It was interesting, but Ishould have preferred to edit the recapitulation.When all was done for the day and we thought to go to bed came an Indiannamed "Bum-Eyed-Bob" (these white man's nicknames, however dreadful, arealways accepted and used) for a long confabulation about the affairs ofthe tribe, and I gathered incidentally that gambling at the telegraphstation had been the main diversion of the winter. It seems ungraciousto insist so much upon the evil influence of the white men--we had beencordially received and entertained at that very place, and our moneyrefused--but there is little doubt that the abandonment of thetelegraph-line will be a good thing for these natives. Put two or threeyoung men of no special intellectual resource or ambition down in alonely spot like this, with no society at all save that of the nativesand practically nothing to do, and there is a natural and almostinevitable trend to evil. To the exceptional man with the desire ofpromotion, with books, and all this leisure, it would be an admirableopportunity, but he would be quite an exceptional man who should risealtogether superior to the temptations to idleness and debauchery. Onemay have true and deep sympathy with these young men and yet beconscious of the harm they often bring about.Ten miles or so from the encampment brought us to Chicken Creek, andfrom that point we took the Fortymile River. The direct trail to Eaglewith its exasperating mule tracks was now left, and our journey was onthe ice. But so warm was the weather that 16th of March that we werewet-foot all day, and within the space of eight hours that we weretravelling we had snow, sleet, rain, and sunshine. Leaving the mainriver, we turned up Walker Fork and, after a few miles, leaving that, weturned up Jack Wade Creek and pursued it far up towards its head ere wereached the road-house for the night.[Sidenote: THE FORTYMILE]We were now on historic ground, so far as gold mining in Alaska isconcerned. The "Fortymilers" bear the same pioneer relation to goldmining in the North that the "Fortyniners" bear to gold mining inCalifornia. Ever since 1886 placers have been worked in this district,and it still yields gold, though the output and the number of men arealike much reduced. It is interesting to talk with some of the originallocators of this camp, who may yet be found here and there in thecountry, and to learn of the conditions in those early days when asteamboat came up the Yukon once in a season bringing such supplies andmail as the men received for the year. It was here that the problem ofworking frozen ground was first confronted and solved; here that thefirst "miner's law" was promulgated, the first "miners' meeting" dealtout justice. Your "old-timer" anywhere is commonly _laudator temporisacti_, but there is good reason to believe that these early, andcertainly most adventurous, gold-miners, some of whom forced a way intothe country when there were no routes of travel, and subsisted on itsresources while they explored and prospected it, were men of a higherstamp than many who have come in since. The extent to which that earlyprospecting was carried is not generally known, for these men, after themanner of their kind, left no record behind them. There are few creekbeds that give any promise at all in the whole of this vast country thathave not had some holes sunk in them. Even in districts so remote as theKoyukuk, signs of old prospecting are encountered. When a stampede tookplace to the Red Mountain or Indian River country of the middle Koyukukin 1911-12, I was told that there was not a creek in the camp that didnot show signs of having been prospected long before, although it hadpassed altogether out of knowledge that this particular region had everbeen visited by prospectors.[Sidenote: "SNIPING ON THE BARS"]As the Fortymile is the oldest gold camp in the North, some of its trailmaking is of the best in Alaska. In particular the trail from the headof Jack Wade Creek down into Steel Creek reminded one of the Alpineroads in its bold, not to say daring, engineering. It drops from benchto bench in great sweeping curves always with a practicable grade, andmust descend nigh a thousand feet in a couple of miles. At the mouth ofSteel Creek we are on the Fortymile River again, having saved a day'sjourney by this traverse. And here, on the Fortymile, we passed severalmen "sniping on the bars," as the very first Alaskan gold-miners did onthis same river, and probably on these same bars, twenty-five years ago.One hand moved the "rocker" to and fro and the other poured water intoit with the "long Tom"; so was the gold washed out of the gravel takenfrom just below the ice. It was interesting to see this primitive methodstill in practice and to learn from the men that they were making"better than wages."The Fortymile is a very picturesque but most tortuous river. In oneplace, called appropriately "The Kink," I was able to clamber over aridge of rocks and reach another bend of the river in six or sevenminutes, and then had to wait twenty-five minutes for the dog team,going at a good clip, to come around to me. At length we reached thespot where a vista cut through the timber that clothes both banks,marked the 141st meridian, the international boundary, and passed out ofAlaska into British territory. A few miles more brought us to MooseCreek, where a little Canadian custom-house is situated, and there wespent the night.The next day we reached the Yukon; passing gold dredges laid up for thewinter and other signs of still-persisting mining activity, goingthrough the narrow wild cañon of the Fortymile, and so to the littletown at its mouth of the same name, where there is a mission of theChurch of England and a post of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police. Inever come into contact with this admirable body of men without wishingthat we had a similar body charged with the enforcement of the law inAlaska.Sunday was spent there officiating for the layman in charge of themission and in interesting talk with the sergeant of police about theannual winter journey from Dawson to Fort McPherson on the McKenzie,from which he had just returned with a detail of men. The next winter heand his detail lost their way and starved and froze to death on the samejourney.Here at one time was a flourishing Indian mission and school, and hereBishop Bompas, the true "Apostle of the North," lived for some time. Thestory of this man's forty-five years' single-eyed devotion to theIndians of the Yukon and McKenzie Rivers is one of the brave chapters ofmissionary history. But the Church of England "does not advertise."Writers about Alaska, even writers about Alaskan missions, carefullycollect all the data of the early Russian missions on the coast, butignore altogether the equally influential and lasting work done alongfive hundred miles of what is now the American Yukon by the missionaryclergy of the English Church before and after the Purchase. BishopBompas identified himself so closely with the natives as to becomealmost one of them in the eyes of the white men, and many curiousstories linger amongst the old-timers as to his habits and appearance.It is interesting to know that the bishop was a son of that SergeantBompas of the English bar from whom Dickens drew the character ofSergeant Buzfuz, counsel for the plaintiff in the famous suit of"Bardell v. Pickwick."But the natives have all left Fortymile, some to the large village ofMoosehide just below Dawson, some to Eagle. The town, too, like all theupper Yukon towns, is much decayed; the custom-house, the policebarracks, the company's store, the road-house, and the little missionembracing nearly all its activities and housing nearly all itspopulation.There is always some feeling of satisfaction in reaching the broadhighway of the Yukon again, even though rough ice make bad going and oneof the most notorious, dirty road-houses in the North hold its menaceover one all day and amply fulfil it at night. There is indeed so littletravel on the river now that it does not pay any one to keep aroad-house save as incidental to a steamboat wood camp and summerfishing station. Two short days' travel brought us across theinternational boundary again to Eagle in Alaska, where at that time FortEgbert was garrisoned with two companies of soldiers.[Sidenote: EAGLE]Eagle and Fort Egbert together, for the one begins where the other ends,have perhaps the finest and most commanding situation of any settlementon the Yukon River. The mountains rise with dignity just across thewater and break pleasingly into the valley of Eagle Creek, a few milesup-stream. To the rear of the town an inconsiderable flat does but givespace and setting before the mountains rise again; while just below themilitary post stands the bold and lofty bluff called the Eagle Rock,with Mission Creek winding into the Yukon at its foot. Robert LouisStevenson said that Edinburgh has the finest situation of any capitalin Europe and pays for it by having the worst climate of any city in theworld. It would not be just to paraphrase this description with regardto Eagle, for while it is unsurpassed on the Yukon for site, there arespots on that river where still more disagreeable weather prevails; yetit cannot be denied that the position of the place subjects it toexceedingly bitter winds, or that the valley of Eagle Creek, which givespleasing variety to the prospect, acts also as a channel to convey thefull force of the blast. Climate everywhere is a very local thing;topographical considerations often altogether outweigh geographical; andnowhere is this truer than in Alaska. Commanding sites are necessarilyexposed sites, and he who would dwell in comfort must build inseclusion.A native village of eighty or ninety souls, with its church and school,lies three miles up-stream from the town, so that the relative positionsof village, town, and military post exactly duplicate those at Tanana.It must at once be stated, however, that this situation has not led toanything like the demoralisation amongst the natives at Eagle thatthrusts itself into notice at the other place. Whether it were thelonger training in Christian morals that lay behind these people, orbetter hap in the matter of post commanders (certainly there was neversuch scandalous irregularity and indifference at Egbert as marked oneadministration at Gibbon), or the vigilance during a number ofconsecutive years of an especially active deputy marshal and the wisdomand concern through an even longer period of a commissioner much abovethe common stamp,[F] or all these causes combined, the natives at Eaglehave not suffered from the proximity of soldiers and civilians in thesame measure as the natives at Tanana. Drunkenness and debauchery therehave been again and again, but they have been severely checked andrestrained by both the civil and military authorities.It was pleasant during Holy Week and Easter to see so many of theenlisted men of the garrison taking part in the services in town;pleasant, especially, to see officers and men singing together in thechoir, a tribute to the tact and zeal of the earnest layman in charge ofthis mission; and it was pleasant at the village to hear the nativeliturgy again and to see old men and women following the lessons in thenative Bible.[Sidenote: FORT EGBERT ABANDONED]Fort Egbert is abandoned now, another addition to the melancholy of theYukon; its extensive buildings, barracks, and officers' quarters,post-exchange and commissariat, hospital, sawmill, and artisans' shops,a spacious, complete gymnasium only recently built, are all vacant anddeserted. In the yards lie three thousand cords of dry wood, a year'ssupply; cut on the hills, awaiting the expected annual contracts, lie asmany more--six thousand cords of wood left to rot! Some of us perverse"conservationists," upon whom the unanimous Alaskan press delights topour scorn, lament the trees more than the troops.One may write thus and yet have many pleasant personal associationswith the post and those who have lived there. A large and variedmilitary acquaintanceship is acquired by regular visits to these Alaskanforts, for the whole command changes every two years. If one stayed inthe country long enough one would get to know the whole United Statesarmy, as regiment after regiment spent its brief term of "foreignservice" in the North. Gazing upon the empty quarters, the occasion ofmy first visit came back vividly, when there was diphtheria amongst thenatives at Circle and none to cope with it save the missionary nurse.The civil codes containing no provision for quarantine, the UnitedStates commissioner at Circle could not help, and the Indians grewrestive and rebellious, and when Christmas came broke through therestrictions completely. Even some of the whites of the place defied herprohibition and attended native dances and encouraged the Indians intheir self-willed folly.[Sidenote: SOME ARMY OFFICERS]So I went up the week's journey to Eagle and sought assistance fromMajor Plummer, the officer commanding the post, who, after telegraphingto Washington, promptly despatched a hospital steward and a couple ofsoldiers, and placed them entirely at the nurse's disposal. "I don'tthink we have any law for it," he said, "but we'll bluff it out." Andbluff it out they did very effectively until the disease was stampedout, and then they thoroughly disinfected and whitewashed every cabinthat had been occupied by the sick. I used to tell that nurse that, sofar as I knew, she was the only woman who had ever had command of UnitedStates soldiers.Then there was Captain Langdon of the same regiment, the scholarlysoldier, with the account of every great campaign in history at hisfingers' ends. I recollect one evening, when we had been talking of thePeninsular War, I ventured to spring on him the ancient schoolboyconundrum: "What lines are those, the most famous ever made by anEnglishman, yet that are never quoted?" "Lines?" said he, "lines?"though I don't think he had ever heard the jest. "They must be the Linesof Torres Vedras." How well I remember the musical box that used toarouse me at seven in the morning, however late we had sat talking thenight before!And that young lieutenant, of wealthy New York people, just arrived fromWest Point, who was sent by another commandant to report upon thecondition of the natives at the village and who came back and reportedthe whole population in utter destitution and recommended the issue offree rations to them all! As a matter of fact, during the administrationof this commanding officer, some sixteen or eighteen persons were putupon the list for gratuitous grub, and it took a written protest to getthem off. For no one who has the welfare of the natives at heart cantolerate the notion of making them paupers; these who have always fendedabundantly for themselves, and can entirely do so yet. With free rationsthere would be no more hunting, no more trapping, no more fishing; and ahardy, self-supporting race would sink at once to sloth and beggary andforget all that made men of them. If it were designed to destroy theIndian at a blow, here is an easy way to do it. Yet there are some,obsessed with the craze about what is called education, regarding it asan end in itself and not as a means to any end, who recommend thispauperising because it would permit the execution of a compulsoryschool-attendance law. Or is it a personal delusion of mine that esteemsan honest, industrious, self-supporting Indian who cannot read and writeEnglish above one who can read and write English--and can do nothingelse--and so separates me from many who are working amongst the natives?These days at the end of March, when the sun shines more than twelvehours in the twenty-four, are too long for the ordinary winter day'stwenty-five miles or so, and yet not quite long enough, even if man anddogs could stand it, to double the stage; so that there is much daylightleisure at road-houses. One grows anxious, after four months on thetrail, to be done with it; to draw as quickly as may be to one's"thawing-out" place. One even becomes a little impatient of thecontinual dog talk and mining talk of the road-houses, to which one haslistened all the winter. On the other hand, the travelling is verypleasant and the going usually very good, so that one may often ride onthe sled for long stretches.By river and portage--one portage that comes so finely down to the Yukonfrom a bench that there is pleasure in anticipating the view itaffords--in two days we reached the Nation road-house, just below themouth of the Nation River, a name that has always puzzled me. Here allnight long the wolves howling around the carcass of a horse kept ourdogs awake, and the whimpering of the dogs kept us awake. The countrybeyond the Yukon to the northeast, the large area included between theYukon and the Porcupine, into which the Nation River offers passage, isone of the wildest and least known portions of Alaska, abounding in gameand beasts of prey.[Sidenote: THE GLARE OF THE SUN]At the Charley River we visited the native village and held service andinstruction as well as inadequate interpretation permitted. Round CoalCreek and Woodchopper Creek the scenery becomes bold and attractive, butwe found, as usual, that as we pushed farther and farther down the riverthe snow was deeper and the going not so good. The sun grows very brightupon the snow these days of late March and early April. Even throughheavily tinted glasses it inflames the eyes more or less, and a coupleof hours without protection would bring snow-blindness. Bright days atthis season are the only days in all the year when the camera shuttermay be used at its full speed. When the sun comes out after a flurry ofnew snow in April, the light is many times greater than in midsummer.[Illustration: "A PORTAGE THAT COMES SO FINELY DOWN TO THE YUKON THATTHERE IS PLEASURE IN ANTICIPATING THE VIEW IT AFFORDS."][Illustration: FORT YUKON.]We reached Circle in a day and a half from Woodchopper Creek, in time tospend Sunday there. Circle had not changed much in the five years thathad elapsed since the first visit to it mentioned in these pages. Theslender trellis of the wireless telegraph had added a prominent featureto its river bank; a few more empty cabins had been torn down forfire-wood. Here it was necessary to shoot the Great Dane pup we got atthe Salchaket. His feet were still very sore and he quite useless forthe next winter, while Doc was returned to me from Fairbanks, notmuch the worse for his severe frost-bite. Indian after Indian begged forthe dog, but I had more regard for him than to turn him over to thetender mercies of an Indian. There are exceptional Indians, but for mypart I would rather be a dead dog than an ordinary Indian's dog--so hedied.There remained the seventy-five or eighty miles through the Yukon Flatsto Fort Yukon--always the most dangerous stretch of the river, and atthis season, when the winter's trail was beginning to break up,particularly so. It would be entirely practicable to cut a land trailthat should not touch the river at all, or not at more than one point,between Circle and Fort Yukon, and such a portage besides removing allthe danger would save perhaps twenty miles. In many places it wasnecessary for one of us to go ahead with an axe, constantly sounding andtesting the ice. Here and there we made a circuit around open water intowhich the ice that bore the trail had collapsed bodily--one of them aparticularly ugly place, with black water twenty feet deep running atsix or seven miles an hour. I never pass this stretch of river without afeeling of gratitude that I am safely over it once more.[Sidenote: CAPTAIN AMUNDSEN]As we left the Halfway Island we passed an Indian from Fort Yukon goingup the river with dogs and toboggan, and I chuckled, as I returned hisvery polite salutation and shook hands with him, at the success of theway he had been dealt with the previous fall, for he had been aparticularly churlish fellow with an insolent manner. Six or sevenyears before he had been taken by Captain Amundsen, of the _Gjoa_, asguide along this stretch of the river. It will be remembered that whenthat skilful and fortunate navigator had reached Herschell Island fromthe east, he left his ship in winter quarters and made a rapid journeywith Esquimaux across country to Fort Yukon expecting to find atelegraph station there from which he could send word of his success.But to his disappointment he found it necessary to go two hundred andthirty miles farther up the river to Eagle, before he could despatch hismessage. So he left his Esquimaux at Fort Yukon and took this Indian asguide. And in his modest and most interesting book he mentions the man'ssurliness and says he was glad to get rid of him at Circle.Some new outbreak of insolence for which he had been flung out of astore decided that he must be dealt with, and I sent for him, for thechief, the native minister, and the interpreter. With these assessorsbeside me, and Captain Amundsen's book open on the table, I spoke to theman of his general conduct and reputation. I read the derogatory remarkabout him in the book "printed for all the world to read," and told himthat of all the people, white and native, the captain had met on hisjourneys, only one was spoken of harshly and he was the one. It made agreat impression on the man. The chief and the native minister followedit up with their harangues, and the net result was a thorough change inhis whole attitude and demeanour. He told us he felt the shame of beingheld up to the world as rude and impudent and would try to amend. He hastried so successfully that he is now one of the politest and mostcourteous Indians in the village, for which, if this should ever chanceto reach Captain Amundsen's eye, I trust he will accept our thanks.Fort Yukon, where the headquarters of the archdeaconry of the Yukon arenow fixed, grows in native population and importance. A new and sightlychurch, a new schoolhouse, a new two-story mission house, a medicalmissionary and a nurse in residence, as well as a native clergyman, markthe Indian metropolis of this region and perhaps of all interior Alaska.Self-government is fostered amongst the people by a village councilelected annually, that settles native troubles and disputes and takescharge of movements for the general good, and of the relief of nativepoverty. The resident physician has been appointed justice of the peaceand there is effort to enforce the law of the land at a place whereevery man has been a law unto himself. But it is a very slow anddifficult matter to enforce law in this country at all, and moreparticularly at these remote points; and the class of white men who areto be found around native villages, many of whom "fear not God neitherregard man," pursue their debauchery and deviltry long time unwhipped.FOOTNOTE:[F] I take pleasure in naming Mr. U. G. Myers as the United Statescommissioner in question and Mr. Jack Robinson as the deputy UnitedStates marshal, and I mention their names the more readily because Mr.Myers, after his long and excellent service, has just been removed forpolitical reasons. (May, 1916.)CHAPTER XFROM THE TANANA RIVER TO THE KUSKOKWIM--THENCE TO THE IDITAROD MININGCAMP--THENCE TO THE YUKON, AND UP THAT RIVER TO FORT YUKONTHE discovery of gold on the Innoko in the winter of 1906-7, and the"strike" on the Iditarod, a tributary of the Innoko, some three yearslater, opened up a new region of Alaska. It is characteristic of a golddiscovery in a new district that it sets men feverishly to workprospecting all the adjacent country, and sends them as far afield fromit as the new base of supplies will allow them to stretch their tether.A glance at the map will show that the Innoko and Iditarod country liesbetween the two great rivers of Alaska, the Yukon and the Kuskokwim,much lower down the Yukon than any of the earlier gold discoveries; thatis to say that while the Tanana gold fields lie off the Middle Yukon,the Circle fields off the upper Yukon, the Iditarod camp belongs to thelower river. The Innoko workings were not extensive nor very rich, butthey furnished a base for prospecting from which the Iditarod wasreached, and Flat Creek, in the latter district, promised to bewonderfully rich. Immediately upon the news of this strike reaching theother camps of the interior, preparations were made far and wide formigrating thither upon the opening of Yukon navigation, and the earlysummer of 1910 saw a wild stampede to the Iditarod. Saloon-keepers,store-keepers, traders of all kinds, and the rag-tag and bobtail thatalways flock to a new camp were on the move so soon as the ice went out.From Dawson, from the Fortymile, from Circle, from Fairbanks, from theKoyukuk, and as soon as Bering Sea permitted, from Nome, all sorts ofcraft bore all sorts of people to the new Eldorado, while the firstthrough steamboats from the outside were crowded with people from thePacific coast eager to share in the opportunity of wealth. Thesensational magazines had been printing article after article about "Theincalculable riches of Alaska," and here were people hoping to pick someof it up. Iditarod City sprang into life as the largest "city" of theinterior; the centre of gravity of the population of the interior ofAlaska was shifted a thousand miles in a month.Iditarod City furnished a new and large base of supplies. Amidst theheterogeneous mass of humanity that swarmed into the place, though by nomeans the largest element in it, were experienced prospectors from everyother district in Alaska. Under the iniquitous law that then prevailedand has only recently been modified, by which there was no limit at allto the number of claims in a district which one man could stake forhimself and others, every creek adjacent to Flat Creek, every creek formany miles in every direction, had long since been tied up by the menwith lead-pencils and hatchets. So the newly arrived prospectors mustspread out yet wider, and they were soon scattered over all the ruggedhundred miles between Iditarod City and the Kuskokwim River. Here andthere they found prospects; and here and there what promised to be"pay." They started a new town, Georgetown, on the Kuskokwim itself;another town sprang up on the Takotna, a tributary of the Kuskokwim; andthe great Commercial Company of Alaska, ever alert for new developments,put a steamboat on the Kuskokwim and built trading-posts at both thesepoints. Thus the Kuskokwim country, which for long had been one of theleast-known portions of Alaska, was opened up almost at a stroke.[Sidenote: CAMP AT 50° BELOW]It was my purpose to visit Iditarod City during the winter of 1910-11,although, by reason of the distance to be travelled, a journey thitherwould involve the omission of the customary winter visit to upper Yukonpoints. When the northern trip to the Koyukuk was returned from atTanana, a sad journey had to be made to Nenana to bury the body of MissFarthing, and Doctor Loomis, missionary physician at Tanana, whoaccompanied me on this errand, had almost as rough a breaking-in to theAlaska trail as we came back to Tanana again as Doctor Burke had in ourjourney over the "first ice" of the Koyukuk two years before. Two feetof new snow lay on the trail, and the thermometer went down to 60° belowzero. We were camped once on the mail trail, unable to reach aroad-house, at 50° below zero.[Illustration: THE ROUGH BREAKING IN OF DOCTOR LOOMIS, CAMPED ON THEMAIL TRAIL AT 50° BELOW ZERO, UNABLE TO REACH A ROAD-HOUSE FOR THE DEEPSNOW.][Illustration: ESQUIMAUX OF THE UPPER KUSKOKWIM.][Sidenote: THE ROUTE TO THE IDITAROD]From Tanana the beaten track to the Iditarod lay one hundred and sixtymiles down the Yukon to Lewis's Landing, and then across country by theLewis Cut-Off one hundred miles to Dishkaket on the Innoko, andthence across country another hundred miles to Iditarod City. But Idesigned to penetrate to the Iditarod by another route. I had longdesired to visit Lake Minchúmina and its little band of Indians, and topass through the upper Kuskokwim country. So I had engaged a MinchúminaIndian as a guide, and laid my course up the Tanana River to theCoschaket, and then due south across country to Lake Minchúmina and theupper Kuskokwim.The Cosna is a small stream confluent with the Tanana, about thirtymiles above the mouth of that river, and we had hoped to reach it by theriver trail upon the same day we left the mission at Tanana, the 18th ofFebruary, 1911. But the trail was too heavy and the going too slow andthe start too late. When we had reached Fish Creek, about half-way, itwas already growing dark, and we were glad to stop in a native cabin,where was an old widow woman with a blind daughter. The daughter,unmarried, had a little baby, and I inquired through Walter who thefather was and whether the girl had willingly received the man or if hehad taken advantage of her blindness. She named an unmarried Indian,known to me, and declared that she had not been consenting. It seemed apaltry and contemptible trick to take advantage of a fatherless blindgirl. I baptized the baby and resolved to make the man marry the girl.The next night we reached the Coschaket, which, following the Indianrule, means "mouth of the Cosna," and found that our guide, MinchúminaJohn, had already relayed a load of grub that Walter had previouslybrought here from Tanana, one day's march upon our journey. Our coursefrom the Coschaket left the Tanana River and struck across country by anold Indian trail that had not been used that winter. Through scrubbyspruce and over frozen lakes and swamps, crossing the Cosna severaltimes--a narrow little river with high steep banks--the trail went,until it brought us to a hunting camp of the Indians, about eighteenmiles from the Coschaket. Here our stuff was cached and here we spentthe night, doctoring the sick amongst them as well as we could. My eyeshad been sorely tried this day despite dark smoked glasses, for we weretravelling almost due south, and the sun was now some hours in the skyand yet low enough to shine right in one's face. So Walter stopped at abirch-tree, stripped some of the bark, and made an eye-shade that was agreat comfort and relief.From this place began the slow work of double-tripping. The unbrokensnow was too deep to permit the hauling of our increased load over itwithout a preliminary breaking out of a trail on snow-shoes. So camp wasleft standing and Walter and John went ahead all day and returned lateat night with eight or nine miles of trail broken, while I stayed incamp and had dog feed cooked and supper ready. The next day we advancedthe camp so far as the trail was broken. A moose had used the trail forsome distance, however, since the boys left it, and his great plunginghoofs had torn up the snow worse than a horse would have done.A driving wind and heavy snowfall had drifted the new trail in the nightso badly, moreover, that we were not able to cover the full stretchthat had been snow-shoed, but camped in the dusk after we had gone eightmiles. Eight miles in two days was certainly very poor travel, and atthis rate our supplies would never take us down to the forks of theKuskokwim. Yet there was no other way in which we could proceed. Theweather was exceedingly mild, too mild for comfort--the thermometerranging from 20° to 25° above--and the dogs felt the unseasonablewarmth. It took us all that week to make the watershed between thedrainage of the Tanana and the drainage of the Kuskokwim, a point abouthalf-way to Lake Minchúmina. One day trail was broken, the next day theloads went forward. Tie the dogs as securely as one would, it was notsafe to go off and leave our supplies exposed to the ravages that abroken chain or a slipped collar might bring, so two went forward and Isat down in camp. The boys on their return usually brought with them afew brace of ptarmigan or grouse or spruce hen or, at the least, arabbit or so.[Sidenote: THE CAMP-ROBBERS]The camp-robbers, to my mind the most interesting of Alaskan birds,became very friendly and tame on these vigils. They stay in the countryall the winter, when most birds have migrated, like prosperous mineowners, to less rigorous climates; they turn up everywhere, in the mostmysterious way, so soon as one begins to make any preparation forcamping, and they are bold and fearless and take all sorts of chances.On this journey more than once they alighted on a moving sled and peckedat the dried fish that happened to be exposed. Yet they are so alert andso quick in their movements that it would be difficult to catch themwere they actually under one's hand. One of them, during a long day incamp, grew so tame that it pecked crumbs off the toe of my moccasin, andin another day or two would, one feels sure, have eaten out of the hand.There is a curious belief, strongly intrenched in the Alaskan mind, thatthe nest of this most common bird has never been found, and that theSmithsonian Institution has a standing offer of a large sum of money forthe discovery. They build in the spruce-trees, ten or twelve feet abovethe ground, a nest of rough twigs, and lay five very small eggs, greyspotted with black. This, at any rate, is the description that Waltergives me of a nest he discovered with the bird sitting upon it, and Ihave found the boy's accounts of such matters entirely trustworthy. Itis curious, however, that the nest of a bird so common all over Alaskaas the camp-robber should be so rarely found. At times they are verymischievous and destructive, and the man who builds a careless cachewill often be heard denouncing them, but to my mind a bird who gives ushis enlivening company throughout the dead of an Alaskan winter deserveswhat pickings he can get.[Sidenote: SOFT WEATHER]On Saturday, the 25th of February, after climbing a rather stiff hill,we passed temporarily out of Yukon into Kuskokwim waters, for thetributaries of these two great drainage systems interlock in thesehills. At the foot of the hill we stopped for lunch, a roaring fire wassoon built, and a great cube of beaten snow impaled upon a stake was setup before the fire to drip into a pan for tea water, while the boysroasted rabbits. In a few hours more we were on the banks of one of thetributaries of the East Fork (properly the North Fork) of the Kuskokwim.Here, in an unoccupied native cabin, we made our camp and lay overSunday, and here began the most remarkable spell of weather I have knownin the interior at this season of the year. The thermometer rose to 37°and then to 40°; the snow everywhere was thawing, and presently it beganto rain steadily. It was the first time I had seen a decided thaw inFebruary, let alone rain.Next day the rain turned to snow, but since the thermometer still stoodaround 40°, the snow melted as it fell, and we were wet through all day.The snow underfoot, however, was so much less and so much harder that wewere able to proceed without preliminary trail breaking. But it was amost disagreeable day and the prelude to a more disagreeable night.Soft, wet snow clings to everything it touches. The dogs are sooncarrying an additional burden; balls of snow form on all projectingtufts of hair; masses of snow must continually be beaten off the sled.Every time a snow-shoe is lifted from the ground it lifts a few poundsof snow with it. One's moccasins and socks are soon wet through, and thefeet, encased in this sodden cold covering, grow numb and stay so. Wecrossed a considerable mountain pass in driving snow, and should neverhave found the way without John, for much of it was above timber, andwhen it took us through woods the blazes on the trees were so bleachedwith age as to be difficult of recognition. The Indians have used thistrail for generations; but few white men have ever passed along it.Wet snow, wet spruce boughs, wet tent, wet wood, wet clothing make poorcamping. Water-proof equipment is so rarely needed on the winter trailthat one does not bother with it. But the climate of the Kuskokwimvalley is evidently different from that of the rest of the interior, if,as John said, such weather is not remarkable in these parts at thisseason. A third day was of much the same description; thawing andheavily snowing all day, the thermometer between 36° and 40°. The labourof going ahead of the teams and breaking trail, on the snow-shoes,through slush, grew so great that I relinquished it to John and took thehandle-bars of his sled. We were approaching Lake Minchúmina, but thehills that led us into Yukon waters once more and should have given usviews of the lake and the great mountains beyond gave nothing. It is akeen disappointment to be utterly denied great views, the expectation ofwhich has been a support through long distances and fatigues.At noon we built a fire with considerable difficulty, but once it wasstarted we plied it with fuel till we had a noble, roaring bonfire, andwe hung our wet socks and moccasins and parkees and caps and mittsaround it and stayed there until they were dry, though the resumption ofour journey in the continuous melting snow soon wet everything throughagain.[Sidenote: LAKE MINCHÚMINA]At length, late in the evening of the 28th of February, we descended along ridge and came upon the northeastern shore of Lake Minchúmina, oneof the most considerable lakes of interior Alaska. It stretched itsbroad expanse away into the misty distance, the farther shore quiteinvisible, the snow driving slowly over it, and it looked as though wehad stumbled by mistake upon the shores of the Arctic Ocean. There wasno sort of trail upon it and the snow-shoes sank through the meltingsnow of its surface into the water that lay upon the ice and brought upa load of slush at every step; yet the going would have been still worsewithout them. The recollection of the six miles we trudged across thatlake is a dismal recollection of utter fatigue, of mechanical liftingand falling of encumbered feet with the recurring feeling that it wouldbe impossible to lift them any more. All across that lake I ate snow,and that and the back-ache legacy of an old strain are my signs ofapproaching exhaustion. Four hours passed ere we heard the noise of dogsand saw the glimmer of a light through the darkness, and the hearts ofmen and beasts alike leaped to the expectation of rest and shelter. Wehad feared the village might be deserted and were rejoiced that theIndians were still there.Never was hospitality more grateful than that we had from the littleremote band of natives at the Minchúmina village. They made a pot of teaand fried some flap-jacks for us, and that was our supper, though Ithink the boys ate some boiled moose meat from a pot on the stove. Wehad plenty of grub, but were too weary to cook it; we spread our beddingdown on the floor amongst a dozen others and fell almost at once into adeep sleep. Almost at once; for the arrival of our eight dogs had made acommotion amongst the canine population of the place, that afterrepeated outbreaks of noisy animosity and defiance seemed to turn bycommon consent into a friendly and most protracted howling contest inwhich my malamute "Muk" plainly outdid all competitors. How much longerthe noise would have kept up it is hard to say--dogs never seem tootired to howl--but when the limit of Indian patience was reached, anaged crone rolled out of the bed into which she had rolled "allstanding," seized a staff and went outdoors to lay it impartially uponthe backs of all the disturbers of the peace, domestic and foreign, witha screech that was as formidable as the blows. The rest was silence.The next morning a dozen alarm-clocks went off within a few minutes ofeach other. Every adult in that cabin owned a separate alarm-clock, androse, one supposes, to the summons of no other timepiece. At any rate,the clocks went off at intervals, and the natives arose one by one andseemed hugely to enjoy the clatter. Let one purchase a new thing andevery individual in the community must have one also.But what struck me instantly upon arising was the miraculoustransformation that had taken place outdoors. The sun was shiningbrilliantly through a clear sky! I hastened to dress and, not waitingfor breakfast, seized my camera and started out. The chinook was over;the sharp, welcome tang of frost was in the air; the snow was hardunderfoot. Out upon the gleaming surface of the lake I went for nigh amile, resolutely refusing to look behind. I knew what vision awaited mewhen I turned around, had, indeed, caught a slight glimpse as I left thecabin, and I wanted the smooth, open foreground of the lake that Imight see it to the best advantage.[Sidenote: DENALI AND HIS WIFE]There is probably no other view of North America's greatest mountaingroup comparable to that from Lake Minchúmina. From almost every othercoign of vantage in the interior I had seen it and found it more or lessunsatisfying. Only from distant points like the Pedro Dome or the summitbetween Rampart and Glen Gulch does the whole mass and uplift of it comeinto view with dignity and impressiveness. At close range the peaks seemstunted and inconspicuous, their rounded, retreating slopes lackingstrong lines and decided character. But from the lake the precipitouswestern face of Denali and Denali's Wife rise sheer, revealed by thelevel foreground of the snow from base to summit. It was, indeed, aglorious scene. There stood the master peak, seeming a stupendousvertical wall of rock rising twenty thousand feet to a splendid sharpcrest perhaps some forty or fifty miles away; there, a little farther tothe south, rose the companion mass, a smaller but still enormouselevation of equally savage inaccessibility; while between them, nearthe base, little sharp peaks stretched like a corridor of ruined archesfrom mass to mass. One was struck at once by the simple appropriatenessof the native names for these mountains. The master peak is Denali--thegreat one; the lesser peak is Denali's Wife; and the little peaksbetween are the children. And my indignation kindled at the substitutionof modern names for these ancient mountain names bestowed immemoriallyby the original inhabitants of the land! Is it too late to strike MountMcKinley and Mount Foraker from the map? The names were given fifteen orsixteen years ago only, by one who saw them no nearer than a hundredmiles. Is it too late to restore the native names contemptuouslydisplaced?The majesty of the scene grew upon me as I gazed, and presently handwent to camera that some record of it might be attempted. But alas forthe limitations of photography! I knew, even as I made the exposures,first at one one-hundredth of a second and then at one-fiftieth, thatthere was little hope of securing a picture; the air was yet faintlyhazy with thin vapour; the early sun made too acute an angle with thepeaks; and the yellow lens screen was left in the hind-sack of the sled.It was even as I feared. When developed some months later, the film heldabsolutely no trace of the mighty mountains that had risen so proudlybefore it. I promised myself that at noon, when the sun had removed to agreater distance from the mountains and made a more favourable anglewith them, I would return and try again; but by noon had come anothersudden, violent change of the weather, and snow was falling once more.[Sidenote: THE MINCHÚMINA FOLK]So I got no picture, save the picture indelibly impressed upon mymemory, of the noblest mountain scene I had ever gazed upon which madememorable this 1st of March; perhaps one of the noblest mountain scenesin the whole world, for one does not recall another so great uplift fromso low a base. The marshy, flat country that stretches from Minchúminato the mountains cannot be much more than one thousand feet above thesea. Those awful precipices dropping thousands of feet at a leap, thosepeaks rising serene and everlasting into the highest heaven, theoverwhelming size and strength and solidity of their rocky bulk, allthis sank into my heart, and there sprang up once again the passionatedesire of exploring the bowels of them, of creeping along their glaciersand up their icy ridges, of penetrating their hidden chambers, inviolatesince the foundation of the world, and maybe scaling their ultimatesummits and looking down upon all the earth even as they look down!Men, however, and not mountains, made the immediate demand upon one'sinterest and attention, and I returned to breakfast and the duties ofthe day. The Minchúmina people are a very feeble folk, some sixteen alltold at the time of our visit, greatly reduced by the epidemics of thelast decade, living remote from all others on the verge of their race'shabitat. They trade chiefly at Tanana, a hundred and thirty miles or soaway, walking an annual trip thither with their furs, and owning anominal allegiance to our mission at that place. It was the first timethat any clergyman had ever visited them, and the whole of the day wasspent with them, discovering what they knew and trying to teach them alittle more. The people sat around on the floor and hung upon the lipsof the interpreter. But what a barrier a difference of language is! Aninterpreter is like a mountain pass, a means of access but at the costof time and labour. He does not remove the obstruction. The Minchúminapeople occupy a fine country that could amply support ten times theIndian population that now inhabits it. We were, indeed, now entering acountry that has been almost depopulated by successive epidemics ofcontagious diseases. The measles in 1900 slew most of them, anddiphtheria in 1906 destroyed all the children and many of the adultsthat remained. The chief of this little band wore a hat proudly adornedwith ribbons and plumes, and flew a flag before his dwelling with theinitials of the North American Trading and Transportation Company onit--a defunct Alaskan corporation. We could not learn the originthereof; the flag and the letters were plainly home-made. It wasprobably a mere imitation of a flag he had seen years ago at Tanana,copied without knowledge of the meaning of the letters, as the Esquimauxoften copy into the decoration of their clothing and equipment thelegends from canned foods.Lake Minchúmina drains by a fork of the Kantishna River into the Tananaand so into the Yukon. Just beyond the southwestern edge of the lakeruns a deep gully for perhaps a mile that leads to another lake calledTsórmina, which drains into Minchúmina. And just beyond Tsórmina is alittle height of land, on the other side of which lies Lake Sishwóymina,which drains into the Kuskokwim. So that little height of land isanother watershed between Alaska's two great rivers. Lakes Tsórmina andSishwóymina are not on any maps; indeed, this region has never beenmapped save very crudely from the distant flanks of Denali upon one ofAlfred Brook's early bold journeys into the interior of Alaska onbehalf of the Geological Survey. Although the Russians hadestablishments on the lower Kuskokwim seventy-five years ago, and theriver is the second largest in Alaska and easy of navigation, yet thewhite man had penetrated very little into this country until the Innokoand Iditarod "strikes" of 1908 and 1909 respectively.It was our plan to follow the main valley of the Kuskokwim until theconfluence of the Takotna with that stream, just below the junction ofthe main North and South Forks of the Kuskokwim, and then strikenorthwestward across country to the Iditarod.The snow had passed and the sun was bright and the thermometer aroundzero all day when we left Minchúmina to pursue our journey. The welcomechange in the weather had brought a still more welcome change in travel.The decided and continued thaw followed by sharp cold had put a crust onthe snow that would hold up the dogs and the sled and a man on smalltrail snow-shoes anywhere. Trail making was no longer necessary, and intwo days we made upward of fifty miles. So much difference does surfacemake.[Sidenote: TALIDA]Across the end of Lake Minchúmina, across Tsórmina and Sishwóymina and anumber of lesser lakes we went, following a faint show-shoe trailtowards a distant mountain group to the southwest, the Talida Mountains,at the foot of which lay the Talida village. On the other hand, to theeast and southeast, we had tantalising glimpses through haze and cloudof the two great mountains, and presently of the lesser peaks of thewhole Alaskan range, sweeping its proud curve to the coast. For a longway on the second day we travelled on the flat top of a narrow ridgethat must surely have been a lateral moraine of a glacier, what time theice poured down from the heights and stretched far over thisvalley--then through scattered timber, increasing in size and thicknessand already displaying character that differed somewhat from thefamiliar forests of the Yukon. The show-shoe trail we were following wasmade by a messenger despatched by the Minchúmina people to invite theTalida people to a potlatch; for the caches were filled with moose meatbeyond local consumption. Early on the second day we met him returningand learned that he had gone on to yet another village a day's journeyfarther, still on our route.The people were all gone hunting from the tiny native hamlet of Talida,but we entered a cabin and made ourselves at home. We had passed intothe region where the Greek Church holds nominal sway, of which the iconswith little candles before them on the walls gave token. No priest evervisits them, but a native at a village on the south fork where is achurch holds some position analogous to that of a lay reader. Thenearest priest is a half-breed, ill spoken of for irregularity of life,some two hundred miles farther down the river. The Greek Church isrelaxing its hold in Alaska, perhaps inevitably, and suffers sadly sincethe removal of the bishop from Sitka from lack of supervision. Also wehad passed out of Indian country into the land of the Esquimaux, forthese people, far up towards the head of the river as they were, hadyet come at some period from the mouth. We were out of Walter's languagerange now, and were glad that the bilingual John of the march countrywas with us to serve as interpreter.Standing proudly up against the wall in one corner of the cabin was arather pathetic object to my eyes--an elaborate gilt-handled silkumbrella. There needed no one to tell its story; it spoke of a visit tothe Yukon with furs to sell and the usual foolish purchase of gay andglittering trash--novel and quite useless. What easy prey these poorpeople are to the wiles of the trader! Said one of them to me recently,when I asked the purpose of an "annex" to his store with a hugebilliard-table in it--at an exclusive native village--"It's to get theirmoney; there's no use trying to fool you; if we can't get it one waywe've got to get it another." This gorgeous silk umbrella was concreteexpression of the same sentiment. It was bought outside, it was broughtinto the country, it was set on exhibition in the store, because sometrader judged it likely to attract a native eye. No one, white ornative, uses an umbrella in interior Alaska.We made twenty-five miles the next day through a wide, open country,well wooded in places with a park-like distribution of trees, unwontedin our travels and attractive. A new species of spruce threw thickbranches right down to the ground and tapered up to a perfect cone; eachtree apart from the others and surrounded by sward instead ofunderbrush. There was a dignity about these trees that the common Yukonspruce never attains. Rolling hills of small elevation stretched oneither hand and game signs abounded. After eight hours of such travelwe spoke of camping, but presently saw footprints in the snow and pushedon to the bank of a little river, the Chedolothna, where stood a cabin,a tent, and several high caches. Here, with two families that occupiedthe cabin, we stayed the night.[Sidenote: MEASLES AND DIPHTHERIA]Six people at this place, six at Talida, sixteen at Minchúmina, make upall the population of a region perhaps a hundred and fifty miles square.Yet it is a noble Indian country, one of the most favourable in all theinterior, capable of supporting hundreds of people. Signs, indeed, of amuch larger occupation of it were not wanting, and all accounts speak ofthe wholesale destruction of the natives by disease. We were told of avillage a little farther up this stream where every living being, saveone old man, died of diphtheria five years previously, while those whohave heard the stories of the horrors of the epidemic of measles in1900, usually connected in some way with the stampede to Nome of thatyear when the disease seems to have entered the country, will understandhow a region once thickly peopled, for Alaska, has become the mostthinly peopled in all the territory.A half-breed trader, long resident at a point perhaps two hundred mileslower down the Kuskokwim, told me of coming back to a populous villageafter an absence of a few weeks, to find every person dead and thestarving dogs tearing at the rotting corpses. It is terrible to thinkwhat the irruption of a new disease may mean to these primitive natives.Even a disease like measles, rarely fatal and not commonly regarded asserious amongst whites, takes to itself a strange and awful virulencewhen it invades this virgin blood. The people know no proper treatment;maddened by the itching rash that covers the body, they fling off allcover, rush outdoors naked, whatever the weather, and either roll in thesnow or plunge into the stream; with the result that the disease"strikes in" and kills them. Such is the description that is given ofits course along the lower Yukon and Kuskokwim. At many a Yukon villagehalf the people died, despite the aid the few missionaries then on theriver could afford; upon the Kuskokwim the havoc seems to have beenstill greater. Six years later, death again stalked through this regionafter having visited the Yukon, and this time seized his victims by thethroat. In another chapter has been given some account of an outbreak ofdiphtheria on the Chandalar, following a more serious epidemic at CircleCity and Fort Yukon. It was during that same winter the disease raged inthis region, remote from any sort of medical or even intelligent layaid, and swept off all the children that had been spared by the measlesor had been born since that time. At our next stopping-place we saw thegraves of nineteen children who died in one day![Sidenote: THE INDIAN GUIDE]We learned that we were now within one day's travel of a road-house, ator near the junction of the forks of the Kuskokwim, and that agovernment trail had been surveyed and staked from the Iditarod to theSushitna, passing close to the same point, and that during the presentwinter road-houses had sprung up along the western portion of it, sothat we should not have to make camp again on the way to Iditarod City.All of which Minchúmina John had collected from the people in thecabin, and now presented to me as reason why he should be released fromfurther service. I was loath to let him go until we were actually _at_the road-house described, but he wanted to go back to the lake for thepotlatch then preparing, and said that two days' delay would bar himfrom the best of the festivities.So I settled with him, giving him fifty dollars of the sixty dollarscovenanted to the Iditarod, and grub enough to take him back to thelake, and a rifle, for he was unprovided with firearms, and he went hisway back, richly content, to the gorging of unlimited moose meat thatawaited him, and the boy and I went ours. So far as merely his companywas concerned I was not sorry to lose him. The old saying holds goodupon the trail that "two is company and three is none." He interferedwith my boy's lessons. Since he had scarce any English, and could not beignored, the conversation was mainly in Indian. In a word he pulled thecompany down to a native level. And I was anxious that Walter'seducation should proceed.This boy had been with me for two years, winter and summer, and it was agreat pleasure to witness his gracious development of body, mind, andcharacter. Clean-limbed, smooth-skinned, slender, and supple, his Indianblood showing chiefly in a slight swarth of complexion and aquilinity offeature, he now approached his twentieth year and began to gain thestrength of his manhood and to give promise of more than the averagestature and physical power. With only one full year's schooling behindhim, the year before he came to me, his active intelligence had madesuch quick use of it that there was good foundation to build upon; andour desultory lessons in camp--reading aloud, writing from dictation,geography and history in such snippets as circumstances permitted--wereeagerly made the most of, and his mental horizon broadened continually.Until his sixteenth year he had lived amongst the Indians almostexclusively and had little English and could not read nor write. He wasadept in all wilderness arts. An axe, a rifle, a flaying knife, a skinneedle with its sinew thread--with all these he was at home; he couldconstruct a sled or a pair of snow-shoes, going to the woods for hisbirch, drying it and steaming it and bending it; and could pitch campwith all the native comforts and amenities as quickly as anybody I eversaw. He spoke the naked truth, and was so gentle and unobtrusive inmanner that he was a welcome guest at the table of any mission wevisited. Miss Farthing at Nenana had laid her mark deep upon him in theone year he was with her.[Sidenote: THE HALF-BREED]Before he came to me I had another half-breed for two years, and beforethat there had been a series of full-blooded native boys. I found thehalf-breed greatly preferable. With full command of the native language,with such insight into the native mind as few white men ever attain, hecombines the white man's quickness of apprehension and desire forknowledge; and the companionship had been pleasant and profitable. Boththese boys had picked up quickly and efficiently, without the slightestprevious experience, the running and the care of the four-cylindergasoline engine of the mission launch, and took a great and intelligentinterest in all machinery. As an interpreter the half-breed is farsuperior to most full-bloods; he takes one's purport immediately; hismind seems to leap with the speaker's mind, not only to followfaithfully but to anticipate. And the further his English progresses, somuch the more excellent interpreter does he become.My heart goes out to the large and rapidly increasing number of theseyouths of mixed blood in Alaska. It is common to hear them spoken ofslightingly and contemptuously. There is what my mind always regards asa damnable epigram current in the country to the effect that thehalf-breed inherits the vices of both races and the virtues of neither.The white man who utters this saying with a chuckle at his second-handwit has generally not much virtue to transmit, were virtue heritable.But to thoughtful men nowadays this talk of the inheritance of virtuesand vices is mere folly. The half-breed in Alaska, as elsewhere, is theproduct of his environment. Often without legitimate father--although inan Indian community, where nothing is secret, his parentage is usuallywell known--he is left for some native woman to support with the aid ofher native husband. He is reared with the full-blooded offspring of thecouple in the frankness that knows no reserve and the intimacy thatknows no restraint, of Indian life. The full extent of that franknessand intimacy shocks even the loosest-living white man when he firstbecomes aware of it. Where religion and decency have not beenfaithfully inculcated there is no bound to it at all--it is complete.Presently, as his superior intellectual inheritance begins to manifestitself, as he grows up into consciousness that he is different from, andin many ways superior to, the Indians around him, he is naturally drawnto such white society as comes his way.[Sidenote: THE LOW-DOWN WHITE]In this book a good deal has been said, and, it may be thought by thereader, said with a good deal of asperity, about the whites who frequentIndian communities and come most into contact with the native people;yet the more the author sees of this class, the less is he disposed tomodify any of the strictures he has put upon it. "The Low-Down White" isthe subject of one of the most powerful and scathing of Robert Service'sballads, those most unequal productions with their mixture of strengthand feebleness, of true and forced notes, the best of which shouldcertainly live amongst the scant literature of the North. And, indeed,the spectacle of the man of the higher race, with all the age-longtraditions and habits of civilisation behind him, descending below thelevel of the savage, corrupting and debauching the savage and makingthis corrupting and debauching the sole exercise of his more intelligentand cultivated mind, is one that has aroused the disgust and indignationof whites in all quarters of the world. Kipling and Conrad have drawnhim in the East; Robert Louis Stevenson in the South Sea Islands; anyarmy officer will draw him for you in the Philippines, which lack as yettheir great delineator; Service has not overdrawn him on the Yukon.Now, it is to this man's society, for lack of other white society opento him, that the young half-breed who feels his father's blood stirringwithin him is drawn and is made welcome. He finds standards even lower,because more sophisticated, than the standards of the Indiansthemselves. He finds that honesty and morality are a sham, religion alaughing-stock. He finds the chastity of women and the honour of mensneeringly regarded as non-existent. He is taught to curse and swear, totalk lewdly, to drink and gamble. He is taught that drunkenness andsensuality are the only enjoyments worth looking forward to, and he soonbecomes as vile as his preceptors. The back room of the Indian trader'sstore is often the scene of this tuition--barroom, assignation house,gambling hell in one. But let that same youth be taken early in hand byone who has a care for him and will be at some personal pains to trainhim cleanly and uprightly, and he is as amenable to the good influencesas he would be to the bad if they were his sole environment. Consciousall the time of his equivocal position, shy and timid about assertinghimself amongst whites, he is easy prey to the viciously as he is aptpupil to the virtuously disposed.What is said here of the male half-breeds applies _a fortiori_ to thefemale. Unless early taken in hand by the missionary, or put under theprotection of some church boarding-school--and sometimes despite allsuch care and teaching--the lot of the half-breed girl is a sad one; andsome of the lowest and vilest women of the land are of mixed blood.The half-breed is assuredly to be reckoned with in the future of Alaska.He is here to stay. He is here in increasing numbers. He is the naturalleader of the Indian population. There seems little doubt that when hecares to assert his rights he is already an American citizen, althoughjudicial decisions are uncertain and conflicting in this matter.The missions in the interior have recognised, though perhaps somewhattardily, the importance of the half-breeds, and have picked them up hereand there along the rivers and become responsible for their decentrearing. Some, assuredly, of the future leaders of the native people arenow in training at the mission schools. Some, unfortunately, are inquite as assiduous training by the unscrupulous Indian trader and hiscoterie of low-down whites.The skies had threatened snow since we arose, and when our diminishedexpedition was well upon its way the snow began to fall. For thirty-sixhours it fell without cessation. Three days of good travel had put usforward seventy-five or eighty miles; now once more we were "up against"deep snow and trail breaking. An old native whom we met on his way tothe potlatch later in the day spread out his hands with a look ofdespair and cried: "Good trail all lose'm!" All day we pushed on againstthe driving storm, the flakes stinging our faces and striking painfullyagainst our eyeballs, now following a narrow steep woodland trail, nowawhile along a creek bed, now across open country with increasingdifficulty in finding our way, until it grew dark while yet we weresome miles from our destination, and we made camp; and all night longthe heavy snow continued.So soon as we had struck our tent, crusted with ice, and had broken upour wet camp next morning there was trouble about finding the trail.Wide open spaces with never an indication of direction stretched beforeus. Again and again we cast about, the boy to the left, I to the right,to find some blaze or mark, but much of the course lay across opencountry that bore none. And then I sorely regretted having let John goback. Some miles before we came to a stop the previous evening, wepassed a native encampment with naught but women and children in it--themen gone hunting. But we could not speak with them or get anyinformation from them, for our Kuskokwim interpreter was gone. And nowit seemed likely that we should lose our way in this wilderness. At lastwe were entirely at a loss, the boy returning on the one side and I onthe other from wide detours, in which we had found no sign at all. Thesnow still fell heavily; there lay more than a foot of it upon the latecrust; trail or sign of a trail, on the snow or above it, was not atall.[Sidenote: THE DOG GUIDES]Then occurred one of the most remarkable things I have known in all myjourneyings. Straight ahead in the middle distance I spied two straydogs making a direct course towards us; not wandering about, butevidently going somewhere. Now there are no such things as unattacheddogs in Alaska; any dog entirely detached from human ownership and somesort of human maintenance would soon be a dead dog. The explanation,full of hope, sprang at once to the boy's mind. The dogs must belong tothe native encampment some six miles back, and they had been to theroad-house for what scraps they could pick up, and were returning. Itwas probably a daily excursion and they had doubtless followed theiraccustomed trail. So it turned out. All the way to that road-house,eight miles farther, we followed the trail left by those dogs, growingfainter and fainter indeed as the new snow fell upon it, but stilldiscernible until we had almost reached the road-house. It led acrossopen swampy wastes, and presently across two considerable lakes, overwhich we should never have been able to find our way, for the trailswung to one hand or the other and did not leave the lake in the samegeneral direction by which it had reached it. Walter cut a bundle ofboughs and staked the trail out as we pursued it, lest we should returnthis way, but from the moment we saw the dogs there was never anyquestion about the trail; they kept it perfectly. We were four and ahalf hours making the eight miles or so to Nicoli's Village and theroad-house, but we might have been days making it but for those dogs.And at the road-house we learned that the boy's theory of theirmovements was the right one. They came across the twelve or fourteenmiles every day for such scraps as they could pick up.[Sidenote: THE WILDERNESS POET]So here was our first white man in sixteen days, an intelligent man ofmeagre education, with a great bent for versifying. A courteous approvalof one set of verse brought upon us the accumulated output of years inthe wilderness without much opportunity of audience, as one supposes,and most of the afternoon and evening was thus spent. Amidst theoverwrought sentimentality and faulty scansion which marked most of thepieces was one simple little poem that struck a true note, said itslittle say, and quit--without a superfluous word. Its author set nostore by it at all compared with his more pretentious and meretriciouswork; yet it was the one poem in the whole mass. It described thewriting of a letter to his father; he had spent all he had inprospecting and working a small claim, and had just realised that ayear's labour was gone for naught. His father would worry if he got noword at all, but there was no use telling the old man he was broke, sohe just wrote that he was well, and that was all. The old man would comepretty near understanding anyway. In simple lines that scanned andrhymed naturally, that was what the three or four stanzas said. And itwas so typical of many a man's situation in this country, gave so simplyand well the reason why many men cease writing to their relatives atall, that it pleased me and seemed of value. That note came from theheart and from the life's experience.Nicoli's Village is a very small place with a mere handful of people,situated on the South Fork of the Kuskokwim some forty miles by riverabove the junction of the forks. Before the epidemics devastated it ithad been a considerable native community. A Greek church, which thenatives built entirely themselves, and which boasted a large paintedicon of sorts, was the most important building in the place, and wasserved by the lay minister referred to before. Thus far the Kuskokwimis navigable for vessels of light draught, and a small stern-wheelsteamboat lay wintering upon the bank.[Sidenote: ROAD-HOUSES]Our way now left the Kuskokwim and struck across country to a point justbelow the junction of the forks, and then across country again to atributary of the right bank, the Takotna; with a general northerlydirection. Road-houses there indeed were, in the crudity and discomfortof their first season, and other evidences of the proximity of the whiteman. Here were two men camped, hunting moose for the Iditarod market,more than a hundred and twenty-five miles away, and here, at the end ofthe second day, near the mouth of the Takotna, was the new post of theCommercial Company in the charge of an old acquaintance who welcomed uswarmly and entertained us most hospitably. After camping and road-houseexperience of nearly three weeks, a comfortable bed and well-spreadtable, and the general unmistakable ménage of a home-making woman arevery highly enjoyed. That night the whole population of the settlement,fourteen persons, gathered in the store for Divine service.Sixteen miles farther on was another settlement, the "Upper Takotna"Post, with a rival company established and some larger population. Here,also, we spent a night with old Fairbanks acquaintances. We were yet ahundred miles from Iditarod City, and the trail lay over a very rugged,hilly country, up one creek to its head, over a divide, and downanother, in the way of the usual cross-country traverse.There had not been so much snowfall in this section, but the weatherbegan to be very severe. The thermometer fell to -45° and -50° and -55°on three successive nights, and all day long rose not above -20°, with akeen wind. The cost of transporting supplies to the road-houses on thistrail justified the high prices charged--one dollar and a half for apoor meal of rabbits and beans and bacon, or ptarmigan and beans andbacon, and one dollar for a lunch of coffee, bread and butter, and driedfruit. But no such exigency could be pleaded to excuse the dirt anddiscomfort and lack of the commonest provision of outhouse decency atmost of these places--'twas mere shiftlessness. There is not often muchmiddle ground in Alaskan road-houses; they are either very good in theirway or very bad; either kept by professional victuallers who take pridein them or by idle incompetents who make an easy living out of thenecessities of travellers. One wishes that some of the old-timetravellers who used to wax so eloquently indignant over the inns in thePyrenees could make a winter journey in the interior of Alaska.[Illustration: "THE 'SUMMIT' IS HIGH ABOVE TIMBER-LINE AND THE TRAILPURSUES A HOGBACK RIDGE FOR A MILE AND A HALF AT THE SUMMIT LEVEL."][Illustration: A STREET IN IDITAROD CITY.]One thing pleased me at these road-houses. The only reading-matter inany of them consisted of magazines bearing the rubber stamp of SaintMatthew's Reading-Room at Fairbanks, part of a five-hundred-pound cargoof magazines which the mission launch _Pelican_ brought to the Iditarodthe previous summer; virtually the only reading-matter in the wholecamp. It was pleasant to know that we had been able to avert the realcalamity of a total absence of anything to read for a whole winterthroughout this wide district. But, although they were brought to theIditarod and distributed absolutely free, each of these magazines hadcost the road-house keeper twenty-five cents for carriage over the trailfrom Iditarod City, and they had been read to death. Some of them wereso black and greasy from continued handling that the print at the edgesof the pages was almost unreadable.These creeks swarmed with ptarmigan, and it was well they did, for thenew camp was ill supplied with food, and we found ourselves in a regionof growing scarcity as we approached the Iditarod. The ptarmigan seem tohave supplemented the meagre stocks in the Iditarod during this winterof 1910-11 as effectively as the rabbits did in the Fairbanks camp inthe scarce winter of 1904-5. In place after place the whole creekvalley, where it was open, was crisscrossed with ptarmigan tracks, andthe birds rose in coveys, uttering their harsh, guttural cry at everyturn of the trail.The summit between the head of Moose Creek and the head of Bonanza Creekis again a watershed between the waters of the Kuskokwim and the watersof the Yukon; for Moose Creek is tributary to the Takotna and BonanzaCreek is tributary to Otter Creek, which is tributary to the IditarodRiver. The "summit" is high above timber-line, and when the trail hasreached it it does not descend immediately but pursues a hogback ridgefor a mile and a half at about the summit level. We passed over it inclear, bright weather without difficulty, but it would be a bad passagein wind or snow or fog. The rugged, broken country, with small, roundeddomes of hills, stretched away in all directions, a maze of littlevalleys threading in and out amongst them.[Sidenote: PLACE-NAMES]The Bonanza Creek road-house was by far the best of any between theKuskokwim and the Iditarod, and showed what can be done for comfort,even under adverse circumstances, by a couple who care and try. But howthe names of gold-bearing creeks, or creeks that are expected to begold-bearing are repeated again and again in every new camp! I oncecounted up the following list of mining place-names in Alaska: BonanzaCreeks, 10; Eldorados and Little Eldorados, 10; Nugget Creeks orGulches, 17; Gold Creeks, 12; Gold Runs, 7. Nor is it only in creekswith auriferous deposit or expectation of auriferous deposit that thisreduplication occurs; there are Bear Creeks, 16; Boulder Creeks, 13;Moose Creeks, 13; Willow Creeks, 17; Canyon Creeks, 12; Glacier Creeks,14.The imagination of the average prospector is not his most activefaculty, but even when his imagination is given play and he names aplace "Twilight," as he did the original settlement at this base ofsupplies, the ineradicable prose of trade comes along the next summerand changes it to "Iditarod City." There must have been some remarkablepersonality strong enough to repress the "chamber of commerce" atTombstone, Arizona, or the place would have lost its distinctive name sosoon as it grew large enough to have mercantile establishments insteadof stores.[Sidenote: IDITAROD CITY]We went through "Discovery Otter" and into "Flat City," on Flat Creek,the jealous rival of Iditarod City, and so over the hills to IditarodCity, on the wings of a storm. The wind whirled the snow behind us anddrove the sled along almost on top of the dogs. In its bleak situationand its exposure to the full force of the wind, Iditarod City remindsone of Nome or Candle on the Seward Peninsula. The hills and flats thatsurround it are in the main treeless, and the snow drifts and drivesover everything. Almost all the week that we spent in the town it wassmothered up in a howling wind-storm, so that it was quite a seriousundertaking to walk a block or two along the streets. Deep drifts werepiled up on all the corners and on the lee side of all buildings. Wereached Iditarod City on Monday, the 13th of March. Until the followingFriday morning was no cessation or moderation of the wind-storm; andthis, they told us, represented most of the weather since the 1st ofJanuary.Overgrown and overdone in every way, the place presented all thefeatures, sordid and otherwise, of a raw mining town. Prices had risenenormously on all manner of supplies, for everything that was notactually "short" was believed to be "cornered." Bacon was ninety cents apound; butter one dollar and a half a pound; flour was twenty dollars ahundred pounds, and most things in like ratio. Some said the grub wasnot in the camp; others that the tradesmen had it cached away waitingfor the still higher prices they believed would obtain before freshsupplies could arrive in July. There was a general feeling ofdisappointment and discouragement, enhanced by discomfort and actualsuffering from the terrible stormy weather of the winter and theexorbitant and growing price of provisions. Many men without occupationwere living on one meal a day. The saloons and the parasitical classes,male and female, seemed to flourish and to play their usual prominentpart in the life of such places. The doings of notorious women whosesobriquets seemed household words, the lavish expenditures of certainmen upon them, the presents of diamonds they received, with the amountpaid for them, constituted a large part of the general talk.One is compelled to admire the vigour and enthusiastic enterprise,daunted by no difficulty, that is displayed in the wonderfully rapidupraising of a new mining-camp town. The building goes far ahead of theknown wealth of the camp and commonly far ahead of the reasonableexpectation. But the element of chance is so important a factor inplacer mining that the whole thing partakes more of the nature ofgambling than of a commercial venture. Any new camp may suddenly presentthe world with a new Klondike; with riches abundant and to spare forevery one who is fortunate enough to be on the spot. Here was Flat Creekwith a surprisingly rich deposit; why should there not be a dozen suchamidst the multitudinous creeks of the district? How could any one knowthat it would be almost the only creek on which pay would be found atall? For there is no law about the distribution of gold deposits; thereis not even a general rule that has not its notable exceptions. It isvery generally believed by the old prospectors and miners that somewherein the Bible may be found these words, "Silver occurs in veins, but goldis where you find it," which of course, is a mere misreading or faultyremembering of a verse in the Book of Job: "Surely there is a vein forthe silver and a place for the gold where they fine it" (refine it). Butthat "gold is where you find it" is about the only law touchingauriferous deposits that holds universally good.Three long parallel streets of one and two story wooden buildings, withcross streets connecting them, made up the town. Because the country ispoorly timbered, the usual log construction had yielded in the main toframed buildings, and great quantities of lumber had been brought theprevious summer from Fairbanks, and even from Nome and the outside, tosupplement the low-grade output of two local mills. But the price ofbuilding materials had been very high, and the average dwelling was verysmall and incommodious. People accustomed to the comparative luxury ofthe older camps had suffered a good deal from the lack of all domesticconveniences in this new will-o'-the-wisp of an eldorado.So there the town stretched away, lumber and paper,--the usualtinder-box Alaskan construction--stores slap up against one another,with no alleyways between; in the busiest part of it and along thewater-front even an adequate provision of side streets grudged;furnace-heated and kiln-dried and gasoline-lit; waiting for the carelessmatch and the fanning wind and the five minutes' start that should sendit all up in smoke. A week after we left it came; as it came to Dawson,as it came to Nome, as it came to Fairbanks, without teaching any lessonor leaving any precautionary regulations on the statute book to savemen from their own competitive greed. Two or three weeks after the fire,however, it was all rebuilt, and a plunging local bank held mortgages onmost of the structures for the cost of the new material--and holds themyet.[Sidenote: THOUSANDS WITHOUT CHURCH]With at least a thousand people resident in the town, not to mention thethousands more out upon the creeks and at Flat City and "Discovery[G]Otter," there was no minister of religion of any sort in the wholeregion, nor had public Divine service been conducted since the occasionof the _Pelican's_ visit the previous summer. Yet there were many in theplace who sorely missed the opportunities of worship. Twice on Sundaythe largest dancing hall in the town was crowded at service; at night itcould have been filled a second time with those unable to get in.Places like this present very difficult problems to those desirous ofproviding for their religious need. To occupy them at all they should beoccupied at once when yet eligible sites may be had for the staking; ifthey prosper, to come into them later means buying at a high price. Yetwhat seventh son of a seventh son shall have foresight enough to tellthe fortunes of them? The North is strewn with "cities" of one winter.Nor is the selection of suitable men to minister to such communities asimple matter. Amidst the overthrow of all the usual criteria ofconduct, the fading out of the usual dividing lines and the blendinginto one another of the usual divisions, it requires a tactful andprudent man "to keep the happy mean between too much stiffness inrefusing and to much easiness in admitting" variations from conventionalstandards. His point of view, if he is to have any influence whatever,must not exclude the point of view of the great majority; he must acceptthe situation in order to have any chance of improving the situation.And yet in the fundamentals of character and conduct he must beunswerving. And if on any such fundamental the battle gauge is throwndown, he must take it up and fight the quarrel out at whatever cost.We left Iditarod City on Monday, the 20th of March, the dogs the fatterand fresher for their week's rest, resolved not to return by theKuskokwim but to take the beaten trail out to the Yukon, and so all theway up that stream to Fort Yukon. The monthly mail had arrived a fewdays previously--a monthly mail was all that the thousands of men inthis camp could secure--and had gone out again the very next morning,before people had time to answer their letters, before the registeredmail had even been delivered. So our departure for the Yukon was eagerlyseized upon and advertised as a means of despatching probably the lastmail that would go outside over the ice. I was sworn in as specialcarrier, and a heavy sack of first-class mail added to our load as faras Tanana. The first stage of thirty miles led to Dikeman, a town at theheadwaters of ordinary steamboat navigation of the Iditarod River, atwhich the Commercial Company had built a depot and extensive warehouse,since in the main abandoned. Two streets of cabins lined the bank, butforty or fifty souls comprised the population, and almost all of themgathered for Divine service that night.[Sidenote: THE "MOVING OF THE MEAT"]From Dikeman to Dishkaket, on the Innoko River, a distance of someseventy miles, our route lay over one of the dreariest and most dismalregions in all Alaska. It is one succession of lakes and swamps, withnarrow, almost knife-edge, ridges between, fringed with stunted spruce.Far as the eye could reach to right and left the country was the same;it is safe to say broadly that all the land between the Iditarod andInnoko Rivers is of this character. We passed over it in mild weather,but it must be a terrible country to cross in storm or through deepsnow. For ten miles at a stretch there was scarcely a place where a manmight make a decent camp. At a midway road-house was gathered thegreatest assemblage of dogs and loaded sleds I had ever seen together atone time, each team with an Indian driver; they must have covered aquarter or a third of a mile. It was a freight train engaged intransporting a whole boat-load of butcher's meat to Iditarod City, thecargo of a steamboat that had frozen in on the Yukon the previousOctober or early November. All the winter through efforts had been madeto get this meat two hundred odd miles overland to its destination; butthe weather had been so stormy and the snow so deep that near the end ofMarch most of it was still on the way, and some yet far down the trailtowards the Yukon waiting for another trip of the teams.Dishkaket was merely a native village on the Innoko River two or threeyears before; but since three new trails from the Yukon come togetherhere--from Kaltag Nulato, and Lewis's Landing--and in the otherdirections two trails branch off here, to the Innoko diggings at Ophirand to the Iditarod, a store or two and a couple of road-houses hadsprung up.From Dishkaket, after crossing the Innoko, we took the most northerly ofthe three trails to the Yukon, the Lewis Cut-Off, a trail of a hundredmiles that strikes straight across country and reaches the Yukon eightymiles farther up that stream than the Nulato trail and a hundred andtwenty miles farther up than the Kaltag trail. The Kaltag trail is thetrail to Nome; the Nulato trail is the mail trail simply because itsuits the contractors to throw business to Nulato. The Lewis Cut-Off isthe direct route, the shortest by about a hundred miles, but it was cutby the private individual whose name it bears, and leads out to hisstore and road-house on the Yukon; so a rival road-house was built closeby on the river and the prestige and advertisement of the "United Statesmail route" thrown to the trail that covers one hundred unnecessarymiles--for no other reason than to deprive Lewis of the legitimate fruitof his enterprise.The character of the country changed so soon as the Innoko was crossed;the wide swamps gave place to a broken, light-timbered country of ridgesand hollows, and the rough, laborious, horse-ruined trail across it madebad travelling. "Buckskin Bill," with his cayuses, was also engaged in"moving the meat." The measured miles, moreover, gave place to estimatedmiles, and the nominal twenty-five we made the first day was probablynot much more than twenty.[Sidenote: MILLINERY]The first fifty miles of the country between the Innoko and the Yukon ismuch the same, and we were climbing and descending ridges for a coupleof days. Then we crossed a high ridge and dropped out of Innoko watersinto the valley of the Yukatna, a tributary of the Yukon, and passeddown this valley for thirty or forty miles, and then across some morebroken country to the Yukon. At one of the road-houses a woman wasstopping, going in with three or four large sled loads of millinery and"ladies' furnishings." We were told that the merchandise had cost hertwelve thousand dollars in Fairbanks, and that she expected to realisethirty thousand dollars by selling it to the "sporting" women of theIditarod, now a whole winter debarred from "the latest imported Frenchfashions." This woman was dressed in overalls, like a man, and thedrivers of her teams, two white men and a native, cursed and swore andused filthy language to the dogs in her presence. It always angers me tohear an Indian curse; to hear one curse in the presence of a white womanwas particularly disgusting and exasperating; but what could one expectwhen the white men put no slightest restraint upon themselves and thewoman seemed utterly indifferent? I called the Indian aside and spokevery plainly to him, and he ceased his ribaldry; but the white men stillpoured it out as they struggled to hitch their many dogs. At last Icould stand it no longer. "Madam," I said to the woman, "I don't knowwho you are, save that you are a white woman, and as a white woman,if I were you, I would make those blackguards treat me with more respectthan to use such language before me." She flushed and made no reply. Themen, who heard what I said, scowled and made no reply. Presentlydispositions were done and the train moved off, but I did not hear anymore foul language. This is set down here chiefly because it was thefirst and only time in all his travels in Alaska that the writer heardsuch language in such presence.[Illustration: THE END OF THE PORTAGE TRAIL.][Illustration: ROUGH ICE ON THE YUKON.]Another road-house was kept by a man who had been cook upon a recentarctic expedition off the coast of Alaska, and he gave some interestinginside information about an enterprise the published narrative of whichhad always seemed unsatisfactory. It was just gossip from a drunkenscamp, but it filled several gaps in the book.As we approached the Yukon we passed several meat caches where greatquarters of beef sewn up in burlap were piled on the side of the trail.At one of these caches the camp-robbers had been at work industriously.They had stripped the burlap from parts of several quarters, exposingthe fat, and had dug out and carried it away little by little until itwas all gone. The hard-frozen lean probably defied their best efforts;at any rate, the fat offered less resistance. But where else in theworld could men dump quarters of beef beside the road and go off andleave them for weeks with no more danger of depredation than the billsof birds can effect?A few miles from the river the rival road-house signs began to appear."Patronise Lewis; he cut this trail at his own expense," pleaded one."Why go five miles out of your way," sneered another. Lewis'sroad-house _is_ across the wide Yukon, and there was no point incrossing the river save one's determination to lend no countenance tothe spitefulness of these mail runners. So across the river we went andwere glad to be on the Yukon again. The next morning we encountered thesame rival signs at the point where the trail from Lewis's joined the"mail trail."[Sidenote: "TREASURE ISLAND"]Most of our travelling was now upon the surface of the Yukon, and fourhundred and fifty miles of it stretched ahead of us ere our winter'stravel should end at Fort Yukon. Four hours brought us to the militarytelegraph station at Melozi, and we were able to send word ahead that wewere safely out of the Kuskokwim wilderness. Then a portage was crossedand then the river pursued again until with about thirty miles to ourcredit we made camp. The days were lengthening out now, the weathergrowing mild, although a keen, cold, down-river breeze was rarelyabsent, and travel began to be pleasant and camping no hardship. Wepreferred camping, on several scores, when the day's work had not beentoo arduous, chief amongst them being that it gave more opportunity andprivacy for Walter's schooling. He was reading _Treasure Island_ aloud,and I was getting as great pleasure from renewing as he from beginningan acquaintance with that prince of all pirate stories. Kokrines andMouse Point one day, the next The Birches; we passed these well-knownYukon landmarks, camping, after a run of thirty-eight miles, some sixmiles beyond the last-named place, with a run of forty-four miles beforeus to Tanana. I judged it too much; but the trail was greatly improvedand we decided to attempt it in one stage. A misreading of the watch, sothat I roused myself and Walter at 3.30 A. M. instead of 5.15 A. M., anddid not realise the mistake until the fire was made and it was not worthwhile returning to bed, gave us a fine start and we made good progress.Gold Mountain (so called, one supposes, because there is no gold there;there is no other reason), Grant Creek, "Old Station" were passed by,and at length Tanana loomed before us while yet ten miles away. In justeleven hours we ran the forty-four miles, making, with three additionalmiles out to the mission, forty-seven altogether, by far the longestjourney of the winter. We reached Tanana on the 1st of April, just sixweeks since we left.[Sidenote: AN UNTRAVELLED RIVER]We spent eight days at Tanana, including two Sundays, Passion Sunday andPalm Sunday, but I was under an old promise to spend Easter there also.Now, Easter, 1911, fell on the 16th of April, and for thethree-hundred-mile journey to Fort Yukon a period of ten or twelve daysat the least would be necessary, that might easily stretch to two weeks.Travelling on the Yukon ice so late in April as this would involve wasnot only fraught with great difficulty and discomfort, but also withactual danger, and I had to beg to be absolved of my promise. Someconsiderable preparation was on foot for the festival, and I was loathto leave, for Tanana was then without any resident minister, but itseemed foolish to take the chances that would have to be taken if westayed.Five days of almost ceaseless snow-storm during our stay at Tanana didnot give prospect of good travelling, and, indeed, when we pulled outfrom the mission on the Monday in Holy Week there was no sign of anytrail. From Tanana up to Fort Yukon there is very little travel; sincethe whole of this long stretch of river was deprived of winter mail ayear or two before, no through travel at all. Cabins may usually befound to camp in, but there are no road-houses. What travel still takesplace is local.The journey divided itself into two roughly equal parts, a hundred andfifty miles through the Lower Ramparts, and a hundred and fifty milesthrough the Yukon Flats, almost all of it on the surface of the river.It was hoped to reach Stephen's Village, a native settlement just withinthe second half of the journey, for Easter.Snow does not lie long at rest upon the river within the Ramparts, andparticularly within the narrow, cañon-like stretch of seventy-five milesfrom Tanana to Rampart City. Violent and almost ceaseless down-streamwinds sweep the deep defile in the mountains through which the riverwinds its course. In places the ice is bare of snow; in places the snowis piled in huge, hardened drifts. So strong and so persistent is thiswind that it is often possible to skate over an uninterrupted blacksurface of ice, polished like plate glass, for twenty miles on adown-river journey. To make way over such a surface up-stream, againstsuch wind, is, however, almost impossible. The dogs get no footing andthe wind carries the sled where it listeth. The journey so far asRampart City has been described before; it will suffice now that ittook three days of toilsome battling against wind and bad surface, withnights spent upon the floor of grimy cabins. So cold was the wind thatit is noted in my diary with surprise, on the 12th of April, that I hadworn fur cap, parkee, and muffler all day, as though it had been thedead of winter instead of three weeks past the vernal equinox.On Wednesday night there was Divine service at Rampart, and on MaundyThursday, after four miles upon the river, we took the portage of elevenmiles that cuts a chord to the arc of the greatest bend of the riverwithin the Ramparts and so saves nine miles. Three miles more took us tothe deserted cabin at the site of the abandoned coal-mine opposite themouth of the Mike Hess River, here confluent with the Yukon, and in thatcabin we spent the night, having had the high, bitter wind in our facesall day. We hated to leave the shelter of the wooded portage and facethe blast of the last three miles.[Sidenote: WIND AND SNOW]We woke the next morning to a veritable gale of wind and snow, and layin the cabin till noon, occupied with the exercises of the solemnanniversary. The wind having then abated somewhat and the snow ceased,we sallied forth, still hopeful of making Stephen's Village for Easter.But when we got down upon the river surface it became doubtful if wecould proceed, and as we turned the first bend we encountered a freshgale that did not fall short of a blizzard. The air was filled withflying snow that stung our faces and blinded us. The dogs' muzzlesbecame incrusted with snow and their eyes filled with it so that it washard to keep them facing it. I could not see the boy at all when he wasa hundred feet ahead of the team. We struggled along for four miles,and, since it was then evident that we could not go much farther withoutuseless risk, we turned to a spot on the bank where Walter knew anotherdeserted cabin to stand; for he knows every foot of this section of theriver and once spent a summer, camped at the coal-mine, fishing. Thespot was reached, but the cabin was gone. The fish rack still stoodthere, but the cabin was burned down. There was nothing for it but toreturn to the coal-mine cabin; so, for the first and only time in all myjourneyings, it was necessary to abandon a day's march that had beenentered upon and go back whence we had come. We ran before the gale atgreat speed and were within the cabin again by 2.30 P. M. All theevening and all night the storm raged, and I was in two minds aboutrunning back to Rampart before it for Easter, since it was now out ofthe question to reach Stephen's Village. If the season had not been sofar advanced this is what I should have done, but it would set us backthree days more on the journey, and on reflection I was not willing totake that chance with the break-up so near.So on the morning of Easter Eve we sallied up-stream again, snow fallingand driving heavily, and the wind still strong but with yesterday's keenedge blunted. By the time we had beaten around the long bend up which wehad fought our way the day before, the snow had ceased, and by noon thewind had dropped and the sun was shining, and in a few moments of hisunobscured strength all the loose snow on the sled was melted--awarning of the rapidity with which the general thaw would proceed oncethe skies were clear. That night saw us in the habitable though dirty,deserted cabin at Salt Creek (so called, one supposes, because the waterof it is perfectly fresh) at which we had hoped to lodge the previousnight.[Sidenote: ALASKAN "FORTS"]Buoyed by the hope of doing a double stage in a clear, windless day andthus reaching Stephen's Village for service at night, we made a veryearly start that beautiful Easter morning. But it was not to be. Suchtrail as there was ran high up on the bank ice--level, doubtless, whenit was made much earlier in the season, but now at a slope towards themiddle of the river through the falling of the water, and seamed withgreat cracks. Such a trail, called a "sidling" trail in the vernacularof mushing, is always difficult and laborious to travel, for the sledslips continually off it into the loose snow or the ice cracks, andoften for long stretches at a time one man must hold up the nose of thesled while the other toils at the handle-bars. In one place, while thusholding the front of the sled on the trail, Walter slipped into an uglyice crack concealed by drifted snow, and so wedged his foot that I haddifficulty in extricating him. The last two bends of the river withinthe Ramparts seemed interminable and it was 6.30 P. M., with twelvehours' travel behind us, when we reached old Fort Hamlin, on the vergeof the Yukon Flats. These "forts," it might be explained, if one choseto pursue the elucidation of Alaskan nomenclature in the same strain,are so called because they never had any defences and never needed any.As a matter of fact, in the early days, when the Hudson Bay Companymade its first establishments on the upper river, there was supposed tobe some need of fortification, and Fort Selkirk and Fort Yukon werestockaded. Fort Selkirk, indeed, was sacked and burned sixty years ago,but not by Yukon Indians. The Chilkats from the coast, indignant at theloss of their middle-man profits by the invasion of the interior,crossed the mountains, descended the river, and destroyed the post. Itthus became customary to call a trading-post a "fort," and every littlepoint where a store and a warehouse stood was so dignified. Hence FortReliance, Fort Hamlin, Fort Adams.For years Fort Hamlin had been quite deserted, but now smoke issued fromthe stovepipe and dogs gave tongue at our approach, and we found a whiteman with an Esquimau wife from Saint Michael and a half-breed childdwelling there and carrying a few goods for sale. With him we made ourlodging, and with him and his family said our evening service of Easter,and so to bed, thoroughly tired.[Sidenote: TRAVELLING BY NIGHT]A mile beyond Fort Hamlin the Ramparts suddenly cease and the wideexpanse of the Yukon Flats opens at once. Ten miles or so brought us toStephen's Village, where we had been long expected and where a very busyday was spent. A number of Indians were gathered and there were childrento baptize and couples to marry, as well as the lesson of the season toteach. It was a great disappointment that we had been unable to get herebefore, and matter of regret that, being here at such labour, only soshort a time could be spent. But the closing season called to usloudly. A mild, warm day set all the banks running with melting snow andmade the surface of the river mushy. There was really no time to lose,for the next seventy-five miles was to give us the most difficult anddisagreeable travelling of the journey. Here, in the Flats, where isgreatest need of travel direction on the whole river, was no trail atall beyond part of the first day's journey. Within the Ramparts theriver is confined in one channel; however bad the travelling may be,there is no danger of losing the way; but in the Flats the river dividesinto many wide channels and these lead off into many more back sloughs,with low, timbered banks and no salient landmarks at all. Behind us werethe bluffs of the Ramparts, already growing faint; afar off on thehorizon, to the right, were the dim shapes of the Beaver Mountains. Allthe rest was level for a couple of hundred miles.A local trail to a neighbouring wood-chopper's took us some twelvemiles, and then we were at a loss. The general direction we knew, andprevious journeys both in winter and summer gave us some notion of theriver bends to follow, but we wallowed and floundered until late atnight before we reached the cabin we were bound for, the snow exceedingsoft and wet for hours in the middle of the day.The time had plainly come to change our day travel into night travel,for freezing was resumed each night after the sun was set, and thesurface grew hard again. So at this cabin we lay all the next day, withan interesting recluse of these parts who knows many passages ofShakespeare by heart, and who drew us a chart of our course to the nexthabitation, marking every bend to be followed and the place where theriver must be crossed. But there is always difficulty in getting a newtravel schedule under way, and we did not leave until five in themorning instead of at two as we had planned. This gave us insufficienttime to make the day's march before the sun softened the snow, andmoccasins grew wet, and snow-shoe strings began to stretch, and thewebbing underfoot to yield and sag--and we had to content ourselves withhalf a stage. By nine P. M. we were off again and did pretty well untilthe night grew so dark that we could no longer distinguish ourlandmarks. Then we went to the bank and built a big fire and made a potof tea and sat and dozed around it for a couple of hours or so until thebrief darkness of Alaskan spring was overpast, and the dawn began togive light enough to see our way again.When our course lay on the open river, the snow had crust enough to holdus upon our snow-shoes; but when it took us through little shelteredsloughs, the crust was too thin and we broke through all the time, andthat makes slow, painful travel. At last we came to a portage that cutsoff a number of miles, but the snow slope by which the top of the bankshould be reached had a southern exposure and was entirely melted andgone. The dogs had to be unhitched, the sled to be unloaded, the stuffpacked in repeated journeys up the steep bank, and the sled hauled upwith a rope. Then came the repacking and reloading and the rehitching;and when the portage was crossed the same thing had to be done to getdown to the river bed again. Twice more on that day the process was gonethrough, and each time it took nigh an hour to get up the bank, so thatit was around noon, and the snow miserably wet and mushy again, when wereached Beaver and went to bed at the only road-house between Fort Yukonand Tanana."Beaver City" owes its existence to quartz prospects in the Chandalar,in which men of money and influence in the East were interested. TheAlaska Road Commission had built a trail some years before from theChandalar diggings out to the Yukon, striking the river at this point,and on the opposite side of the river another trail is projected and"swamped out" direct to Fairbanks. The opening up of this route wasexpected to bring much travel through Beaver, and a town site was stakedand many cabins built. But "Chandalar quartz" remains an interestingprospect, and the Chandalar placers have not proved productive, and allbut a few of the cabins at "Beaver City" are unoccupied. If "theChandalar" should ever make good, "Beaver City" will be its river port.[Sidenote: LAST DAY]We left Beaver at eleven P. M. on Friday night, hoping in two longall-night runs to cover the eighty miles and reach Fort Yukon by Sundaymorning. Here was the first trail since we left Stephen's Village andthe first fairly good trail since we left Tanana, for there had beensome recent travel between Fort Yukon and Beaver. Here for the firsttime we had no need of snow-shoes, and when they have been wornvirtually all the winter through and nigh a couple of thousand milestravelled in them, walking is strange at first in the naked moccasin. Itis a blessed relief, however, to be rid of even the lightest of trailsnow-shoes. We stepped out gaily into a beautiful clear night, with asharp tang of frost in the air, and even the dogs rejoiced in theknowledge that the end of the journey was at hand. All night long wemade good time and kept it up without a stop until eight o'clock in themorning, when we reached an inhabited but just then unoccupied cabin andate supper or breakfast as one chooses to call it and went to bed,having covered fully half the distance to Fort Yukon. About noon we wererudely awakened by one of the usual Alaskan accompaniments ofapproaching summer. The heat of the sun was melting the snow above us,and water came trickling through the dirt roof upon our bed. We moved toa dry part of the cabin and slept again until the evening, and at nineP. M. entered upon what we hoped would be our last run.But once more our plans to spend Sunday were frustrated. The trail ledthrough dry sloughs from which the advancing thaw had removed the snowin great patches. Sometimes the sled had to be hauled over bare sand;sometimes wide detours had to be made to avoid such sand; sometimespools of open water covered with only that night's ice lay across ourpath. By eight o'clock in the morning we estimated that we were not morethan seven or eight miles from Fort Yukon. But already the snow grewsoft and our feet wet, and the dogs were very weary with the elevenhours' mushing. It would take a long time and much toil to ploughthrough slush, even that seven or eight miles. So I gave the word tostop, and we made an open-air camp on a sunny bank, and after breakfastwe covered our heads in the blankets from the glare of the sun, andslept till five. Then we ate our last trail meal, and were washed up andpacked up and hitched up an hour and more before the snow was frozenenough for travel. A couple of hours' run took us to Fort Yukon, and soended the winter journey of 1910-11, on the 23d of April, having beenstarted on the 17th of November. We were back none too soon. Every daywe should have found travelling decidedly worse. In a few more days theriver would have begun to open in places, and only the middle would besafe for travel, with streams of water against either bank and no way ofgetting ashore. Seventeen days later the ice was gone out and the Yukonflowing bank full.FOOTNOTE:[G] The "claim" on a creek on which gold is first found is called"Discovery"; the claims above are numbered one, two, three, etc.,"above" and the claims below, one, two, three, etc., "below."CHAPTER XITHE NATIVES OF ALASKAWHEN one contemplates the native people of the interior of Alaska in themass, when, with the stories told by the old men and old women of thedays before they saw the white man in mind, one reconstructs thatprimitive life, lacking any of the implements, the conveniences, thealleviations of civilisation, the chief feeling that arises is a feelingof admiration and respect.What a hardy people they must have been! How successfully for untoldgenerations did they pit themselves against the rigour of this mostinhospitable climate! With no tool but the stone-axe and the flintknife, with no weapon but the bow and arrow and spear, with no materialfor fish nets but root fibres, or for fish-hooks or needles but bone,and with no means of fire making save two dry sticks--one wonders at theskill and patient endurance that rendered subsistence possible at all.And there follows quickly upon such wonder a hot flush of indignationthat, after so conquering their savage environment or accommodatingthemselves to it, that they not only held their own but increasedthroughout the land, they should be threatened with a wantonextermination now that the resources of civilisation are opened to them,now that tools and weapons and the knowledge of easier and morecomfortable ways of life are available.The natives of the interior are of two races, the Indian and theEsquimau. The Indian inhabits the valley of the Yukon down to withinthree or four hundred miles of its mouth; the Esquimau occupies thelower reaches of the Yukon and the Kuskokwim and the whole of the riversthat drain into the Arctic Ocean west and north. These inland Esquimauxare of the same race as the coast Esquimaux and constitute aninteresting people, of whom something has been said in the account ofjourneys through their country.[Sidenote: THE ATHABASCANS]The Indians of the interior are of one general stock, the Athabascan, asit is called, and of two main languages derived from a common root butdiffering as much perhaps as Spanish and Portuguese. The language of theupper Yukon (and by this term in these pages is meant the upper AmericanYukon) is almost identical with the language of the lower Mackenzie,from which region, doubtless, these people came, and with it have alwaysmaintained intercourse. The theory of the Asiatic origin of the nativesof interior Alaska has always seemed fanciful and far-fetched to thewriter. The same translations of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayerserve for the lower Mackenzie and the upper Yukon and are in active useto-day through all that wide region, despite minor dialecticalvariations.Near the lower ramparts of the Yukon, at Stephen's Village, the languagechanges and the new tongue maintains itself, though with continuallyincreasing dialectical differences, until the Indians overlap theEsquimaux, six hundred miles farther down.Fort Yukon is the most populous place on the river, and the last placeon the river, where the upper language, or Takhud, is spoken. A stretchof one hundred and fifty miles separates it from the next nativevillage, and the inhabitants of that village are not intelligible to theFort Yukon Indians--an unintelligibility which seems to speak of longages of little intercourse.       *       *       *       *       *The history of the migrations of the Indians from the Athabascan orMackenzie region is impossible to trace now. It is highly probable thatthe movement was by way of the Porcupine River. And it would seem thatthere must have been two distinct migrations: one that passed down theYukon to the Tanana district and spread thence up the Tanana River andup the Koyukuk; and long after, as one supposes, a migration thatpeopled the upper Yukon. A portion of this last migration must have goneacross country to the Ketchumstock and the upper Tanana, for theinhabitants of the upper Tanana do not speak the Tanana tongue, which isthe tongue of the Middle Yukon but a variant of the tongue of the upperYukon.[Illustration: A DOCILE FOLK, EAGER FOR INSTRUCTION.][Illustration: THE MISSION TYPE.][Illustration: WILD AND SHY.]How long ago these migrations took place there is not the slightestknowledge to base even a surmise upon. The natives themselves have norecords nor even traditions, and the first point of contact betweenwhite men and the natives of the interior is within three quarters of acentury ago. It may have been two or three families only whichpenetrated to this region or to that and settled there, and whatpressure started them on their wanderings no one will ever know. Perhapssome venturesome hunter pursuing his game across the highlands thatseparate the Mackenzie from the Yukon was disabled and compelled toremain until the summer, and then discovered the salmon that made theirway up the tributaries of the Porcupine. The Mackenzie has no salmon. Ora local tribal quarrel may have sent fugitives over the divide.When first the white man came to the upper Yukon, in 1846 and 1847, noone knew that it was the same river at the mouth of which the Russianshad built Redoubt Saint Michael ten or twelve years before. The nativesof the upper river knew nothing about the lower river. It is an easymatter to float down the Yukon for a thousand miles in a birch-barkcanoe, but an exceedingly difficult matter to come up again. It was notuntil the voyageurs of the Hudson Bay Company, in their adventurousfur-trading expeditions, met at the mouth of the Tanana River the agentsof the Russian Fur Company, come up from Nulato on the same quest, thatthe identity of the Yukon and Kwikpak Rivers was discovered; and thatseems to have been well past the middle of the century. In the map ofNorth America that the writer first used at school, the Yukon flowednorth into the Arctic Ocean, parallel with the Mackenzie.[Sidenote: AN INOFFENSIVE PEOPLE]The Indians of the interior of Alaska are a gentle and kindly andtractable people. They have old traditions of bloody tribal warfare thathave grown in ferocity, one supposes, with the lapse of time, for it isvery difficult for one who knows them to believe that so mild a racecould ever have been pugnacious or bloodthirsty. Whether it were thatthe exigencies of subsistence under arctic conditions demanded almostall their energies, or that a realisation of their constant dependenceupon one another checked the play of passion, they differ most widelyand, it seems certain, always differed most widely in character from theIndians of the American plains. A personal knowledge of the greater partof all the natives of interior Alaska, gained by living amongst them andtravelling from village to village during seven or eight years,furnishes but a single instance of an Indian man guilty of any sort ofviolence against another Indian or against a white man--except under theinfluence of liquor.It is true that there are unquestioned murders that have beencommitted--murders of white men at that; but in the sixty years from theNulato massacre of 1851, over the whole vast interior, these crimes canbe counted on the fingers of one hand. They are not a revengeful people.They do not cherish the memory of injuries and await opportunities ofrepayment; that trait is foreign to their character. On the contrary,they are exceedingly placable and bear no malice. Moreover, they arevery submissive, even to the point of being imposed upon. In fact, theyare decidedly a timid people in the matter of personal encounter. In allthese characteristics they differ from the North American Indiangenerally as he appears in history.They are capable of hard work, though apparently not of continuous hardwork; they will cheerfully support great privation and fatigue; butwhen the immediate necessity is past they enjoy long periods of feastingand leisure. Having no property nor desire of property, save theirclothes, their implements and weapons, and the rude furnishings of theircabins, there is no incentive to hard and continuous work.After all, where is the high and peculiar virtue that lies in theperformance of continuous hard work? Why should any one labourincessantly? This is the question the Indian would ask, and one is notalways sure that the mills of Massachusetts and the coal-mines ofPennsylvania return an entirely satisfactory answer. As regards thrift,the Indian knows little of it; but the average white man of the countrydoes not know much more. There is little difference as regards thriftbetween wasting one's substance in a "potlatch," which is a feast forall comers, and wasting it in drunkenness, which is a feast for theliquor sellers, save that one is barbarous and the other civilised, asthe terms go.It would seem that the general timidity of the native character is thereason for a very general untruthfulness, though there one must speakwith qualification and exception. There are Indians whose word may betaken as unhesitatingly as the word of any white man, and there arewhite men in the country whose word carries no more assurance than theword of any Indian. The Indian is prone to evasion and quibbling ratherthan to downright lying, though there are many who are utterlyunreliable and untrustworthy.[Sidenote: SEXUAL MORALITY]In the matter of sexual morality the Indian standards are very low,though certainly not any lower than the standards of the average whiteman in the country. One is forced to this constant comparison; the whiteman in the country is the only white man the Indian knows anythingabout. To the Indian a physical act is merely a physical act; all downhis generations there has been no moral connotation therewith, and it ishard to change the point of view of ages when it affects personalindulgence so profoundly. The white man has been taught, down as manyages, perhaps, that these physical acts have moral connotation and areillicit when divorced therefrom, yet he is as careless and immoral inthis country as the Indian is careless and _un_moral. And the whiteman's careless and immoral conduct is the chief obstacle which those whowould engraft upon the Indian the moral consciousness must contendagainst.The Indian woman is not chaste because the Indian man does not demandchastity of her, does not set any special value upon her chastity assuch. And the example of the chastity which the white man demands of hiswomen, though he be not chaste himself, is an example with which thenative of Alaska has not come much into contact. Too often, in thevicinity of mining camps, the white women who are most in evidence areof another class.[Sidenote: GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS]The Indian is commonly intelligent and teachable, and in most caseseager to learn and eager that his children may learn. Here it becomesnecessary to deal with a difficult and somewhat contentious matter thatone would rather let alone. The government has undertaken the educationof the Indian, and has set up a bureau charged with the establishmentand conduct of native schools.There are five such schools on the Yukon between Eagle and Tanana,including these two points, amongst Indians all of whom belong to theEpiscopal Church, and five more between Tanana and Anvik, amongstnatives divided in allegiance between the Episcopal and the RomanCatholic Churches. Below Anvik to the river's mouth the natives aredivided between the Roman and the Greek Churches, and they are outsidethe scope of this book. On the tributaries of the Yukon the only nativeschools are conducted by the missions of the Episcopal Church, on theKoyukuk and Tanana Rivers, and have no connection with the government.When, somewhat late in the day, the government set its hand to theeducation of the natives, mission schools had been conducted for manyyears at the five stations of the Episcopal Church above Tanana and atthe various mission stations below that point. The Bureau of Educationprofessed its earnest purpose of working in harmony with the missionauthorities, and upon this profession it secured deeds of gift forgovernment school sites within the mission reservations from the Bishopof Alaska.It cannot be stated, upon a survey of the last five or six years, thatthis profession has been carried out. The administration of the Bureauof Education has shared too much the common fault of other departmentsof the government in a detached and lofty, not to say supercilious,attitude. Things are not necessarily right because a government bureauorders them, nor are government officials invested with superior wisdommerely by reason of their connection with Washington. It is just asimportant for a government school as for a mission school to be inharmony with its environment, to adapt itself to the needs of the peopleit designs to serve; and that harmony and adaptation may only be securedby a single-minded study of the situation and of the habits andcharacter, the occupations and resources of the people.To keep a school in session when the population of a village is gone onits necessary occasions of hunting or trapping, and to have the annualrecess when all the population is returned again, is folly, whoeverorders it, in accord with what time-honoured routine soever, and thishas not infrequently been done. Moreover, it is folly to fail torecognise that the apprenticeship of an Indian boy to the arts by whichhe must make a living, the arts of hunting and trapping, is moreimportant than schooling, however important the latter may be, and thatany talk--and there has been loud talk--of a compulsory education lawwhich shall compel such boys to be in school at times when they shouldbe off in the wilds with their parents, is worse than mere folly, andwould, if carried out, be a fatal blunder. If such boys grow upincompetent to make a living out of the surrounding wilderness, whenceshall their living come?The next step would be the issuing of rations, and that would mean theultimate degradation and extinction of the natives. When the question isstated in its baldest terms, is the writer perverse and barbarous anduncivilised if he avow his belief that a race of hardy, peaceful,independent, self-supporting illiterates is of more value and worthy ofmore respect than a race of literate paupers? Be it remembered also thatmany of these "illiterates" can read the Bible in their own tongue andcan make written communication with one another in the same--veryscornful as the officials of the bureau have been about such attainment.One grows a little impatient sometimes when a high official atWashington writes in response to a request for permission to use aschool building _after_ school hours, for a class of instruction in thenative Bible, that the law requires that all instruction in the schoolbe in the English language, and that it is against the policy ofCongress to use public money for religious instruction! When thethermometer drops to 50° below zero and stays there for a couple ofweeks, it is an expensive matter to heat a church for a Bible classthree times a week--and the schoolhouse is already cosy and warm.But the question does not reduce itself to the bald terms referred toabove; by proper advantage of times and seasons the Indian boy may haveall the English education that will be of any service to him, and mayyet serve his apprenticeship in the indispensable wilderness arts. And,given a kindly and competent teacher, there is no need of any sort ofcompulsion to bring Indian boys and girls to school when they are withinreach of it.The Indian school problem is not an easy one in the sense that it can besolved by issuing rules and regulations at Washington, but it can besolved by sympathetic study and by the careful selection of intelligent,cultured teachers.After all, this last is the most important requisite. Too often it isassumed that any one can teach ignorant youth: and women with no cultureat all, or with none beyond the bald "pedagogy" of a low-gradeschoolroom, have been sent to Alaska. There have, indeed, been notableexceptions; there have been some very valuable and capable teachers, andwith such there has never been friction at the missions, but gladco-operation.The situation shows signs of improvement; there are signs of withdrawalfrom its detached and supercilious attitude on the part of the bureau,signs which are very welcome to those connected with the missions. Forthe best interest of the native demands that the two agencies at workfor his good work heartily and sympathetically together. The missionscan do without the government--did do without it for many years, thoughglad of the government's aid in carrying the burden of the schools--butthe government cannot do without the missions; and if the missions wereforced to the re-establishment of their own schools, there would beempty benches in the schools of the government.[Sidenote: THE THREAT OF EXTINCTION]That the Indian race of interior Alaska is threatened with extinction,there is unhappily little room to doubt; and that the threat may beaverted is the hope and labour of the missionaries amongst them. At mostplaces where vital statistics are kept the death-rate exceeds thebirth-rate, though it is sometimes very difficult to secure accuratestatistics and to be sure that they always cover the same ground. Thenatives wander; within certain territorial limits they wander widely.Whenever a child is born it is certain that if it lives long enough itwill be brought to a mission to be baptized, but a death often occurs atsome isolated camp that is not reported till long after, and may escaperegistration altogether.Certain diseases that have played havoc in the past are not much fearednow. For the last seven years supplies of the diphtheritic antitoxinhave been kept at all the missions of the Episcopal Church, and in thesummer of 1911, when there was an outbreak of smallpox at PorcupineRiver, almost every Indian of interior Alaska was vaccinated, mainly bythe mission staffs. Diphtheria has been a dreadful scourge. The valleyof the upper Kuskokwim was almost depopulated by it in 1906. A diseaseresembling measles took half the population of the lower Yukon villagesin 1900. In the last few years there have been no serious epidemics; butepidemic disease does not constitute the chief danger that threatens thenative.[Sidenote: DWELLING AND CLOTHING]That chief danger looms from two things: tuberculosis and whisky.Whether tuberculosis is a disease indigenous to these parts, or whetherit was introduced with the white man, has been disputed and would bedifficult of determination. Probably it was always present amongst thenatives; the old ones declare that it was; but the changed conditions oftheir lives have certainly much aggravated it. They lived much more inthe open when they had no tree-felling tool but a stone-axe and did notbuild cabins. The winter residence in those days was, it is true, adark, half-underground hut covered with earth and poles, but the time ofresidence therein was much shorter; the skin tent sheltered them most ofthe year. Indeed, some tribes, such as the Chandalar, lived in theirskin tents the year round. Now an ill-ventilated and very commonlyovercrowded cabin shelters them most of the year. It is true that thecabins are constantly improving and the standard of living within themis constantly rising. The process is slow, despite all urgings andwarnings, and overcrowding and lack of ventilation still prevail.[Illustration: THE NATIVE COMMUNICANT.][Illustration: RAW MATERIAL.]Perhaps as great a cause of the spread of tuberculosis is the change inclothing. The original native was clad in skins, which are the warmestclothing in the world. Moose hide or caribou hide garments, tanned andsmoked, are impervious to the wind, and a parkee of muskrat or squirrel,or, as was not uncommon in the old days, of marten, or one of cariboutanned with the hair on, with boots of this last material, give all thewarmth that exposure to the coldest weather requires. Nowadays furgarments of any sort are not usual amongst the natives. There is amarket, at an ever-growing price, for all the furs they can procure. Alaw has, indeed, gone recently into effect prohibiting the sale ofbeaver for a term of years, and already beaver coats and caps begin toappear again amongst the people. It would be an excellent, wise thing,worthy of a government that takes a fatherly interest in very childlikefolks, to make this law permanent. If it were fit to prohibit thesale of beaver pelts for a term of years to protect the beaver, surelyit would be proper to perpetuate the enactment to protect the Indian. Itwould mean warm clothing for man, woman, and child.[Illustration: AN ESQUIMAU YOUTH.][Illustration: A HALF-BREED INDIAN.][Sidenote: THE INDIAN TRADER]The Indian usually sells all his furs and then turns round and buysmanufactured clothing from the trader at a fancy price. That clothing isalmost always cotton and shoddy. Genuine woollens are not to be found inthe Indian trader's stock at all, and in whatever guise it maymasquerade, and by whatever alias it may pass, the native wear iscotton. Yet there is no country in the world where it is moreimperative, for the preservation of health, that wool be worn.However much fur the Indian may catch and sell, he is always poor. He ispaid in trade, not in cash; and when the merchant has bought theIndian's catch of fur he straightway spreads out before him an alluringdisplay of goods specially manufactured for native trade. Here arebrilliant cotton velvets and sateens and tinselled muslins and gayribbons that take the eye of his women folk; here are trays of Brummagemknickknacks, brass watches, and rings set with coloured glass, gorgeouscelluloid hair combs, mirrors with elaborate, gilded frames, and brasslamps with "hand-painted" shades and dangling lustres; here are Germanaccordions and mouth-organs and all sorts of pocket-knives andalarm-clocks--the greatest collection of glittering and noisy trash thatcan be imagined, bought at so much a dozen and retailed, usually, atabout the same price for one. And when the Indian has done his tradingthe trader has most of his money back again.The news that an Indian has caught a black fox, the most exciting itemof news that ever flies around a native village, does not give any greatpleasure to one who is acquainted with native conditions, because heknows that it will bring little real benefit to the Indian. There willbe keen competition, within limits, of course, amongst the traders forit; and the fortunate trapper may get three or four hundred dollars intrade for a skin that will fetch eight hundred or a thousand in cash onthe London market; but if his wife get the solid advantage of a newcooking-stove or a sewing-machine from it she is doing well.Food the Indian never buys much beyond his present need, unless it is tosquander it in feast after feast, to which every one is invited and atwhich there is the greatest lavishness. If a son is born, or a black foxis caught, or a member of the family recovers from a severe illness,custom permits, if it do not actually demand, that a "potlatch" begiven, and most Indians are eager, whenever they are able, to be theheroes of the prandial hour.So he, his women, and his children go clad mainly in cotton, and thereis abundant evidence that the tendency to pulmonary trouble, alwayslatent amongst them, is developed by the severe colds which they catchthrough the inadequate covering of their bodies, and is then cherishedinto virulent activity by the close atmosphere of overcrowded,overheated cabins.The missions help the Indians, especially the women and children, inthis matter of clothing as much as possible. Every year large bales ofgood though left-off under and over wear are secured through churchorganisations outside, and are traded to the natives at nominal prices,usually for fish or game or a little labour in sawing wood. And thisnaturally does not ingratiate missions with the trading class. One'sanger is aroused sometimes at seeing the cotton-flannel underclothes and"cotton-filled" blankets and the "all-wool" cotton coats and trouserswhich they pay high prices for at the stores. The Canadian Indians, whoare their neighbours, buy genuine Hudson Bay blankets and other realwoollen goods, but the Alaskan Indian can buy nothing but cotton.But far and away beyond any other cause of the native decline stands thecurse of the country, whisky. Recognising by its long Indian experiencethe consequences of forming liquor-drinking habits amongst the natives,the government has forbidden under penalty the giving or selling of anyintoxicants to them. A few years ago a new law passed making such givingor selling a felony. These laws are largely a dead letter.[Sidenote: UNPAID COMMISSIONERS]The country is a very large one, very sparsely populated; the distancesare enormous, the means of transportation entirely primitive, and thepolice and legal machinery insufficient to the end of suppressing thisillicit traffic, especially in view of the fact that a considerable partof the whole population does not look with favour upon any vigorousattempt to suppress it. Great areas of the country are withouttelegraphic communication, and in parts mail is received only once amonth. One stretch of two hundred and fifty miles of the Yukon receivesno mail at all during the winter months--more than half the year. Inthat instance, as in many others, the country has gone distinctlybackward in the past few years. The magistrates--"commissioners" theyare called, receive no salary, but eke out a precarious and oftenwretched existence on fees, so that it is frequently impossible to getmen of character and capacity to accept such offices.One would have supposed that amongst all the legislating that has beendone for and about Alaska in the last year or two, one crying evil thatthe attention of successive administrations has been called to fortwenty years past would have been remedied. That evil is the unpaidmagistrate and the vicious fee system by which he must make a living. Itis a system that has been abolished in nearly all civilised countries; asystem that lends itself to all sorts of petty abuse; a system that noone pretends to defend. No greater single step in advance could be madein the government of Alaska, no measure could be enacted that would tendto bring about in greater degree respect for the law than the abolitionof the unpaid magistracy and the setting up of a body of stipendiariesof character and ability.The anomalies of the present situation are in some cases amusing. At oneplace on the Yukon it is only possible for a man to make a living asUnited States commissioner if he can combine the office of postmasterwith it. A man who was removed as commissioner still retained thepost-office, and no one could be found to accept the vacant judgeship.In another precinct the commissioner was moving all those whom hethought had influence to get him appointed deputy marshal instead ofcommissioner, because the deputy marshal gets a salary of two thousanddollars a year and allowances, which was more than the commissionershipyielded. One is reminded of some comic-opera topsyturvyism when thejudge tries in vain to get off the bench and be appointed constable. Itsounds like the _Bab Ballads_. The district court is compelled to winkat irregularities of life and conduct in its commissioners because itcannot get men of a higher stamp to accept its appointments.[Sidenote: LIQUOR AND POLITICS]The only policemen are deputy United States marshals, primarilyprocess-servers and not at all fitted in the majority of cases for anysort of detective work. Their appointment is often dictated and theiraction often hampered by political considerations. The liquor interestis very strong and knows how to bring pressure to bear against a marshalwho is offensively active. They are responsible only to the UnitedStates marshal of their district, and he is responsible to theattorney-general, the head of the department of justice. But Washingtonis a long way off, and the attorney-general is a very busy man, notwithout his own interest, moreover, in politics. An attempt to get somenotice taken of a particular case in which it was the general opinionthat an energetic and vigilant deputy had been removed, and an elderlylethargic man substituted, because of too great activity in theprosecution of liquor cases, resulted in the conviction that whatshould have been a matter of administrative righteousness only was apolitical matter as well.The threatened extinction of the Alaskan native was referred to aswanton, and the term was used in the sense that there are no necessarynatural causes fighting against his survival.Here is no economic pressure of white settlers determined to occupy theland, such as drove the Indians of the plains farther and farther westuntil there was no more west to be driven to. If such delusion possessany mind as a result of foolish newspaper and magazine writings, let itbe dismissed at once. No man who has lived in the country and travelledin the country will countenance such notion. The white men in Alaska areminers and prospectors, trappers and traders, wood-choppers andsteamboat men. Around a mining camp will be found a few truck-farmers;alongside road-houses and wood camps will often be found flourishingvegetable gardens, but outside of such agriculture there are, speakingbroadly, no farmers at all in the interior of Alaska. Probably amajority of all the homesteads that have been taken up have been locatedthat the trees on them might be cut down and hauled to town to be soldfor fire-wood. A few miles away from the towns there are no homesteads,except perhaps on a well-travelled trail where a man has homesteaded aroad-house.[Illustration: AN AGED COUPLE.][Illustration: FOOTBALL AT THE ALLAKAKET, EXPOSURE 1-1000 SECOND, APRIL,AFTER A NEW LIGHT SNOWFALL.]All the settlements in the country are on the rivers, save the purelymining settlements that die and are abandoned as the placers play out.Yet one will travel two hundred and fifty miles up the Porcupine--tillCanada is reached--and pass not more than three white men's cabins, allof them trappers; one will travel three hundred and fifty miles up theKoyukuk before the first white man's cabin is reached, and as many milesup the Innoko and the Iditarod and find no white men save wood-choppers.There are a few more white men on the Tanana than on any other tributaryof the Yukon, because Fairbanks is on that river and there is moresteamboat traffic, but they are mainly wood-choppers, while on thelesser tributaries of the Yukon, it is safe to say, there are no settledwhite men at all. As soon as one leaves the rivers and starts acrosscountry one is in the uninhabited wilderness.The writer is no prophet; he cannot tell what may happen agriculturallyin Alaska or the rest of the arctic regions when the world outside isfilled up and all unfrozen lands are under cultivation. Still less is heone who would belittle a country he has learned to love or detract inany way from its due claims to the attention of mankind. There is in theterritory a false newspaper sentiment that every one who lives in theland should be continually singing extravagant praises of it andcontinually making extravagant claims for it. A man may love Alaskabecause he believes it to have "vast agricultural possibilities,"because, in his visions, he sees its barren wilds transformed into"waving fields of golden grain." But a man may also love it who regardsall such visions as delusions.[Sidenote: FOOD AND FURS]The game and the fish of Alaska, the natural subsistence of the Indian,are virtually undiminished. Vast herds of caribou still wander on thehills, and far more are killed every year by wolves than by men. Greatnumbers of moose still roam the lowlands. The rivers still teem withsalmon and grayling and the lakes with whitefish, ling, and lush. Unlessthe outrage of canneries should be permitted at the mouths of theYukon--and that would threaten the chief subsistence of all the Indiansof the interior--there seems no danger of permanent failure of thesalmon run, though, of course, it varies greatly from year to year.Furs, though they diminish in number, continually rise in price. Thereare localities, it is true, where the game has been largely killed offand the furs trapped out; the Koyukuk country is one of them, thoughperhaps that region never was a very good game country. In this region,when a few years ago there was a partial failure of the salmon, therewas distress amongst the Indians. But the country on the whole is almostas good an Indian country as ever it was, and there are few signs thatit tends otherwise, though things happen so quickly and changes comewith so little warning in Alaska that one does not like to be tooconfident.The Indian is the only settled inhabitant of interior Alaska to-day; forthe prospectors and miners, who constitute the bulk of the whitepopulation, are not often very long in one place. Many of them mightrightly be classed as permanent, but very few as settled inhabitants. Itis the commonest thing to meet men a thousand miles away from the placewhere one met them last. A new "strike" will draw men from every miningcamp in Alaska. A big strike will shift the centre of gravity of thewhole white population in a few months. Indeed, a certain restlessbelief in the superior opportunities of some other spot is one of thecharacteristics of the prospector. The tide of white men that has flowedinto an Indian neighbourhood gradually ebbs away and leaves the Indianbehind with new habits, with new desires, with new diseases, with newvices, and with a varied assortment of illegitimate half-breed childrento support. The Indian remains, usually in diminished numbers, withimpaired character, with lowered physique, with the tag-ends of thewhite man's blackguardism as his chief acquirement in English--but heremains.It is unquestionable that the best natives in the country are those thathave had the least intimacy with the white man, and it follows that themost hopeful and promising mission stations are those far up thetributary streams, away from mining camps and off the routes of travel,difficult of access, winter or summer, never seen by tourists at all;seen only of those who seek them with cost and trouble. At such stationsthe improvement of the Indian is manifest and the population increases.By reason of their remoteness they are very expensive to equip andmaintain, but they are well worth while. One such has been described onthe Koyukuk; another, at this writing, is establishing with equalpromise at the Tanana Crossing, one of the most difficult points toreach in all interior Alaska.This chapter must not close without a few words about the nativechildren. Dirty, of course, they almost always are; children in a stateof nature will always be dirty, and even those farthest removed fromthat state show a marked tendency to revert to it; but when one hasbecome sufficiently used to their dirt to be able to ignore it, they arevery attractive. Intolerance of dirt is largely an acquired habitanyway. In view of their indulgent rearing, for Indian parents areperhaps the most indulgent in the world, they are singularly docile;they have an affectionate disposition and are quick and eager to learn.Many of them are very pretty, with a soft beauty of complexion and adelicate moulding of feature that are lost as they grow older. It takessome time to overcome their shyness and win their confidence, but whenfriendly relations have been established one grows very fond of them.Foregathering with them again is distinctly something to look forward toupon the return to a mission, and to see them come running, to have thempress around, thrusting their little hands into one's own or hanging toone's coat, is a delight that compensates for much disappointment withthe grown ups. In the midst of such a crowd of healthy, vivaciousyoungsters, clear-eyed, clean-limbed, and eager, one positively refusesto be hopeless about the race.CHAPTER XIIPHOTOGRAPHY IN THE ARCTICTHERE is no country in which an anastigmatic lens is of more use to thephotographer than Alaska, and every camera with which it is hoped totake winter scenes should have this equipment. During two or threemonths in the year it makes the difference in practice between gettingphotographs and getting none. In theory one may always set up a tripodand increase length of exposure as light diminishes. But the mostinteresting scenes, the most attractive effects often present themselvesunder the severest conditions of weather, and he must be an enthusiast,indeed, who will get his tripod from the sled, pull out its telescopedtubes, set it up and adjust it for a picture with the thermometer at 40°or 50° below zero; and when he is done he is very likely to be a frozenenthusiast.With an anastigmatic lens working at, say f. 6-3, and with a "speed"film (glass plates are utterly out of the question on the trail), it ispossible to make a snap-shot at one twenty-fifth of a second on a clearday, around noon, even in the dead of winter, in any part of Alaska thatthe writer has travelled in. There are those who write that they canalways hold a camera still enough to get a sharp negative at even onetenth of a second. Probably the personal equation counts largely insuch a matter, and a man of very decided phlegmatic temperament may haveadvantage over his more sanguine and nervous brother. The thing may bedone; the writer has done it himself; but the point is it cannot bedepended on; at this speed three out of four of his exposures will beblurred, whereas at one twenty-fifth of a second a sharp, clear negativemay always be secured.It may be admitted at once that at extremely low temperatures theworking of any shutter becomes doubtful, and most of them go out of anyreliable action altogether. After trying and failing completely withthree or four of the more expensive makes of shutters, the writer hasfor the last few years used a "Volute" with general satisfaction, thoughin the great cold even that shutter (from which all trace of grease oroil was carefully removed by the makers) is somewhat slowed up, so thata rare exposure at 50° or 60° below zero would be made at an indicatedspeed of one fiftieth rather than at one twenty-fifth, taking the chanceof an under-exposed rather than a blurred negative. To wish for ashutter of absolute correctness and of absolute dependability under allcircumstances, arranged for exposures of one fifteenth and one twentiethas well as one tenth and one twenty-fifth, is probably to wish for theunobtainable.[Sidenote: CARE OF FILMS AND CAMERAS]The care of the camera and the films, exposed and unexposed, the winterthrough, when travelling on the Alaskan trail, is a very important andvery simple matter, though not generally learned until many negativeshave been spoiled and sometimes lenses injured. It may be summed up inone general rule--keep instrument and films always outdoors.One unfamiliar with arctic conditions would not suppose that muchtrouble would be caused by that arch-enemy of all photographicpreparations and apparatus--damp, in a country where the thermometerrarely goes above freezing the winter through; and that is a justconclusion provided such things be kept in the natural temperature,outdoors. But consider the great range of temperature when thethermometer stands at -50° outdoors, and, say, 75° indoors. Here is adifference of 125°. Anything wooden or metallic, especially anythingmetallic, brought into the house immediately condenses the moisture withwhich the warm interior atmosphere is laden and becomes in a few momentscovered with frost. Gradually, as the article assumes the temperature ofthe room, the frost melts, the water is absorbed, and the damage is doneas surely as though it had been soused in a bucket. If it be necessaryto take camera and films indoors for an interior view--which one doessomewhat reluctantly--the films must be taken at once to the stove andthe camera only very gradually; leaving the latter on the floor, thecoldest part of the room, for a while and shifting its position nearerand nearer until the frost it has accumulated begins to melt, whereuponit should be placed close to the heat that the water may evaporate asfast as it forms.Outdoors, camera and films alike are perfectly safe, however intense thecold. Indeed, films keep almost indefinitely in the cold and do notdeteriorate at all. One learns, by and by, to have all films sentsealed up in tin cans, _and to put them back and seal them up again whenexposed_, despite the maker's instructions not to do so. The maker knowsthe rules, but the user learns the exceptions. When films are thusprotected they may be taken indoors or left out indifferently, as nomoist air can get to them.The rule given is one that all men in this country follow with firearms.They are always left outdoors, and no iron will rust outdoors in thewinter. Unless a man intend to take his gun to pieces and clean itthoroughly, he never brings it in the house. The writer has on severaloccasions removed an exposed film and inserted a new one outdoors, usingthe loaded sled for a table, at 50° below zero; taking the chance offreezing his fingers rather than of ruining the film. It is aninteresting exercise in dexterity of manipulation. Everything that canbe done with the mittened hand is done, the material is placed withineasy reach--then off with the mittens and gloves, and make the change asquickly as may be!There is just one brief season in the year when high speeds of shuttersmay be used: in the month of April, when a new flurry of snow has put amantle of dazzling whiteness upon the earth and the sun mountscomparatively high in the heavens. Under such circumstances there isalmost, if not quite, tropical illumination. Here is a picture of nativefootball at the Allakaket, just north of the Arctic Circle, made late inApril with a Graflex, fitted with a lens working at f. 4.5, at the fullspeed of its focal-plane shutter--one one-thousandth of a second. Infive years' use that was the only time when that speed was used, or anyspeed above one two-hundred-and-fiftieth. Commonly, even in summer, manymore exposures are made with it at one fiftieth than at oneone-hundredth, for this is not a brightly lit country in summer, andnearly all visitors and tourists find their negatives much under-timed.The Graflex, though unapproached in its own sphere, is not a goodall-round camera, despite confident assertions to the contrary. It istoo bulky to carry at all in the winter, and its mechanism is apt torefuse duty in the cold. The 3A Graflex cannot be turned to make aperpendicular photograph, but must always be used with the greatestdimension horizontal. Except in brilliant sunshine it is difficult toget a sharp focus, and, even though the focus appear sharp on the groundglass, the negative may prove blurred. Then the instrument is a greatdust catcher and seems to have been constructed with a perverseingenuity so as to make it as difficult as possible to clean.The writer uses his Graflex almost solely for native portraits andstudies, for which purpose it is admirable, and has enabled him tosecure negatives that he could not have obtained with any other handcamera. Even in the summer, however, he always carries his 3A FoldingPocket Kodak as well, and uses it instead of the Graflex for landscapesand large groups. If he had to choose between the two instruments andconfine himself to one, he would unhesitatingly choose the FoldingPocket Kodak.The difficulties of winter photography in Alaska do not end with themaking of the exposure. All water must be brought up in a bucket from awater-hole in the river, and though it be clear water when it is dippedup from under the ice, it is chiefly ice by the time it reaches thehouse, during any cold spell. One learns to be very economical of waterwhen it is procured with such difficulty, learns to dry prints withblotting-paper between the successive washings, which is the best way ofwashing with the minimum of water. Blotting-paper is decidedly cheaperthan water under some circumstances.While the rivers run perfectly clear and bright under the ice in thewinter, in summer the turbid water of nearly all our large streamsintroduces another difficulty, and photographic operation must sometimesbe deferred for weeks, unless the rain barrels be full or enough ice befound in the ice-house, over and above the domestic needs, to serve.[Sidenote: EFFECT OF COLD ON EMULSIONS]It seems certain that the speed of the sensitive emulsions with whichthe films are covered is reduced in very cold weather. To determinewhether or not this was so, the following experiments were resorted to.The camera was brought out of the house half an hour before noon, at 50°below zero, and an exposure made immediately. Then the camera was leftin position for an hour and another exposure made. There was littledifference in the strength of the negatives, and what difference therewas seemed in favour of the second exposure. Evidently, if the emulsionhad slowed, the shutter had slowed also; so opportunity was awaited tomake a more decisive test. When there remained but one exposure on aroll of film, the camera was set outdoors at a temperature of 55° belowzero and left for an hour. Then an exposure was made and the film woundup and withdrawn; while a new film, just brought from the house, was asquickly as possible inserted in its place and a second exposure made.The latter was appreciably stronger. Even this test is, of course, notentirely conclusive; one would have to be quite sure that the emulsionswere identical; but it confirms the writer's impression that extremecold slows the film. It would be an easy matter for the manufacturers tosettle this point beyond question in a modern laboratory, and it iscertainly worth doing.There is much sameness about winter scenes in Alaska, as the reader hasdoubtless already remarked; yet the sameness is more due to a lack ofalertness in the photographer than to an absence of variety. If thetraveller had nothing to think about but his camera, if all otherconsiderations could be subordinated to the securing of negatives, then,here as elsewhere, the average merit of pictures would be greater.Sometimes the most interesting scenes occur in the midst of stress ofdifficult travel when there is opportunity for no more than a fleetingrecognition of their pictorial interest. "Tight places" often makeattractive pictures, but most commonly do not get made into pictures atall. The study of the aspects of nature is likely to languish amidst thesevere weather of the Northern winter, and the bright, clear, mild daygets photographed into undue prominence. Snow is more or less white andspruce-trees in the mass are more or less black; one dog team is verylike another; a native village has to be known very well, indeed, to bedistinguishable from another native village. Yet there is individuality,there is distinction, there is variety, there is contrast, if a man havebut the grace to recognise them and the zeal to record them. Snow itselfhas infinite variety; trees, all of them, have characters of their own.Dogs differ as widely as men and Indians as widely as white men.[Sidenote: INDIANS AND PHOTOGRAPHS]The fear of the camera, or the dislike of the camera, that used toaffect the native mind is gone now, save, perhaps, in certain remotequarters, and these interesting people are generally quite willing tostand still and be snapped. They ask for a print, and upon one's nextvisit there is clamorous demand for "picter, picter." A famous Frenchphysician said that his dread of the world to come lay in hisexpectation that the souls he met would reproach him for not havingcured a certain obstinate malady that he had much repute in dealingwith; so the travelling amateur in photography sometimes feels hisconscience heavy under a load of promised pictures that he has forgottenor has been unable to make. He feels that his native friends whom heshall meet in the world to come will assuredly greet him with "where'smy picture?" The burden increases all the time, and the Indian neverforgets. It avails nothing even to explain that the exposure was afailure. A picture was promised; no picture has been given; that is asfar as the native gets. And the making of extra prints, in the caseswhere it is possible to make them, is itself quite a tax upon time andmaterial.Just as it is true that to be well informed on any subject a man mustread a great deal and be content not to have use for a great deal thathe reads, so to secure good photographs of spots and scenes of note ashe travels, he must make many negatives and be content to destroy many.The records of a second visit in better weather or at a more favourableseason will supersede an earlier; typical groups more casual ones. Thestandard that he exacts of himself rises and work he was content withcontents him no more. Sometimes one is tempted to think that the maindifference between an unsuccessful and a successful amateur photographeris that the former hoards all his negatives while the latterrelentlessly burns those which do not come up to the mark--if not atonce, yet assuredly by and by. So the surprise that one feels at many ofthe illustrations in modern books of arctic travel is not that thetravellers made such poor photographs but that they kept them and usedthem; for there can be no question that poor photographs are worse thannone at all.CHAPTER XIIITHE NORTHERN LIGHTSTHE Northern Lights are a very common phenomenon of interior Alaska,much more common than in the very high latitudes around the North Pole,for it has been pretty well determined that there is an auroral pole,just as there is a magnetic pole and a pole of cold, none of whichcoincides with the geographical Pole itself. All the arctic explorersseem agreed that north of the 80th parallel these appearances are lessin frequency and brilliance than in the regions ten or fifteen degreesfarther south. It may be said roundly that it is a rare thing in winterfor a still, clear night, when there is not much moon, to pass withoutsome auroral display in the interior of Alaska. As long as we have anynight at all in the early summer, and as soon as we begin to have nightagain late in the summer, they may be seen; so that one gains theimpression that the phenomenon occurs the year round and is merelyrendered invisible by the perpetual daylight of midsummer.[Sidenote: A GENERAL AURORA]The Alaskan auroras seem to divide themselves into two great classes,those that occupy the whole heavens on a grand scale and appear to be ata great distance above the earth, and those that are smaller and seemmuch closer. Inasmuch as a letter written from Fort Yukon to a town inMassachusetts describing one of the former class brought a reply that onthe same night a brilliant aurora was observed there also, it would seemthat auroras on the grand scale are visible over a large part of theearth's surface at once, whereas the lesser manifestations, thoughsometimes of great brilliance and beauty, give one the impression ofbeing local.One gets, unfortunately, so accustomed to this light in the sky inAlaska that it becomes a matter of course and is little noticed unlessit be extraordinarily vivid. Again, often very splendid displays occurin the intensely cold weather, when, no matter how warmly one may beclad, it is impossible to stand still long outdoors, and outdoors anobserver must be to follow the constant movement that accompanies theaurora. Moreover, there is something very tantalising in the observing,for it is impossible to say at what moment an ordinary waving auroralstreamer that stretches its greenish milky light across the sky,beautiful yet commonplace, may burst forth into a display of the firstmagnitude, or if it will do so at all.The winter traveller has the best chance for observing this phenomenon,because much of his travel is done before daylight, and often much morethan he desires or deserves is done after daylight; while, if hisjourneys be protracted so long as snow and ice serve for passage at all,towards spring he will travel entirely at night instead of by day.It is intended in this chapter merely to attempt a description of a fewof the more striking auroral displays that the writer has seen, theaccounts being transcribed from journals written within a few hours, atmost, from the time of occurrence, and in the first case written so soonas he went indoors.This was on the 6th of October, 1904, at Fairbanks, a little removedfrom the town itself. When first the heavens were noticed there was oneclear bow of milky light stretching from the northern to the southernhorizon, reflected in the broken surface of the river, and glistening onthe ice cakes that swirled down with the swift current. Then thesouthern end of the bow began to twist on itself until it had produced aqueer elongated corkscrew appearance half-way up to the zenith, whilethe northern end spread out and bellied from east to west. Then thewhole display moved rapidly across the sky until it lay low and faint onthe western horizon, and it seemed to be all over. But before one couldturn to go indoors a new point of light appeared suddenly high up in thesky and burst like a pyrotechnic bomb into a thousand pear-shapedglobules with a molten centre flung far out to north and south. Thenbegan one of the most beautiful celestial exhibitions that the writerhas ever seen. These globules stretched into ribbon streamers, dividingand subdividing until the whole sky was filled with them, and theseribbon streamers of greenish opalescent light curved constantly inwardand outward upon themselves, with a quick jerking movement like thecracking of a whip, and every time the ribbons curved, their lower edgesfrayed out, and the fringe was prismatic. The pinks and mauves flashedas the ribbon curved and frayed--and were gone. There was no othercolour in the whole heavens save the milky greenish-white light, butevery time the streamers thrashed back and forth their under edgesfringed into the glowing tints of mother-of-pearl. Presently, the wholedisplay faded out until it was gone. But, as we turned again to seek thewarmth of the house, all at once tiny fingers of light appeared all overthe upper sky, like the flashing of spicules of alum under a microscopewhen a solution has dried to the point of crystallisation, and stretchedup and down, lengthening and lengthening to the horizon, and gatheringthemselves together at the zenith into a crown. Three times this wasrepeated; each time the light faded gradually but completely from thesky and flashed out again instantaneously.For a full hour, until it was impossible to stand gazing any longer forthe cold, the fascinating display was watched, and how much longer itcontinued cannot be said. It was a grand general aurora, high in theheavens, not vividly coloured save for the prismatic fringes, but ofbrilliant illumination, and remarkable amongst all the auroras observedsince for its sudden changes and startling climaxes. Draped auroras arecommon in this country, though it has been wrongly stated that they areonly seen near open seas, but their undulations are generally moredeliberate and their character maintained; this one flashed on and offand changed its nature as though some finger were pressing buttons thatcontrolled the electrical discharges of the universe. Yet it was noticedthat even in its brightest moments the light of the stars could be seenthrough it.[Sidenote: A LOCAL AURORA]The next aurora to be described was of a totally different kind. Itoccurred on the 18th of March, 1905. The writer, with an Indianattendant, was travelling on the Koyukuk River from Coldfoot to Bettles,and, owing to a heavy, drifted trail, night had fallen while yet theroad-house was far away. There was no moon and the wind-swept trail waswholly indistinguishable from the surrounding snow, yet to keep on thetrail was the only chance of going forward at all, for whenever thetoboggan slid off into the deep, soft snow it came to a standstill andhad to be dragged laboriously back again. A good leader would have keptthe trail, but we had none such amongst our dogs that year. Thus,slowly, we went along in the dark, continually missing the trail on thisside and on that. We did not know on which bank of the river theroad-house was situated, for it was our first journey in those parts. Weonly knew the trail would take us there could we follow it. All at oncea light burst forth, seemingly not a hundred yards above our heads, thatlit up that trail like a search-light and threw our shadows black uponthe snow. There was nothing faint and fluorescent about that aurora; itburned and gleamed like magnesium wire. And by its light we were able tosee our path distinctly and to make good time along it, until in a mileor two we were gladdened by the sight of the candle shining in thewindow of the road-house and were safe for the night.Now, one does not really know that this was an aurora at all, save thatthere was nothing else it could have been. It was a phenomenonaltogether apart from the one first described; not occupying the vaultof heaven, streaming from horizon to zenith; not remote and majestic.There was really little opportunity to observe it at all; one's eyeswere fixed upon the trail it illumined, anxious not to set foot to theright or left. Save for an occasional glance upward, we saw only itsreflected light upon the white expanse beneath. It was simply a streakof light right above our heads, holding steadily in position, thoughfluctuating a little in strength--a light to light us home, that is whatit was to us. And it was the most surprising and opportune example ofwhat has been referred to here as the _local_ aurora that eight wintershave afforded. The most opportune but not the most beautiful; the nextto be described, though of the local order, was the most striking andbeautiful manifestation of the Northern Lights the writer has ever seen.It was that rare and lovely thing--a coloured aurora--all of one richdeep tint.[Sidenote: A RED AURORA]It was on the 11th of March, 1907, on the Chandalar River, a day's marchabove the gap by which that stream enters the Yukon Flats and five daysnorth of Fort Yukon. A new "strike" had been made on the Chandalar, anda new town, "Caro," established;--abandoned since. All day long we hadbeen troubled and hindered by overflow water on the ice, saturating thesnow, an unpleasant feature for which this stream is noted; and whennight fell and we thought we ought to be approaching the town, it seemedyet unaccountably far off. At last, in the darkness, we came to a creekthat we decided must surely be Flat Creek, near the mouth of which thenew settlement stood; and at the same time we came to overflow water sodeep that it covered both ice and snow and looked dangerous. So the dogswere halted while the Indian boy went ahead cautiously to see if thetown were not just around the bend, and the writer sat down, tired, onthe sled. While sitting there, all at once, from the top of themountainous bluff that marked the mouth of the creek, a clear red lightsprang up and spread out across the sky, dyeing the snow and gleaming inthe water, lighting up all the river valley from mountain to mountainwith a most beautiful carmine of the utmost intensity and depth. In waveafter wave it came, growing brighter and brighter, as though somegigantic hand on that mountain top were flinging out the liquid radianceinto the night. There was no suggestion of any other colour, it was allpure carmine, and it seemed to accumulate in mid-air until all thelandscape was bathed in its effulgence. And then it gradually died away.The native boy was gone just half an hour. It began about five minutesafter he left and ended about five minutes before he returned, so thatits whole duration was twenty minutes. There had been no aurora at allbefore; there was nothing after, for his quest had been fruitless, and,since we would not venture that water in the dark, we made our camp onthe bank and were thus two hours or more yet in the open. The boy hadstopped to look at it himself, "long time," as he said, and declared itwas the only red aurora he had ever seen in his twenty odd years' life.It was a very rare and beautiful sight, and it was hard to resist thatimpression of a gigantic hand flinging liquid red fire from the mountaintop into the sky. Its source seemed no higher than the mountaintop--seemed to be the mountain top itself--and its extent seemedconfined within the river valley.[Sidenote: A GRAND GENERAL DISPLAY]There is only one other that shall be described, although there are manymentioned with more or less particularity in the diaries of thesetravels. And this last one is of the character of the first and not atall of the second and third, for it was on the grand scale, filling allthe heavens, a phenomenon, one is convinced, of an order distinct anddifferent from the local, near-at-hand kind. There was exceptionallygood opportunity for observing this display, since it occurred during anall-night journey, the night of the 6th of April, 1912, with brilliantstarlight but no moon while we were hastening to reach Eagle for Easter.We had made a new traverse from the Tanana to the Yukon, through twohundred miles of uninhabited country, and had missed the head of thecreek that would have taken us to the latter river in thirty miles,dropping into one that meandered for upward of a hundred before itdischarged into the great river. It was one o'clock on Good Fridaymorning when we reached a road-house on the Yukon eighty miles fromEagle. The only chance to keep the appointment was to travel all the tworemaining nights. So we cached almost all our load at the road-house,for we should retrace our steps when Eagle was visited, and thus wereable to travel fast.Both nights were marked by fine auroral displays, so extensive and ofsuch apparent height as to give the impression that they must be visibleover large areas of the earth. Both continued all night long and wereof the same general description, but the second night's display wasemphasised in its main features and elaborated in its detail, and wasthe more striking and notable and worthy of description.It began by an exquisite and delicate weaving of fine, fluorescentfilaments of light in and out among the stars, until at times a perfectnetwork was formed, like lace amidst diamonds, first in one quarter ofthe heavens, then in another, then stretching and weaving its web rightacross the sky. The Yukon runs roughly north and south in these reaches,and the general trend of the whole display was parallel with the river'scourse. For an hour or more the ceaseless extension and looping of theseinfinitely elastic threads of light went on, with constant variation intheir brilliance but no change in their form and never an instant'scessation of motion.[Illustration: Photo by Paul Schultz.THE SUN DOGS.][Illustration: "TAN," OF MIXED BREED.][Illustration: "MUK," A PURE MALAMUTE.]Then the familiar feature of the draped aurora was introduced, always abeautiful sight to watch. Slowly and most gracefully issued out of thenorth band after band, band after band of pale-green fire, each curlingand recurling on itself like the ribbon that carries the motto under ashield of arms, and each continually fraying out its lower edge intosubdued rainbow tints. Then these bands, never for a moment still, weregathered up together to the zenith, till from almost all round thehorizon vibrant meridians of light stretched up to a crown of gloryalmost but not quite directly overhead, so bright that all the wavingbands that now assumed more the appearance of its rays paled before it.Then the crown began to revolve, and as it revolved with constantlyincreasing speed, it gathered all its rays into one gigantic spiral thattravelled as it spun towards the east until all form was dissipated in anebulous mist that withdrew behind the mountains and glowered there likea dawn and left the skies void of all light save the stars. It was afine instance of the stupendous sportiveness of the aurora thatsometimes seems to have no more law or rule than the gambolling of akitten, and to build up splendid and majestic effects merely to "whelmthem all in wantonness" a moment later. A particularly fine and strikingphase of an aurora is very likely to be followed by some such suddenwhimsical destruction. It was as though that light hidden behind themountains were mocking us.Then from out the north again appeared one clear belt of light thatstretched rapidly and steadily all across the heavens until it formed anarch that stood there stationary. And from that motionless arch, theonly motionless manifestation that whole night, there came a gradualsuperb crescendo of light that lit the wide, white river basin frommountain top to mountain top and threw the shadows of the dogs and thesled sharper and blacker upon the snow,--and in the very moment of itsclimax was gone again utterly while yet the exclamations of wonder wereon our lips. It was as though, piqued at our admiration, the aurora hadwiped itself out; and often and often there is precisely that impressionof wilfulness about it.All night long the splendour kept up, and all night long, as the dogswent at a good clip and one of us rode while the other was at thesled's handle-bars, we gazed and marvelled at its infinite variety, atits astonishing fertility of effect, at its whimsical vagaries, untilthe true dawn of Easter swallowed up the beauty of the night as we camein sight of Eagle. And we wondered with what more lavish advertisementthe dawn of the first Easter was heralded into the waste places of thesnow.[Sidenote: SOUND AND SMELL]There are men in Alaska, whose statements demand every respect, whoclaim to have heard frequently and unmistakably a swishing soundaccompanying the movements of the aurora, and there are some who claimto have detected an odour accompanying it. Without venturing any opinionon the subject in general, the writer would simply say that, though hethinks he possesses as good ears and as good a nose as most people, hehas never heard any sound or smelled any odour that he believed to comefrom the Northern Lights. Indeed, he has often felt that with all thelight-producing energy and with all the rapid movement of the aurora itwas mysterious that there should be absolutely no sound. The auroraoften looks as if it _ought_ to swish, but to his ears it has never doneit; so much phosphorescent light might naturally be accompanied by somechemical odour, but to his nostrils never has been.Queer, uncertain noises in the silence of an arctic night there oftenare--noises of crackling twigs, perhaps, noises of settling snow, noisesin the ice itself--but they are to be heard when there is no aurora aswell as when there is. It is rare to stand on the banks of the Yukon ona cold night and not hear some faint crepitating sounds, sometimesrunning back and forth across the frozen river, sometimes resembling thering of distant skates. Without offering any pronouncement upon what isa very interesting question, it seems to the writer possible that, to anear intently listening, some such noise coinciding with a decidedmovement of a great auroral streamer might seem to be caused by themovement it happened to accompany.CHAPTER XIVTHE ALASKAN DOGS[Sidenote: MALAMUTE, HUSKY, AND SIWASH]THERE are two breeds of native dogs in Alaska, and a third that isusually spoken of as such. The malamute is the Esquimau dog; and whatfor want of a better name is called the "Siwash" is the Indian dog. Manyyears ago the Hudson Bay voyageurs bred some selected strains ofimported dog with the Indian dogs of those parts, or else did no morethan carefully select the best individuals of the native species andbred from them exclusively--it is variously stated--and that is theaccepted origin of the "husky." The malamute and the husky are the twochief sources of the white man's dog teams, though cross-breeding withsetters and pointers, hounds of various sorts, mastiffs, Saint Bernards,and Newfoundlands has resulted in a general admixture of breeds, so thatthe work dogs of Alaska are an heterogeneous lot to-day. It should alsobe stated that the terms "malamute" and "husky" are very generallyconfused and often used interchangeably.The malamute, the Alaskan Esquimau dog, is precisely the same dog asthat found amongst the natives of Baffin's Bay and Greenland. KnudRasmunsen and Amundsen together have established the oneness of theEsquimaux from the east coast of Greenland all round to Saint Michael;they are one people, speaking virtually one language. And the malamutedog is one dog. A photograph that Admiral Peary prints of one of theSmith Sound dogs that pulled his sled to the North Pole would pass for aphotograph of one of the present writer's team, bred on the KoyukukRiver, the parents coming from Kotzebue Sound.There was never animal better adapted to environment than the malamutedog. His coat, while it is not fluffy, nor the hair long, is yet sodense and heavy that it affords him a perfect protection against theutmost severity of cold. His feet are tough and clean, and do notreadily accumulate snow between the toes and therefore do not easily getsore--which is the great drawback of nearly all "outside" dogs and theirmixed progeny. He is hardy and thrifty and does well on less food thanthe mixed breeds; and, despite Peary to the contrary, he will eatanything. "He will not eat anything but meat," says Peary; "I have triedand I know." No dog accustomed to a flesh diet willingly leaves it forother food; the dog is a carnivorous animal. But hunger will whet hisappetite for anything that his bowels can digest. "Muk," the counterpartof Peary's "King Malamute," has thriven for years on his daily ration ofdried fish, tallow, and rice, and eats biscuits and doughnuts wheneverhe can get them. The malamute is affectionate and faithful and likes tobe made a pet of, but he is very jealous and an incorrigible fighter. Hehas little of the fawning submissiveness of pet dogs "outside," but isindependent and self-willed and apt to make a troublesome pet. However,pets that give little trouble seldom give much pleasure.His comparative shortness of leg makes him somewhat better adapted tothe hard, crusted snow of the coast than to the soft snow of theinterior, but he is a ceaseless and tireless worker who loves to pull.His prick ears, always erect, his bushy, graceful tail, carried highunless it curl upon the back as is the case with some, his compact coatof silver-grey, his sharp muzzle and black nose and quick narrow eyesgive him an air of keenness and alertness that marks him out amongstdogs. When he is in good condition and his coat is taken care of he is ahandsome fellow, and he will weigh from seventy-five to eighty-five orninety pounds.The husky is a long, rangy dog, with more body and longer legs than themalamute and with a shorter coat. The coat is very thick and dense,however, and furnishes a sufficient protection. A good, spirited huskywill carry his tail erect like a malamute, but the ears are notpermanently pricked up; they are mobile. He is, perhaps, the generalpreference amongst dog drivers in the interior, but he has not thegraceful distinction of appearance of the malamute.The "Siwash" dog is the common Indian dog; generally undersized, uncaredfor, half starved most of the time, and snappish because not handledsave with roughness. In general appearance he resembles somewhat a smallmalamute, though, indeed, nowadays so mixed have breeds become that hemay be any cur or mongrel. He is a wonderful little worker, and theloads he will pull are astonishing. Sometimes, with it all, he is anattractive-looking fellow, especially when there has been a good mooseor caribou killing and he has gorged upon the refuse and put some fleshupon his bones. And if one will take a little trouble to make friendswith him he likes petting as much as any dog. Most Indian dogs "don'tsabe white man," and will snap at one's first advances. On the whole, itis far better to let them alone; for, encouraged at all, they areterrible thieves--what hungry creatures are not?--and make all sorts oftrouble with one's own team. The pure malamute and the pure husky do notbark at all, they howl; barking is a sure sign of an admixture of otherstrains.[Sidenote: DOG BREEDING]Here it may be worth while to say a few words about the general beliefthat dogs in Alaska are interbred with wolves. That the dog and the wolfhave a common origin there can be no doubt, and that they willinterbreed is equally sure, but diligent inquiry on the part of thewriter for a number of years, throughout all interior Alaska, amongstwhites and natives, has failed to educe one authentic instance ofintentional interbreeding, has failed to discover one man who knows ofhis own knowledge that any living dog is the offspring of such union.While, therefore, it is not here stated that such cross-breeding has nottaken place, or even that it does not take place, yet the author issatisfied that it is a very rare thing, indeed, and that the commonstories of dogs that are "half wolf" are fabulous.Indeed, it seems a rare thing when any sort of pains is taken about thebreeding of dogs. In a country where dogs are so important, where theyare indispensable for any sort of travel during six or seven months inthe year over by far the greater portion of it, one would expect thatmuch attention would be paid to dog breeding; but this is not the case.Here and there a man who takes pride in a team will carefully mate thebest available couple and carefully rear their offspring, but for themost part breeding seems left to chance. A team all of malamutes or allof huskies, a matched team of any sort, is the exception, and excitesinterest and remark.The market for dogs is so uncertain that it is doubtful if there wouldbe any money in scientific breeding for the trail. When a stampede tonew diggings takes place, the price of dogs rises enormously. Any sortof good dog on the spot may be worth a hundred dollars, or a hundred andfifty, and the man with a kennel would make a small fortune out of hand.But at other times it is hard to get twenty-five dollars for the best ofdogs.The cost of maintenance of a dog team is considerable. When themail-routes went all down the Yukon, and dogs were used exclusively, thecontracting company estimated that it cost seventy-five dollars per headper annum to feed its dogs; while to the traveller in remote regions,buying dog feed in small parcels here and there, the cost is not lessthan one hundred dollars per head. Of course, a man engaged in dograising would have his own fish-wheel on the Yukon and would catchalmost all that his dogs would eat. Fish is plentiful in Alaska; it istransportation that costs. Dogs not working can do very well onstraight dried fish, but for the working dog this ration is supplementedby rice and tallow or other cereal and fat; not only because the animaldoes better on it, but also because straight dried fish is a very bulkyfood, and weight for weight goes not nearly so far. Cooking for the dogsis troublesome, but economical of weight and bulk, and conserves thevigour of the team. In the summer-time the dogs are still an expense.They must be boarded at some fish camp, at a cost of about five dollarsper head per month.The white man found the dog team in use amongst the natives all over theinterior, but he taught the Indian how to drive dogs. The natives hadnever evolved a "leader." Some fleet stripling always ran ahead, and thedogs followed. The leader, guided by the voice, "geeing" and "hawing,"stopping and advancing at the word of command, is a white man'sinnovation, though now universally adopted by the natives. So is the dogcollar. The "Siwash harness" is simply a band that goes round theshoulders and over the breast. In the interior the universal "Siwash"hitch was tandem, and is yet, but as trails have widened and improved,more and more the tendency grows amongst white men to hitch two abreast;and the most convenient rig is a lead line to which each dog is attachedindependently by a single-tree, either two abreast, or, by adding afurther length to the lead line, one behind the other, so that on anarrow trail the tandem rig may be quickly resorted to.[Sidenote: THE DOCKING OF TAILS]One advantage of the change from single to double rig is the decay ofthe cruel custom of "bobbing" the dogs' tails. When dogs are hitchedone close behind the other (and the closer the better for pulling) thetail of the dog in front becomes heavy with ice from the condensation ofthe breath of the dog behind, until not only is he carrying weight butthe use of the tail for warmth at night is foregone. So it was theuniversal practice to cut tails short off. But sleeping out in the open,as travelling dogs often must do, in all sorts of weather, with thethermometer at 50° or 60° below zero sometimes, a thick, bushy tail is agreat protection to a dog. With it he covers nose and feet and is tuckedup snug and warm. It is the dog's natural protection for the muzzle andthe thinly haired extremities. A few years ago almost all work dogs inthe interior were bobtailed; now the plumes wave over the teams again.Five dogs are usually considered the minimum team, and seven dogs make agood team. A good, quick-travelling load for a dog team is fifty poundsto the dog, on ordinary trails. The dogs will pull as much as onehundred pounds apiece or more, but that becomes more like freightingthan travelling. On a good level trail with strong big dogs, mensometimes haul two hundred pounds to the dog. These, however, are"gee-pole propositions," in the slang of the trail, and the man is doinghard work with a band around his chest and the pole in his hand. Forquick travelling, fifty pounds to the dog is enough.The most useful "outside" strains that the white man has introduced intothe dogs of the interior are the pointer and setter and collie. Thebird-dogs themselves make very fast teams and soon adapt themselves tothe climate, but their feet will not stand the strain. The collie'sintelligence would make him a most admirable leader, did he not have sopronouncedly the faults of his good qualities; he wants to do all thework; he works himself to death. It is the leader's business to keep theteam strung out; it is not his business to pull the load. But theadmixture of these strains with the native blood has produced some veryfine dogs. The Newfoundland and Saint Bernard strains have been perhapsthe least successful admixtures. They are too heavy and cumbersome andalways have tender feet; their bodies and the bodies of their mongrelprogeny are too heavy for their feet.[Sidenote: DOG LOYALTY]The last statement, with regard to Newfoundland and Saint Bernard dogs,has an interesting exception. There is a dog, not uncommon in Alaska,that by a curious inversion of phrase is known as the "one-man-dog."What is meant is the "one-dog-man dog," the dog that belongs to the manthat uses only one dog. Many and many a prospector pulls his wholewinter grub-stake a hundred miles or more into the hills with the aid ofone dog. His progress is slow, in bad places or on up grades he mustrelay, and all the time he is doing more work than the dog is, but hemanages to get his stuff to his cabin or his camp with no other aid thanone dog can give. It is usually a large heavy dog--speed never beingasked of him, nor steady continuous winter work--often of one of thebreeds mentioned, or of its predominant strain. The companionshipbetween such a man and such a dog is very close, and the understandingcomplete. Sometimes the dog will be his master's sole society for thewhole winter.Indeed, any man of feeling who spends the winters with a dog team mustgrow to a deep sympathy with the animals, and to a keen, sometimesalmost a poignant, sense of what he owes to them. There is a mysteryabout domestic animals of whatever kind. It is a mystery that man shouldbe able to impose his will upon them, change their habits andcharacters, constrain them to his tasks, take up all their lives withunnatural toil. And that he should get affection and devotion in returnmakes the mystery yet more mysterious.The dog gets his food--often of poor quality and scant quantity--andthat is all he gets. Yet the life of a work dog that has a kind andconsiderate master is not an unhappy one. The dog is as full of thecanine joy of life as though he had never worn a collar, and not onlysports and gambols when free, but really seems to like his work and doit gladly. He will chafe at inaction; he will come eagerly to theharness in the morning; often will come before he is called and ask tobe harnessed; and if for any reason--lameness or galled neck or sorefeet--a dog is cut out of the team temporarily, to run loose, he willtry at every chance to get back into his place and will often attack thedog that seems to him to be occupying it; while a dog left behind willhowl most piteously and make desperate efforts to break his chain andrejoin his companions and his labour. And the wonderful and pitifulthing about it is that no sort of severity or brutality on his master'spart will destroy that zealous allegiance. The dog in Alaska isabsolutely dependent upon man for subsistence, and he seems to realiseit.There is a great deal of cruelty and brutality amongst dog drivers inAlaska. At times, it is true, most dogs need some punishment. Dogsdiffer as much as men do, and some are lazy and some are self-willed.The best of them will develop bad trail habits if they are allowedto--habits which will prove hard to break by and by and be a continualsource of delay and annoyance until broken. But a very slightpunishment, judicially administered at the moment, will usually sufficejust as well as a severe one, and the main source of brutality in thepunishment of dogs is sheer bad temper on the part of the driver, andhas for its only possible end, not the correction of the animal's faultbut the satisfaction of its owner's rage. To see some hulking,passionate brute lashing a poor little dog with a chain, or beating himwith a club; to see dogs overworked to utter exhaustion and theirlagging steps still hastened by a rain of blows, these are the sickeningsights of the trail--and they are not uncommon. The language of most dogdrivers to their dogs consists of a mixture of cursing and ribaldry,excused by the statement that only by the use of such speech may dogs bedriven at all. But there is little point in the excuse; such speech is,to an extent not far from universal, the speech of the country. Swedeswho have little and Indians who have none other English will yet bevolubly profane and obscene; in the latter case often with completeignorance of the meaning of the terms. Yet it must be recorded notungratefully by the impartial observer that the rare presence of adecent woman or a clergyman will almost always put a check uponblackguardly speech, even that of a dog driver; women and clergymenbeing supposed the only two classes who could have any possibleobjection to foulness of mouth. To refer continually to the excrementsof the body, to sexual commerce, natural and unnatural, all in thegrossest terms, and to mix these matters intimately with the sacrednames, is "manly" speech amongst a large part of the population ofAlaska.       *       *       *       *       *[Sidenote: REINDEER][Sidenote: REINDEER AS DRAUGHT ANIMALS]It has been claimed with justice that the introduction of the reindeerinto Alaska has been highly successful; yet there is much misconceptionamongst people "outside" as to the nature of that success. Stimulated bythe example of the United States Government, and urged thereto by DoctorWilfred Grenfell and others, the Canadian Government is now introducingreindeer into Labrador; and the distinguished missionary physician,whose recent decoration gives lustre to the royal bestower as well as tothe recipient, has publicly announced his hope that these domesticatedherbivora will "eliminate that scourge of the country, the husky dog."To announce such a hope, based upon any results in Alaska, is toannounce misconception of the nature of the success which has attendedDoctor Sheldon Jackson's "reindeer experiment." There is not a dog theless in Alaska because of the reindeer, nor ever will be; in so far assimilarity of conditions warrant us in expecting similar results, it issafe to predict that the reindeer will never "eliminate the husky dog"in Labrador.But before discussing the success of the reindeer experiment and itslack of any bearing upon the number or the usefulness of the dog, thewriter would pause to take strong exception to the description of thehusky dog as the "scourge" of Labrador, and would insist that any suchwholesale condemnation is a boomerang that returns upon the head of theLabradorian who uses it. For, as the dog is one of the most adaptable ofall domestic animals, and is, to an amazing extent, what his mastermakes him, to bring a railing accusation against the whole race of dogsis in reality to accuse those who breed and rear them.Why should the dog have richly earned the gratitude and affection of allthe world except Labrador? Why should he be called the "Friend of Man"everywhere except amongst these particular people? Far to the north ofthem the Esquimaux prize and cherish their dogs. Throughout the wholewide region to the west and northwest of them the dog is man'sindispensable ally and faithful servant. The same husky dog has madegood his claim upon man in Alaska. It is he and his brother, themalamute, that have opened up Alaska so far as it has been opened;without whom to-day the development of the country would suddenly cease.And to the question that is often asked "outside," as to whether theAlaskan dog is not a savage beast, it is justly replied: "Not unless hehappens to belong to a savage beast." Is it really otherwise anywhere?Instead of the reindeer eliminating the dog, there is far greaterlikelihood of the dog eliminating the reindeer; and the professed doglover, indignant at the opprobrious term applied to a whole race ofdogs, may be disposed to echo Lady Macbeth's wish: "May good digestionwait on appetite."So far as substituting another draught animal for the dog is concerned,if the whole equine tribe, even down to Manchurian ponies should forsome strange reason be out of the question, the Canadian Government hadbetter import the polar ox or the yak. It is only amongst a nomadicpeople, whose main quest is pasturage, that the reindeer is asatisfactory draught animal. When introduced into Alaska there wasdoubtless expectation that he would be generally useful in thiscapacity. For a while certain mail-routes on the Seward Peninsula wereserved by him, and here and there a deluded prospector put hisgrub-stake on a reindeer sled. It is safe to say that no reindeer are soemployed to-day. They were soon abandoned on the mail trails, and theprospector, after one season's experience, slaughtered his reindeer andtraded its meat and hide for a couple of dogs.Consider that the reindeer feeds upon one thing alone, the moss that isnamed after him, and that while this moss is very widely distributedindeed, throughout Alaska, it is not found at all in the river valleysor the forests, but only upon the treeless hills at considerableelevation. Now the rivers are the highways. It is on their frozensurface, or on "portage" trails through the woods, that the greater partof all travelling is done and, in particular, that established routes ofregular communication are maintained. To leave the trail after a day'sjourney, to wander miles into the hills, to herd the deer while theybrowse from slope to slope, digging the snow away in search of theirprovender, is wholly incompatible with any sustained or regular travel.The reindeer is a timid and almost defenceless creature. Wolves andlynxes prey upon him. One lynx is thought to have killed upward oftwenty head in one season out of the herd that was stationed at Tanana,leaping upon the backs of the creatures, cutting their throats, suckingtheir blood, and riding them until they dropped and died. A few dogswill soon work havoc in a herd. So the reindeer must be constantlyprotected and at the same time must have range over a considerable scopeof country. The care of reindeer is a business in itself, not a meredetail of the business of transportation or travel.[Sidenote: DOG FOOD]On the other hand, the dog's ration for many days is carried on the sledhe hauls. There is a definite limit to it, of course, and knowledge ofthis limit made every experienced dog driver incredulous, from thefirst, of Doctor Cook's claim to have travelled some eleven hundredmiles, from Etah to the North Pole and back, with a team of dogs haulingtheir own food. It is possible, however, on fair trails, with rigideconomy, to travel five hundred miles and haul dog food and man food andthe other indispensables of a long journey; and that is twice as far asit is ever necessary to travel in the interior of Alaska withoutreaching a supply point, the northern slope to the Arctic Oceanexcepted.Perhaps it would be putting it better to say that a team of seven dogscan haul their own and their driver's food and the camp equipment, all,of course, carefully reduced to a minimum, for a month. Dog food of onesort or another can be bought at any place where anything whatever issold. Almost any Indian village will furnish dried fish, and it is oftenpossible, with no other weapon than a .22 rifle, to feed dogs largely onthe country through which they pass. The writer's team has had many ameal of ptarmigan, rabbits, quail, and spruce hen, while to enumerateother articles, on which at times and in stress for proper food, hisdogs have sustained life and strength for travel, would be to enumerateall the common human comestibles. Aside from the usual ration of fish,tallow, and rice boiled together, corn-meal, beans, flour, oatmeal, sago(though that is poor stuff), tapioca, canned meats of all kinds, cannedsalmon, even canned kippered herring from Scotland, seal oil, seal andwhale flesh, ham and bacon, horse flesh, moose and caribou andmountain-sheep flesh, canned "Boston brown bread," canned butter, cannedmilk, dried apples, sugar, cheese, crackers of all kinds, and a score ofother matters have at times entered into their food. Dogs have been"tided over" tight places for days and days on horse oats boiled withtallow candles, working the while. Anything that a man can eat, and muchthat even a starving man would scarcely eat, will make food for dogs. Atthe last and worst, dog can be fed to dog and even to man. When a dogteam reaches a mining camp where supplies of all sorts are scarce--andthat is not an uncommon experience--it is sometimes an exceedinglyexpensive matter to feed it; but something can always be found thatwill serve to keep it going until the return to a better-stocked region.In the winter of 1910-11, when there was such scarcity in the Iditarod,it cost the writer thirty-nine dollars and fifty cents to feed sevendogs for a week, and he has more than once been at almost a similarcharge in the Koyukuk. But in all his travels he has never yet beenunable to procure some sort of food for his dogs. At times they havebeen fed for days on rabbits straight; at times on ptarmigan straight.[Sidenote: THE REINDEER'S USEFULNESS]Speaking broadly, the reindeer is a stupid, unwieldy, and intractablebrute, not comparing for a moment with the dog in intelligence oradaptability. The common notion that his name is derived from the use ofreins in driving him, thus putting him in the class with the horse, is amistake; the word comes from a Norse root which refers to hismoss-browsing habit. The "rein" with which he is driven is a rope tiedaround one of his horns. He has no cognisance of "gee" and "haw," nor ofany other vocal direction, but must be yanked hither and thither withthe rope by main force; while to stop him in his mad career, once he isstarted, it is often necessary to throw him with the rope. In Laplandthere are doubtless individual deer better trained; the Lap herders tellof them with pride; but in the main this is a just description ofreindeer handling. All the chief herders in Alaska are Laps, broughtover for their knowledge of the animals, and the writer has repeatedlyridden behind some of their best deer.Wherein, then, lies the success of the reindeer experiment in Alaska?Chiefly in the provision of a regular meat supply by which the nativesand whites in the vicinity of a herd are relieved from theprecariousness of the chase or the rapacity of the cold-storage butchercompany. The Esquimau, having served his allotted apprenticeship of fiveyears and entered upon possession of a herd, can at any time kill anddress a "kid of the flock" for his family or for the market. The priceof butcher's meat has been kept down all over the Seward Peninsula bythe competition of the numerous reindeer herds, to the comfort of thepopulation and the exasperation of the butcher company, and many anEsquimau has become passably rich. The skin of the animal also furnishesa warm and much-needed material for clothing and finds a ready sale at agood price.This success is, however, confined so far to the coast. The herds havenot thriven in the interior and have now all been withdrawn to thecoast. Beasts of prey killed them; a hoof disease destroyed many; othersare supposed to have died from eating some poisonous fungus. In five orsix years the herd at Tanana had not increased at all, but ratherdiminished, and the same is true of the other herds on the Yukon. TheIndian, moreover, does not take to herding as the Esquimau does, and canhardly be induced to the segregation of himself and his family from histribe which reindeer herding involves. The "apprentices" on the Yukonwere nearly all of them Esquimaux from the coast.It may be that the salt of the coast region is essential to thewell-being of the reindeer; it is not so with the caribou--and thereindeer is nothing but a domesticated caribou--many herds of which, inthe interior of Alaska, never visit the coast at all; but all caribouherds have their salt-licks, and one wishes that the oft-recommendedplan of furnishing salt for the herds in the interior had been adoptedby the government for a season before their removal was determined upon.Like most other "resources" of Alaska, the imported reindeer, at firstdecried and ridiculed, has now become the slender foundation forextravagant speculations of prosperity. The "millions of acres waitingfor the plough" in the interior have lately been supplemented in thisvisionary treasury by the capitalisation of the vast tundras of thecoast, the golden wheat-fields of the one finding counterpart in themultitudinous herds of the other. The growing dearth of cattle-range inthe United States offers, it seems, to Alaska the opportunity ofsupplying the American market with meat, and the kindling fancy of theenthusiastic "booster" sees trains loaded with frozen reindeer meatrolling into Chicago.While the reindeer will never supersede the dog as a draught animalanywhere, the horse is rapidly superseding him on good trails in themore settled and peopled regions. In the Fairbanks and Nome districts,in the Circle and Koyukuk districts, in the Fortymile and in theIditarod--in all districts where any extensive mining is carriedon--heavy freights are moved by horses, and this tendency will doubtlessincrease rather than diminish. The dog team cannot compete with thehorse team when it comes to moving heavy loads over good trails. Thegrain that the horse eats is imported, and in the main will probablyalways be imported, but oats cut green and properly cared for makeexcellent fodder, and the native hay, while not nearly as nutritious asthe imported timothy, will sufficiently supplement grain.We hear a great deal nowadays of the benefits which are to come toAlaska from the railroad which the United States is expected to buildfrom tide-water to the Yukon, and the clamorous voices of the journalistand the professional promoter and politician, which seem the only voiceswhich ever reach the ear of government, are insistent that this is theone great thing that will bring prosperity to the country. Yet thewriter is confident that he expresses almost the unanimous opinion ofthose who live in the country, outside of the classes mentioned, when hesays that if the amount of money which this railroad will cost wereexpended upon good highways and trails the benefit would be muchgreater. It is means of intercommunication between the various parts ofthe country that is the great need of Alaska; some of its most promisingsections are almost inaccessible now or accessible only at great troubleand expense. Access to the country itself, for the introduction ofmerchandise, is furnished easily enough during three or four months ofthe year by its incomparable system of waterways. Good highways, wellengineered and well maintained, over which horse teams could be usedsummer and winter, would remove much of what at present is the almostprohibitive cost of distributing that merchandise from river points.Such roads would give an enormous stimulus to prospecting, and wouldrender it possible to work gold placers all over the country that are oftoo low grade to be worked at the present rates of transportation. A_really_ good highway from Valdez to Fairbanks and the making of thelong-ago begun Valdez-Eagle road; a good highway from Fairbanks to theupper Tanana as far as the Nabesna, connecting with the one from theCopper River country and the coast; another from the Yukon into theKoyukuk and the Chandalar; another from Fairbanks into the Kantishna,connecting with one from the lower Kuskokwim and one from the Iditarod;a road from Eagle across the almost unknown region (save for the line ofthe 141st meridian) between the Yukon and the Porcupine Rivers; two orthree roads between the Yukon and the Tanana; a road from the Koyukuk toKotzebue Sound--these would constitute main arteries of travel and wouldopen up the country as no trunk railroad will ever do. The expense wouldbe great, both of construction and maintenance, but it would probablynot be greater than the cost of constructing and maintaining theproposed railroad. Twenty or thirty ordinary freight trains a year wouldbring in all the goods that Alaska consumes. Before that amount can bevery greatly increased there must be a large development of the means bywhich it is to be distributed throughout the country.Some day, perhaps, these roads will be made, and the horse, not the dog,will be the draught animal upon them. Yet it would be a rash conclusionthat even then the time will be at hand when there will be no longeruse for the work dog in Alaska. Away from these main arteries of travelhe will still be employed. So long as great part of the land remains anoble arctic wilderness; so long as the prospector strikes farther andfarther into the rugged mountains; so long as quick travel over greatstretches of country is necessary or desirable; so long as the salmonswarm up the rivers to furnish food for the catching; so long as theIndian moves from fishing camp to village and from village to huntingcamp--so long will the dog be hitched to the sled in Alaska; so longwill his joyful yelp and his plaintive whine be heard in the land; solong will his warm tongue seek his master's hand, even the hand thatstrikes him, and his eloquent eyes speak his utter allegiance.INDEXINDEX  Agriculture, 228, 229, 230, 231, 367  Alarm-clocks, 304  Alatna River, 70  Albert the pilot, 60  Allakaket, 190-195  Alphabet, 69  Amundsen, 292, 392  Animals, wild, 257, 276, 277, 298, 405  Anthropologists, 270  Arctic Ocean, 97, 98  Army posts: economic value, 151    discipline and life, 217    frequent changes, 217    surgeons, 218  Arthur, 158, 163  Athabascan language, 349  Atler, 170, 171  Auroras, 46, 380-391  Baker Creek Springs, 155  Bathing, 85  Beaver City, 345  Bering Sea, 129  Betticher, C.
