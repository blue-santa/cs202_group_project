vancouver island skulls : dagegen sehen wir dieselbe alveolare hyperostose die wir bei den leuten von s

von erheblicher beweiskraft kÃ¶nnen eigenthÃ¼mlichkeiten und abnormitÃ¤ten des knochengewebes der knochenoberflÃ¤che werden wenn dieselben bei sich grosser seltenheit ihres vorkommens einem oberschÃ¤del und unterkiefer zugleich vorkommen 
fand ich unterkiefer der gypsabgÃ¼sse des sogenannten schillerschÃ¤dels sehr merkwÃ¼rdige bis dahin nirgends erwÃ¤hnte erbsenfÃ¶rmige exostosen den alveolen der eck und schneidezÃ¤hne 
ganz Ã¤hnliche wenn auch etwas flÃ¤chere exostosen zeigen die alveolen eben derselben zÃ¤hne des oberschÃ¤dels und es beweist dieses seltene vorkommen bei dem zutreffen aller Ã¼brigen zeichen das zusammengehÃ¶ren beider stÃ¼cke mit hoher sicherheit 
einer etwas anderen form der dieselben einen geschlossenen exostotischen saum bilden fand ich alveolarexostosen bei einem lettenschÃ¤del ( g 
gandras 47 j halle nr

hier sind die alveolarrÃ¤nder der schneide und eckzÃ¤hne mit flachen oberkiefer streifenfÃ¶rmigen ( senkrecht gestellten ) unterkiefer mehr rundlichen exostosen besetzt dass der sonst papierdÃ¼nne zahnflÃ¤chenrand beider kiefer einen die zahnhÃ¤lse begrenzenden wulst fÃ¶rmigen saum umgewandelt ist 
der gleiche charakter dieser nicht hÃ¤ufigen abnormitÃ¤t beiden kiefern giebt die vollste ueberzeungung der zusammengehÃ¶rigkeit

kuhl 1876 : [ 220 ] bilden die eskimo der sprache das bindeglied zwischen america und asien ist dies noch viel mehr der fall bezug auf ihren typus : dieser stimmt bei den polarvÃ¶lkern diesseits und jenseits der beringsstrasse zum verwechseln Ã¼berein wie denn auch ein bestÃ¤ndiger verkehr hinÃ¼ber und herÃ¼ber stattfindet 
hierin liegt der unwiderstehliche beweis dass diese polarvÃ¶lker wenigstens von einer herkunft sind und dass eine einwanderung von einem continente das andere hier stattgefunden hat 
haben wir nun die wahl entweder die eskimo aus asien nach america oder die tschuktschen die dort auf der asiatischen seite wohnen aus america einwandern zu lassen wofÃ¼r sich auch stimmen erhoben haben werden wir keinen augenblick zweifelhaft sein : eine spÃ¤tere rÃ¼ckwanderung eines einzelnen stammes das land der vÃ¤ter wÃ¤re immerhin denkbar ; aber wer Ã¼ber die tschuktschen hinweg die sache in's grosse sieht kann fÃ¼r die urzeit nur eine einwanderung von asien nach america nicht umgekehrt annehmen und hierfÃ¼r finden wir ausser den allgemeinen grÃ¼nden welche uns der verlauf unserer untersuchungen nahe gebracht noch zwei besondere beweise bei den eskimo : einmal kÃ¶nnen wir die spur ihrer wanderungen historisch verfolgen und diese wÃ¤ren nach osten gerichtet sodass sie grÃ¶nland mit dem heute ihr name eng verbunden ist zuletzt erreichten ( s 209 ) ; sodann haben die eskimo allein unter den americanischen stÃ¤mmen das mongolische geprÃ¤ge ganz unversehrt bewahrt dies bliebe unerklÃ¤rlich wenn sie americanische autochthonen wÃ¤ren einen deutlichen hinweis auf die urheimath asien enthalten auch die wanderungen der stÃ¤mme durch das americanische continent soweit wir dieselben verfolgen kÃ¶nnen

rink 1890 : [ 233 ] kann es wohl keinem zweifel unterworfen sein dass die eskimos den sogenannten nordwest indianern der kÃ¼ste alaskas und weiter sÃ¼dwÃ¤rts nÃ¤chsten stehen 
es dÃ¼rfte deshalb der untersuchung werth sein ob sie nicht auch wirklich als das Ã¤usserste nÃ¶rdliche glied dieser vÃ¶lkerstÃ¤mme zu betrachten wÃ¤ren 
man hat angenommen dass diese letzteren dem laufe der flÃ¼sse folgend vom binnenlande zur kÃ¼ste gekommen sind 
sie lernten dann theilweise und um mehr wohl je weiter nach norden sich ihren lebensunterhalt aus dem meere zu verschaffen 
die eskimos endigten damit sich ausschliesslich der jagd auf dem meere zu widmen und erlangten dadurch ihre merkwÃ¼rdige fÃ¤higkeit allen hindernissen des arktischen klimas trotz bieten zu kÃ¶nnen 
betrachten wir demnach wie man vermeintlich noch jetzt die spuren der verÃ¤nderungen beobachten kann denen sie nach und nach unterworfen worden sind indem sie sich unserer vermuthung zufolge nach norden und osten verbreiteten

rink 1886 : [ 237 ] grÃ¶nland kann ja nur von westen seine eskimoische bevÃ¶lkerung empfangen haben 
dasselbe lÃ¤sst sich mit wahrscheinlichkeit auch von den nÃ¤chsten nachbarlÃ¤ndern jenseits der davisstrasse annehmen und wenn wir diese vermutung weiter erstrecken gelangen wir zum alaskaterritorium als der wahrscheinlichen heimat der jetzt weit zertreuten arktischen volkes 
zunÃ¤chst findet diese annahme eine bestÃ¤tigung darin dass die eskimos hier nicht auf die kÃ¼ste beschrÃ¤nkt sondern auch lÃ¤ngs der flÃ¼sse ins binnenland verbreitet sind nur dass der ungeheure fischreichtum dieser flÃ¼sse es mÃ¶glich gemacht haben kann dass hier ursprÃ¼nglich eine noch viel grÃ¶ssere bevÃ¶lkerung als jetzt sich sammelte welche durch auswanderung das notwendige kontingent zur entstehung der auf die meereskÃ¼ste beschrÃ¤nkten stÃ¤mme geliefert haben kann 
wilson 1876 : [ 238 ] analogies confirm probability portion north american stock having entered continent asia bering strait aleutian islands ; probably former 
direction north american germ population entered continent asia diffused northwest ultimately reached valleys mississippi penetrated southern latitudes route east rocky mountains 
centuries intervened immigration coming contact races southern continent ; philological evidence indicates northwestern immigration demonstrable ancient date 
able study evidence adduced appears point way 
asiatic esquimaux distributed coast adjacent dividing sea ; islands aleutian group occupation remarkable stock common hemispheres : clearly recognizable indications current migration setting continent asia full influence prove comprehensive imagined possible 
grote 1877 : [ 239 ] regards eskimo original inhabitants north america believes extended 50 Â° eastern 60 Â° western part continent 
krause 1883 : [ 240 ] ueberblickt man nun die gegenwÃ¤rtige verbreitung der eskimos asien wird man der ansicht von dall und nordenskiÃ¶ld beistimmen dass die asiatischen eskimo aus amerika eingewandert sind und nicht wie steller wrangell und andere vermutheten zurÃ¼ckgebliebene reste einer ehemals zahlreicheren nach amerika hinÃ¼bergezogenen bevÃ¶lkerung 
immerhin wÃ¼rde durch die annahme eines amerikanischen ursprunges der jetzigen eskimobevÃ¶lkerung die mÃ¶glichkeit frÃ¼herer wanderungen entgegengesetzter richtung nicht ausgeschlossen sein nur giebt die gegenwÃ¤rtige verbreitung keinen anhalt fÃ¼r eine solche und historische beweise fÃ¤hlen

virchow 1877 : [ 244 ] ich mÃ¶chte namentlich darauf aufmerksam machen dass diejenigen welche den nÃ¤chsten anknÃ¼pfungspunkt fÃ¼r die urbevÃ¶lkerung amerika's bei den eskimo's suchen welche ferner die sprache und die formen der eskimo's nach asien hinein verfolgen leicht ein petitio principii machen dÃ¼rften insofern als es wohl sein kÃ¶nnte dass sie ein spÃ¤teres phÃ¤nomen fÃ¼r ein frÃ¼heres halten 
warum sollte nicht die einwanderung der eskimo's von asien erst erfolgt sein nachdem lÃ¤ngst andere theile des continents ihre bewohner erhalten hatten 
1878 : [ 245 ] nun ist es sehr bemerkenswerth dass gegenÃ¼ber dieser physiognomischen aehnlichkeit der eskimos und der mongolen eine absolute differenze zwischen ihnen bezug auf die schÃ¤delkapsel existirt ( examined six living greenland eskimos ) 
1885 : [ 246 ] verbinden wir dieses mit dem umstande dass die sagen der ungava eskimos stets nach norden Ã¼ber die hudson strasse verlegt werden dass man im baffin lande stets Ã¼ber die fury und hecla strasse fort nach sÃ¼den als dem schauplatz alter sagen hinweist und dass die westlichen eskimos ebenso den osten als das land ihrer sagenhaften helden und stÃ¤mme betrachten gewinnt die vermuthung wahrscheinlichkeit dass im westen des hudson bay gebietes die heimath der weitverbreiteten stÃ¤mme zu suchen ist

mortillet 1889 : [ 258 ] les groÃ«nlandais au point de vue palÃ©oethnologique prÃ©sentent un trÃ¨s grand intÃ©rÃªt 
ils paraissent se relier trÃ¨s intimement aux hommes qui habitaient l'europe moyenne pendant l'Ã©poque de la madeleine 
ils seraient les descendants directs des magdalÃ¨niens 
ils auraient successivement Ã©migrÃ© vers le pÃ´le avec l'animal caractÃ©ristique de cette Ã©poque le renne 
habituÃ©s aux froids les plus rigoureux de l'Ã©poque magdalÃ©nienne ils se sont retirÃ©s dans les rÃ©gions froides du nord 
comme le voit il y la plus grande ressemblance tant sous le rapport physique moral que sous le rapport artistique industriel entre les hommes de la madeleine les groÃ«nlandais 
cette ressemblance est telle que nous pouvons en conclure que les seconds sont les descendants des premiers 
testut 1889 : [ 259 ] parmi les races actuelles celle qui parait prÃ©senter la plus grande analogie avec l'homme de chancelade est celle des esquimaux qui vivent encore Ã  l'Ã©tat sauvage dans leg glaces de l'amÃ©rique septentrionale 
ils ont en effet le mÃªme crÃ¢ne que notre troglodyte quaternaire ; leur face est constituÃ©e suivant le mÃªme type ; ils ont Ã  peu de chose prÃ¨s la mÃªme taille le mÃªme indice palatin le mÃªme indice nasal le mÃªme indice orbitaire le mÃªme degrÃ© de torsion de l'humÃ©rus 
la dÃ©couverte de chancelade en mettant en lumiÃ¨re une analogie frappante entre le squelette de notre troglodyte pÃ©rigourdin celui des esquimaux actuels apporte Ã  cette opinion aussi sÃ©duisante que naturelle l'appui de l'anthropologie anatomique qui dans l'espÃ¨ce une importance capitale 
elle lui est de tous points favorable Ã©lÃ¨ve Ã  la hauteur d'une vÃ©ritÃ© probable je n'ose dire d'une vÃ©ritÃ© dÃ©montrÃ©e ce qui n'Ã©tait encore qu'une simple hypothÃ¨se 
hervÃ© 1893 : [ 260 ] par leurs usages par leurs moeurs aussi bien que par leur matÃ©riel industriel artistique les hyperborÃ©ens actuels ( tchouktches eskimaux ) sont extrÃªmement voisins des troglodytes magdalÃ©niens de l'europe occidentale ; Ã  ce point que hamy pu dire qu'ils continuent de nos jours dan les rÃ©gions circumpolaires l'Ã¢ge du renne de france de belgique de suisse avec ses caractÃ©ristiques zoologiques ethnographiques ( op cit 366 ) 
nous avons vu d'autre part que les plus purs d'entre eux ne diffÃ¨rent pas anatomiquement des magdalÃ©niens 
c'est donc au rameau hyperborÃ©en que nous sommes amenÃ©s Ã  rattacher au point de vue ethnique les derniÃ¨res populations de l'europe quaternaire 
boule 1913 : [ 261 ] sait d'ailleurs depuis les travaux de testut sur l'homme de chancelade que les relations des esquimaux sont avec d'autres hommes fossiles de nos pays mais d'un Ã¢ge gÃ©ologique plus rÃ©cent
