barbara besteht eine höchst eigenthümliche und seltene knollige hyperostosis s 
osteosclerosis alveolaris wie ich sie gleicher stärke früher nur bei eskimos gesehen hatte 
ein leichter ansatz dazu zeigt sich auch bei dem männlichen schädel nr 4 von s 
cruz 
es dürfte dieser zustand der mit tiefer abnutzung der zähne zusammenfält durch besonders reizende nahrung bedingt sein 
vancouver island skulls : dagegen sehen wir dieselbe alveolare hyperostose die wir bei den leuten von s 
barbara und weiterhin bei eskimos kennen gelernt haben 
virchow [ 182 ] 1892 : der alveolarrand gleichfalls mit hyperostotischen wülsten besetzt jedoch mehr der inneren seite besonders stark der gegend prümolares und canini weniger stark der gegend der incisici 
welcker [ 183 ] 1902 : exostosen der alveolarränder 
von erheblicher beweiskraft können eigenthümlichkeiten und abnormitäten des knochengewebes der knochenoberfläche werden wenn dieselben bei sich grosser seltenheit ihres vorkommens einem oberschädel und unterkiefer zugleich vorkommen 
fand ich unterkiefer der gypsabgüsse des sogenannten schillerschädels sehr merkwürdige bis dahin nirgends erwähnte erbsenförmige exostosen den alveolen der eck und schneidezähne 
ganz ähnliche wenn auch etwas flächere exostosen zeigen die alveolen eben derselben zähne des oberschädels und es beweist dieses seltene vorkommen bei dem zutreffen aller übrigen zeichen das zusammengehören beider stücke mit hoher sicherheit 
einer etwas anderen form der dieselben einen geschlossenen exostotischen saum bilden fand ich alveolarexostosen bei einem lettenschädel ( g 
gandras 47 j halle nr 
52 ) 
hier sind die alveolarränder der schneide und eckzähne mit flachen oberkiefer streifenförmigen ( senkrecht gestellten ) unterkiefer mehr rundlichen exostosen besetzt dass der sonst papierdünne zahnflächenrand beider kiefer einen die zahnhälse begrenzenden wulst förmigen saum umgewandelt ist 
der gleiche charakter dieser nicht häufigen abnormität beiden kiefern giebt die vollste ueberzeungung der zusammengehörigkeit 
schwächerem grade zeigt diesen zustand ein chinesenschädel der halle'schen sammlung ( lie assie ) 
fürst [ 184 ] 1908 : wir haben hier auf diese interessante anatomische bildung aufmerksam machen wollen die wenn nicht konstant doch sehr hohem prozentsatze und bestimmter charakteristischer form bei den eskimos auftritt und verschiedenen variationen auf dem unterkiefer anderer rassen speziell nordischer oder arktischer vorkommt wir wollen später eine ausführlichere beschreibung über den torus mandibularis mitteilen 
gorjanovič kramberger [ 185 ] 1909 : durch die ausbiegung der seitlichen kieferflächen würde ferner die druckrichtung der m und p eine gegen die innere kieferwandung gerichtete 
als direkte folge dieses druckes hat man die starke ausladung der entsprechenden lingualen kieferseiten im bereiche der p und m anzusehen die da eine auffallende einengung des inneren unterkieferraumes bewerkstelligte

kuhl 1876 : [ 220 ] bilden die eskimo der sprache das bindeglied zwischen america und asien ist dies noch viel mehr der fall bezug auf ihren typus : dieser stimmt bei den polarvölkern diesseits und jenseits der beringsstrasse zum verwechseln überein wie denn auch ein beständiger verkehr hinüber und herüber stattfindet 
hierin liegt der unwiderstehliche beweis dass diese polarvölker wenigstens von einer herkunft sind und dass eine einwanderung von einem continente das andere hier stattgefunden hat 
haben wir nun die wahl entweder die eskimo aus asien nach america oder die tschuktschen die dort auf der asiatischen seite wohnen aus america einwandern zu lassen wofür sich auch stimmen erhoben haben werden wir keinen augenblick zweifelhaft sein : eine spätere rückwanderung eines einzelnen stammes das land der väter wäre immerhin denkbar ; aber wer über die tschuktschen hinweg die sache in's grosse sieht kann für die urzeit nur eine einwanderung von asien nach america nicht umgekehrt annehmen und hierfür finden wir ausser den allgemeinen gründen welche uns der verlauf unserer untersuchungen nahe gebracht noch zwei besondere beweise bei den eskimo : einmal können wir die spur ihrer wanderungen historisch verfolgen und diese wären nach osten gerichtet sodass sie grönland mit dem heute ihr name eng verbunden ist zuletzt erreichten ( s 209 ) ; sodann haben die eskimo allein unter den americanischen stämmen das mongolische gepräge ganz unversehrt bewahrt dies bliebe unerklärlich wenn sie americanische autochthonen wären einen deutlichen hinweis auf die urheimath asien enthalten auch die wanderungen der stämme durch das americanische continent soweit wir dieselben verfolgen können

rink 1890 : [ 233 ] kann es wohl keinem zweifel unterworfen sein dass die eskimos den sogenannten nordwest indianern der küste alaskas und weiter südwärts nächsten stehen 
es dürfte deshalb der untersuchung werth sein ob sie nicht auch wirklich als das äusserste nördliche glied dieser völkerstämme zu betrachten wären 
man hat angenommen dass diese letzteren dem laufe der flüsse folgend vom binnenlande zur küste gekommen sind 
sie lernten dann theilweise und um mehr wohl je weiter nach norden sich ihren lebensunterhalt aus dem meere zu verschaffen 
die eskimos endigten damit sich ausschliesslich der jagd auf dem meere zu widmen und erlangten dadurch ihre merkwürdige fähigkeit allen hindernissen des arktischen klimas trotz bieten zu können 
betrachten wir demnach wie man vermeintlich noch jetzt die spuren der veränderungen beobachten kann denen sie nach und nach unterworfen worden sind indem sie sich unserer vermuthung zufolge nach norden und osten verbreiteten

hand probability people moved interior asia settle polar seashore time turning eskimo wholly emigrated america 
comparing eskimo neighboring nations physical complexion certainly point asiatic origin ; know latest investigations transitional link exist eskimo american nations sufficiently indicate possibility common origin continent 
rink 1875 : [ 236 ] author traveled resided greenland 20 years studied native traditions preserved collection considers eskimo deserving particular attention regard question america originally peopled 
desires draw attention ethnologists necessity explaining means mysterious early history eskimo apparently abrupt step people changed probably inland riverside inhabitants decidedly littoral people depending entirely products arctic sea ; arrives conclusion question remain doubtful dependent chiefly investigations traditions natives occupying adjacent countries judged eskimo appear wave aboriginal american race spread continent genial regions following principally rivers watercourses continually yielding pressure tribes peopled seacoast 
consider existing intercourse inhabitants sides bering strait find circumstances justify conclusion traditions greenland eskimo refer origin eskimo sledge dog training arctic wolf journeys frozen sea intercourse aboriginal eskimo asiatic coast 
rink 1886 : [ 237 ] grönland kann ja nur von westen seine eskimoische bevölkerung empfangen haben 
dasselbe lässt sich mit wahrscheinlichkeit auch von den nächsten nachbarländern jenseits der davisstrasse annehmen und wenn wir diese vermutung weiter erstrecken gelangen wir zum alaskaterritorium als der wahrscheinlichen heimat der jetzt weit zertreuten arktischen volkes 
zunächst findet diese annahme eine bestätigung darin dass die eskimos hier nicht auf die küste beschränkt sondern auch längs der flüsse ins binnenland verbreitet sind nur dass der ungeheure fischreichtum dieser flüsse es möglich gemacht haben kann dass hier ursprünglich eine noch viel grössere bevölkerung als jetzt sich sammelte welche durch auswanderung das notwendige kontingent zur entstehung der auf die meeresküste beschränkten stämme geliefert haben kann 
wilson 1876 : [ 238 ] analogies confirm probability portion north american stock having entered continent asia bering strait aleutian islands ; probably former 
direction north american germ population entered continent asia diffused northwest ultimately reached valleys mississippi penetrated southern latitudes route east rocky mountains

able study evidence adduced appears point way 
asiatic esquimaux distributed coast adjacent dividing sea ; islands aleutian group occupation remarkable stock common hemispheres : clearly recognizable indications current migration setting continent asia full influence prove comprehensive imagined possible 
grote 1877 : [ 239 ] regards eskimo original inhabitants north america believes extended 50 ° eastern 60 ° western part continent 
krause 1883 : [ 240 ] ueberblickt man nun die gegenwärtige verbreitung der eskimos asien wird man der ansicht von dall und nordenskiöld beistimmen dass die asiatischen eskimo aus amerika eingewandert sind und nicht wie steller wrangell und andere vermutheten zurückgebliebene reste einer ehemals zahlreicheren nach amerika hinübergezogenen bevölkerung 
immerhin würde durch die annahme eines amerikanischen ursprunges der jetzigen eskimobevölkerung die möglichkeit früherer wanderungen entgegengesetzter richtung nicht ausgeschlossen sein nur giebt die gegenwärtige verbreitung keinen anhalt für eine solche und historische beweise fählen

virchow 1877 : [ 244 ] ich möchte namentlich darauf aufmerksam machen dass diejenigen welche den nächsten anknüpfungspunkt für die urbevölkerung amerika's bei den eskimo's suchen welche ferner die sprache und die formen der eskimo's nach asien hinein verfolgen leicht ein petitio principii machen dürften insofern als es wohl sein könnte dass sie ein späteres phänomen für ein früheres halten 
warum sollte nicht die einwanderung der eskimo's von asien erst erfolgt sein nachdem längst andere theile des continents ihre bewohner erhalten hatten 
1878 : [ 245 ] nun ist es sehr bemerkenswerth dass gegenüber dieser physiognomischen aehnlichkeit der eskimos und der mongolen eine absolute differenze zwischen ihnen bezug auf die schädelkapsel existirt ( examined six living greenland eskimos ) 
1885 : [ 246 ] verbinden wir dieses mit dem umstande dass die sagen der ungava eskimos stets nach norden über die hudson strasse verlegt werden dass man im baffin lande stets über die fury und hecla strasse fort nach süden als dem schauplatz alter sagen hinweist und dass die westlichen eskimos ebenso den osten als das land ihrer sagenhaften helden und stämme betrachten gewinnt die vermuthung wahrscheinlichkeit dass im westen des hudson bay gebietes die heimath der weitverbreiteten stämme zu suchen ist

mortillet 1889 : [ 258 ] les groënlandais au point de vue paléoethnologique présentent un très grand intérêt 
ils paraissent se relier très intimement aux hommes qui habitaient l'europe moyenne pendant l'époque de la madeleine 
ils seraient les descendants directs des magdalèniens 
ils auraient successivement émigré vers le pôle avec l'animal caractéristique de cette époque le renne 
habitués aux froids les plus rigoureux de l'époque magdalénienne ils se sont retirés dans les régions froides du nord 
comme le voit il y la plus grande ressemblance tant sous le rapport physique moral que sous le rapport artistique industriel entre les hommes de la madeleine les groënlandais 
cette ressemblance est telle que nous pouvons en conclure que les seconds sont les descendants des premiers 
testut 1889 : [ 259 ] parmi les races actuelles celle qui parait présenter la plus grande analogie avec l'homme de chancelade est celle des esquimaux qui vivent encore à l'état sauvage dans leg glaces de l'amérique septentrionale 
ils ont en effet le même crâne que notre troglodyte quaternaire ; leur face est constituée suivant le même type ; ils ont à peu de chose près la même taille le même indice palatin le même indice nasal le même indice orbitaire le même degré de torsion de l'humérus 
la découverte de chancelade en mettant en lumière une analogie frappante entre le squelette de notre troglodyte périgourdin celui des esquimaux actuels apporte à cette opinion aussi séduisante que naturelle l'appui de l'anthropologie anatomique qui dans l'espèce une importance capitale 
elle lui est de tous points favorable élève à la hauteur d'une vérité probable je n'ose dire d'une vérité démontrée ce qui n'était encore qu'une simple hypothèse 
hervé 1893 : [ 260 ] par leurs usages par leurs moeurs aussi bien que par leur matériel industriel artistique les hyperboréens actuels ( tchouktches eskimaux ) sont extrêmement voisins des troglodytes magdaléniens de l'europe occidentale ; à ce point que hamy pu dire qu'ils continuent de nos jours dan les régions circumpolaires l'âge du renne de france de belgique de suisse avec ses caractéristiques zoologiques ethnographiques ( op cit 366 ) 
nous avons vu d'autre part que les plus purs d'entre eux ne diffèrent pas anatomiquement des magdaléniens 
c'est donc au rameau hyperboréen que nous sommes amenés à rattacher au point de vue ethnique les dernières populations de l'europe quaternaire 
boule 1913 : [ 261 ] sait d'ailleurs depuis les travaux de testut sur l'homme de chancelade que les relations des esquimaux sont avec d'autres hommes fossiles de nos pays mais d'un âge géologique plus récent

sans même supposer l'existence passée de la continuité des deux continents les hommes tertiaires ont bien pu faire ce que font les riverains actuels du détroit de behring qui vont chaque jour d'asie en amérique reciproquement 
evidemment la race esquimale est américaine 
au groënland au labrador dont personne ne lui disputé les solitudes glacées elle conservé sa pureté 
elle est encore restée pure quand elle rencontré les peaux rouges proprement dits parce que ceux ci lui ont fait une guerre d'extermination qui ne respectait ni les femmes ni les enfants

ces tribus sont de race jaune leur crâne ressemble si bien à celui des toungouses que m
