And to me--the adventure of whose owncareer has reached the inexorable _Finis_--these true stories of goldand gem seeking have an interest beyond the mere record of peril andachievement, though, in the words of Sir Philip Sidney, it "stirs theheart like a trumpet-blast" when brave men come to grips with dangerswhich (like the treasure-guarding dragons of fairy-tales) yield not onlytheir hoard, but their own strength, as reward to the conqueror.And these are true romances--no fiction with its _Deus ex machina_ atthe psychological moment, but the unadorned risks, escapes, and failuresof adventurers on the quest of those strange commodities, seeminglyhaunted by death and fear, from their secrecy in the recesses of theearth till they shine with a sinister light in the crowns of kings ormake rough, for better handling, the sword-grips of warriors.The quest of "El Dorado" begins with the history of man, and in pursuitof the glittering phantom have "many souls of heroes gone down intoHades," only that others might step into their empty places in theranks. For whatever is found, always just beyond reach flits what is notfound--what never will be, be it the golden city of Manoa, with itspalace of the Inca, "all the vessels of whose house and kitchen are ofgold, and in his wardrobe statues of gold which seemed giants, andropes, budgets, chests and troughs of gold," or the mysterious jewels ofthe wisdom of Solomon, or the genie-guarded gems of the Arabian Nights.The instinct of delight in this adventure which has dazzled the mind ofman from time immemorial is universal: it is a relish of youth whichpersists into the old age of the world; it warms the coldest blood; andour author, who has himself followed the mirage and felt the fascinationso keenly, is able to transmit the magic of the search to his readers.Whether toiling over the Chilcoot Pass, hunger-pinched, and desperatewith cold and exhaustion, or thirst-tormented in the burning deserts ofCentral Australia, the indomitable desire that drives him forward withhis comrades, drives us also on this modern Odyssey, where the Sirensings on beaches of dead men's bones, and perils as terrible as anyman-devouring Cyclops lie in wait for the wanderers.The author, leaving his book to the verdict of the public, is once morean explorer in the Australian deserts, collecting who knows what strangeexperiences for future use, so I may, in his absence, characterise himas a born leader of men, a very prudent Odysseus; for what lesserqualities could have held together so strangely assorted a band as therough-hewn Mac and Stewart and the gentleman adventurer Phil Morris?Reticence is perhaps unavoidable, but one would willingly see and hearmore of the central figure than his own modesty allows him to give us.Yet, as I said before, it is not only the adventure which gives a charmto these studies of wild life. They are little epics ofcomradeship--impressions of men to whom gold and jewels are much, but towhom loyalty is the one thing better. It is good to see the yellow gleamin the washings, and the milky fire of the Australian opal is worth theperils endured, but there is also the abiding knowledge that quite otherand less elusive treasures reward the quest--courage, endurance, andabove all--"the manly love of comrades."And to me--to whom some of these studies recall in keenest remembrancescenes which I shall never behold again with my living eyes--there isanother point of view and one of wider interest. Such men, in workingout their own destiny, are evolving also the imperial destiny of theMother-Country. They break the path, and other feet follow. There is themarch of an army behind them, for they are the vanguard ofcivilisation--the first spray of the tide that, however slowly it flows,does not ebb. It is well, since the change must come, that these men, ofgood home-spun stuff, honest and kindly in thought and deed, should beamong the forerunners of the race that will abide where it has set itsfeet. Scotland need not be ashamed of her sons as they stand before usin these true stories of daring and endurance, and speak with theirenemies in the gate.The inexhaustible mineral and gem deposits of New Guinea are onlyglanced at, but the description of those marvellous tropical forests,through whose deep ravines rush the gold-bearing torrents, from which"Mac" was able to wash out thirty pounds worth in one day, proves whatpossibilities England possesses in that great island, and sheds light onthe policy of a time, now happily past, when I had hoisted the Flag, in1872, and thus taken formal possession of Eastern New Guinea. I reportedto my chief, and his reply has a curious interest in view of many laterdevelopments."Have we not enough tropical possessions, without requiring more? Enoughissues to sap the strength of our Englishmen, without giving Governmentpatronage to the infliction of new wounds on our body? Enoughcircumstances in which there must be a subjected race alongside of ourEnglish proprietors, without putting the Government stamp on a newscheme which will help to demoralise us, and weaken our moral sense asa nation?"Such were the views of the Little Englanders thirty years ago. Such seemstrangely out of date when explorers of the Alexander Macdonald type aretapping the remotest sources of commerce in the interests of the oldcountry.So I leave the little band to the reader--very human, compound of greatgenerosities and small failings, travellers, like ourselves, on "theGreat Trail" that leads to the Mountains of the Moon, and beyond, butalways _men_, and knit together by so strong a bond that each might wellsay of the other, with Walt Whitman--             "Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade."

BLACKBECK,      _April 19, 1905_.PrefaceI desire to assure all readers of this book that the scenes heredepicted, and the events described, may be taken as faithfulrepresentations from life. I would also add that the geographicaldescriptions throughout are accurate in detail; my knowledge is borne oflong and varied experience in the countries of which I write.A friendly critic, on reviewing my MSS., said that the book might bemisunderstood because of its containing the remarks and conversations ofmy companions, which he considered could not very well have beenremembered by the writer. On this point, however, I beg to differ, and Ifeel that I shall have the sympathy of my fellow-wanderers on my side.When a man has travelled for many years with the same companions, andhas shared danger and sorrow and gladness with them, surely it is nottoo much to assume that he must ultimately know their temperaments well,and would scarcely need to draw upon his imagination when recallingtheir various remarks on striking incidents.At the conclusion of our Western Australian journey the outbreak of theSouth African war caused a temporary disbandment of my party, all ofwhose members served at the Front with the Australian Contingentsduring the campaign. As a result it will be observed that in the thirdpart of this volume the narratives partake somewhat of a general nature,and are also more or less disconnected.Finally let me say in extenuation of any brusqueness or crudity ofexpression which may be noticeable, that I write as a traveller whosehand has more often gripped the rifle and sextant than the pen.

'Over the mountains      Of the moon,    Down in the valley of the Shadow,      Ride, boldly ride,'      The Shade replied    'If you seek for El Dorado.'"UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE WHITE PASSI have stumbled upon a few "tough" corners of the globe during mywanderings beyond the outposts of civilisation, but I think the mostoutrageously lawless quarter I ever struck was Skagway in the days ofits early infancy. Now, I am told, Skagway is a flourishing township,boasting of the orthodox amount of "broad" streets and "palatial"buildings for an American "boom" camp. This may be, though--unless thegeographical features of the district have altered--I can hardly creditit. When I was there the embryo city balanced itself precariously alongthe lower slopes of the White Pass, and a good percentage of thepopulation had to be content with huts built on piles within the tidallimit of the Lynn Canal. In short, there was no room to build anything,and Skagway existed simply because it marked the entry to the Yukon'sfrozen treasure. Its permanent residents were, for the most part,sharpers of the worst type; indeed, it seemed as if the scum of theearth had hastened here to fleece and rob, or, failing those gentlearts, to murder the unwary voyagers to or from the Golden North. Therewas no law whatsoever; might was right, the dead shot only was immunefrom danger.It was late autumn in the year when the first news of Klondike richesburst upon the world, when I, with my companion Mac, arrived at the headof the Lynn inlet, _en route_ for the land of snows and nuggets. Ourship, the _Rosalie_, carried a goodly number of passengers, but theywere mainly of the ruffian "store and saloon-keeper" variety, and few,if any, of them ever got beyond the pass. The true gold-miner isproverbially poor, and as yet his kind had not been numerous on thetrail. As for myself, I was enterprising if nothing else, and mycompanion made up for my deficiencies in other respects. He was aferocious individual without a doubt, my worthy henchman; without him myearly journeyings would have ended before they had well begun, but,being a hardened traveller, he knew how to adapt himself tocircumstances, and how to come off best in a scrimmage, both of whichtraits were brought fully out before we had been long in the villainouslittle camp of Skagway. Our first twenty-four hours' experiences may beworth relating.We were the only representatives of Old England in these uncouth partsat this period, a fact which had not made us any more beloved by theaggressively hostile Yankees on board the _Rosalie_. Times withoutnumber they told me how the "great American nation" could wipe theBritish Isles off the face of the earth at a moment's notice, and how a"free-born American" was equal to a dozen Britishers, and how we twowould be swallowed alive by these same men should we dare say a word tothe contrary. We bore a good deal of this sort of thing in silence,though occasionally throughout the protracted voyage my fieryaide-de-camp retaliated angrily, and did considerable damage among histormentors, who proved to be warlike only in their speech. But this is adigression, and though I could write pages on that momentous cruise--weran aground five times, and were practically wrecked twice--I mustdesist and continue my narrative.The first man we saw after being dumped on the muddy shores of SkagwayBay was a short, red-headed individual, with ruddy countenance to match,who fairly bristled with weapons of the most bloodthirsty description.He approached Mac and me as we stood hesitatingly by the water's edgelooking around for some habitation wherein we might find refuge for thefirst night of our sojourn in a strange land."Hallo, stranger!" he saluted, affably, firing a huge revolverunpleasantly close to my ear in a most nonchalant manner."Hallo!" I said without enthusiasm, feeling cautiously in the rear of mynether garments to make sure that my own gun was where it ought to be.He seemed somewhat hurt at the stiffness of my rejoinder, and toyedsuggestively with his revolver for some moments without speaking.Meanwhile Mac proceeded unconcernedly along the beach to where a hugehulk lay moored, whose broad beam bore the legend in giantletters--"Skagit Hotel. Recently of San Francisco. Finest accommodationin town."I was preparing to follow in my comrade's footsteps, marvelling at theenterprise which had brought the old dismasted schooner so opportunelyto such a region; but my friend with the gun was not to be put off."Say, stranger," he growled, stepping before me, "you don't know who Iam, I reckon----""I don't," I interrupted, shortly, "and I am not over anxious to makeyour acquaintance either."He glared at me savagely for an instant, then broke out into a heartylaugh. "For a darned Englisher you are mighty pert," he said, "an' Iwon't slaughter you--just yet. Still, for your future benefit I may tellyou that my handle is Soapy Sam, an' I've planted considerable men likeyou in my time. I'm a bad man, I is, but your ignorance saves ye."The conversation was being uncomfortably prolonged; yet I dared not makeany movement. "What's the damage, Soapy?" I asked contritely. "I supposeyou are collecting toll in your polite way?"He lowered his weapon and grinned. "Every tenderfoot as lands in thishere city has to play poker with me or fight," he acknowledgedsmilingly.I realised my position at once. It was painfully clear to me that the"fight" would be all on one side, and could only end in one way so longas Soapy held the "drop," and it was also clear that the alternative wasto submit to wholesale robbery. A loud shout at our back made us bothturn with alacrity, and behold there stood Mac with his long Winchesterrepeater levelled fairly at Soapy Samuel's head. The wily individual hadscented danger, and had made a _détour_ expressly for my benefit."Say when," he murmured calmly, from behind his artillery, "and I'llblow the deevil into vulgar fractions."I stepped out of range of fire without delay. Soapy's fingers twitchedon the stock of his lowered revolver as his ferret-like eyes blinkeddown the muzzle of the deadly tube, which never wavered a hair'sbreadth. Then his weapon dropped from his nerveless hand, and slowly hisarms were upraised towards the sky, and he smiled an exceedingly sicklysmile."You've got the pull on me this time, partner," he said. "I caves."At this moment a hoarse chorus of cheers rang out from the vicinity ofthe Skagit Hotel. The inmates had assembled on the upper deck to witnessthe discomfiture of their common enemy."Shoot him!" they roared; "he killed old Smith."But Mac was not disposed to make himself public executioner. "Ye'dbetter vanish, Soapy," he grunted.[Illustration: A PARTY OF MINERS GOING IN BY THE SKAGWAY OR               WHITE PASS TRAIL.]"Never mind the cannon ye dropped; it'll just suit me. Quick, fur I'mgetting nervish."Soapy fled, slipping and stumbling through the snow in his intensehaste. But when he had placed a good hundred yards between him and hisconqueror, he turned and waved his hand cheerily."I bear no ill-will, boys," he shouted; "I was clean bested. But," andhe turned towards the _Skagit_, "I'll have it out with you afore long,and don't forgit it."A yell of derision greeted him in return. Apparently the _Skagit_dwellers meant to take all chances with a light heart. Mac grounded hisrifle with a grunt of satisfaction."This is the deevil's ain country we've struck," he grumbled. "It's ablessed thing I got insured afore I left auld Scotland." I agreed withhim heartily, and together we sought the hospitable shelter of thestranded hotel, where we were welcomed effusively by the proprietorthereof, a merry-faced Irishman of the name of O'Connor."We're chock full up, but we'll gladly make room for you, boys," hesaid. "It wouldn't be safe to allow you to go up among Soapy's gang."I expressed my gratitude for his tender solicitude, then made sundryinquiries as to the prospects of crossing the pass within the next dayor so."You want to cross the pass?" he echoed, in amazement. "Why, you won'tbe able to do that until next spring. The snows are on, and the trail isblocked with hundreds of dead horses anyhow."I had heard this statement so often of late that I was in nowise takenaback. "We certainly did not come here for the good of our health," Isaid. "We'll try the Chilcoot Pass if the Skagway route is impossible.Dyea is not very far from here, I think?""Only about four miles round about," he replied. "It is at the head ofthe inlet you would see before your ship branched in here. A mightymiserable place it is, for the winds sweep right down from the seaalmost constantly.""We didn't expect to find roses growing on the track," snorted Mac,impatiently. "We'll try and get round to Dyea in the morning."But now another difficulty arose. There were no boats to be had stoutenough to withstand the heavy gales which, as we had just been told,blew ceaselessly up the funnel-like entrance to the Chilcoot Valley, andeven if there had been, our outfit of flour and miscellaneous foodstuffswas rather an unwieldy factor to be considered."It's a maist ungodly country," commented Mac gloomily. "There seems tobe nae room for anybody but thieves an' murderers, and it' very funnythat there's no' an honest gold-miner among the lot."Our fellow-passengers nearly all had found congenial quarters furtherback in the city, and one or two had erected their tents on the beach,forgetting in their haste to found a home that the tide would wash overtheir camp site about twelve o'clock that same night. Yet no one caredto inform them on the matter, and Mac watched their progress withundisguised joy, and howled with delight when one of his old enemiesbegan to haul timber from the hillside for the purpose of building asubstantial edifice on the sinking sands."They might know that the old _Skagit_ couldn't have walked up here,"laughed our host. "But they'll find out their mistake soon enough, Ireckon," and he chuckled, long and loudly.Having partaken of dinner, Mac and I sallied forth to visit thescattered array of huts and tents which constituted the town."Look out for Soapy Sam," warned a swarthy-visaged man in picturesqueattire. "He's a nasty sort of skunk to meet, even in the daytime, as youalready know. If ye get into trouble just yell on me--Black Harry is myhandle--and I'll be with you in a couple of shakes."I thanked the dusky warrior, who indeed looked as if he could give avery good account of himself when necessary, and with the butt of myrevolver clutched tightly in my hand, I walked citywards with Mac, whogravely whistled selections from a hymn entitled, "There is a HappyLand." On our arrival in Klondike Avenue, as the main thoroughfare waselegantly styled, not a solitary individual was to be seen. The weatherwas bitterly cold, and the denizens of the camp, with commendable goodsense, avoided all danger of frostbite by keeping within the shelter oftheir wigwams. The deserted avenue was therefore a most drearyspectacle, and the gathering shadows of night hanging over the grim passin the background did not tend to enliven the gloom of the scene."And to think that for the last fortnight I hae heard nothing butstories o' American grit, American hardiness, American--everything,"soliloquised Mac, sarcastically; "yet every deevil o' them is frichtenedo' catchin' cold--but hallo! what's this?"He directed my gaze towards a flaring poster nailed to a tree. Weapproached, and read the rude notice. "In the Skagit Hall to-night.Grand concert. Miss Caprice, of New York, the world-famed varietyactress, will hold the camp in thrall. Leave your guns at home, and comeearly to avoid the rush. N.B.--Poker tables have been fixed up for theconvenience of the audience."The last clause gave the key to the whole concern. Miss Caprice--whoeverthat might be--was merely an extra attraction. Appended was a weirddiagram purporting to be a sketch of the aforesaid Miss Caprice inthe intricacies of one of her dance specialities. Mac shuddered andlooked pained."This is maist decidedly no place for a white man," he asserted, with asigh. Then we turned and headed back for the _Skagit_, where in thelater hours the world-famed artiste was billed to disport herself. As wepassed by a large log structure set back among the trees, I wassurprised to hear a husky voice call out to us, and while we hesitatedthe door of the hut swung open, and Soapy Sam appeared and beckonedmysteriously. He apparently had discarded his armoury, but I was notdisposed to trust much to appearances, at which our old enemy lookedconsiderably aggrieved."I bear no grudge, boys," he said. "No man can say that Soapy Sam wentback on his word. You downed me fair.""Then what is it?" I inquired suspiciously."Ye must admit, Soapy, ma man," added Mac drily, "that your reputationeven among yer ain folk is no' just rosy."But Soapy was evidently determined not to be offended by anything wemight say. He approached with hands extended in token of good faith,and, noting this, we stayed our progress and waited wonderingly to hearwhat he wished to speak. He did not enlighten us much, however."I say, boys," he whispered when he came near, "can you both swim?"Mac nodded. "But it wouldna be a pleasant diversion in this weather," heremarked, with a shudder."Then don't go near the _Skagit_ to-night," said Soapy impressively."There's a storm rising, and I shouldn't wonder if the old barge burstsher moorings before morning."He was gone in an instant, and Mac and I gazed at each other in dismay."What can he mean?" I said."Heaven knows," growled Mac; "but we'll likely find out before verylong. He's a gey slippery customer, is Soapy, an' no' easily understood,I'm thinkin'."We continued on our course meditating deeply, but, no solution of themysterious warning presenting itself, it escaped our minds utterly inthe noisy excitement that prevailed on our return to the _Skagit_.O'Connor, the proprietor, was all agog with the importance of hisposition as master of ceremonies; he was busily superintending theplacing of a rickety old piano when we made our appearance, and heimmediately seized on Mac for a song during the evening, a favour whichwas most promptly refused."Miss Caprice an' me wouldna suit on the same programme," was the worthydiplomatist's excuse. "Get Black Harry an' Soapy Sam--""Soapy Sam is barred this circus," sternly interrupted O'Connor. "I'mrunning a concert to-night, not a funeral undertaking establishment."Assuredly Soapy Sam's prowess was no mean factor to be considered.At 7 p.m. prompt--as advertised--the entertainment began. The room wascrowded with truly all sorts and conditions of men, and the air reekedwith tobacco smoke. The piano manipulator--a bewhiskered andgroggy-looking personage in top-boots--took his place with stately graceas befitted the dignity of his office. He ran his fingers clumsily overthe keys as if seeking for some lost chord or combination, which,however, he did not find, and then he rattled out an ear-shatteringmelody in which the audience, after a moment's pause, joined lustily. Inthe midst of the uproar thus let loose a gaudily-bedecked creature ofthe female persuasion, wearing a grin that almost obliterated herfeatures, appeared on the raised stage at the end of the saloon, andjoined in the pandemonium, her shrill voice screaming out the touchinginformation that there would be "a hot time in the old town to-night,"which coincided with the item on the programme.This was Miss Caprice--a type of the "noble and enduring" women whomrecent "Klondike" novelists have portrayed so tenderly in their"realistic" romances. Heaven forbid that the respectable British publicshould be thus deceived. There was no woman with any claim to the nameon the long trail in these days.It would be impossible to describe the course of that memorable"concert." It continued in spasms--or turns, which I believe is thecorrect term to use--far into the night, with occasional interruptionsin the shape of fights and wordy altercations among the poker players,diversions which lent pleasurable variety to the entertainment, thoughnow and again it seemed as if a funeral or two would surely resulttherefrom. But all smoothed off harmoniously under the influence of MissCaprice's moving melodies, which always were turned on at opportunemoments. Mac said that her voice was like unto the buzzing of a steamsaw in cross-grained wood, but perhaps he was prejudiced, or hisartistic senses a trifle too fine. Anyhow, she pleased the multitudemightily, and they roared out their appreciation boisterously at theconclusion of each of her vocal exercises, and implored her to continueher soothing ditties unendingly. The too free use of the flowing bowlwas probably accountable for the warmth of their approval; but MissCaprice, having indulged in equal degree with her admirers, was gettingless and less able to trill forth sweet sounds for their edification,and matters were fast beginning to assume a by no means invitingaspect.Several times during the progress of events Mac and I endeavoured tomake an unobtrusive exit, but all to no purpose.Slowly the time dragged on its weary course, then suddenly I becameaware that the old _Skagit_ was rising with the incoming tide. Sheswayed cumbrously once or twice, and her rotten timbers creaked andgroaned dismally under the strain, but no one seemed to consider theseindications worthy of attention, and the roystering chorus went onwithout interruption. At intervals I could hear vague voices callingexcitedly without, and I guessed that the men who had built their homesin the sand were having a bad time.Another half-hour passed. By this time the taste of the audience hadreached the sentimental stage, and they loudly clamoured for a songsuited to their altered temperament. The accompanist, however, persistedin playing the "hot time" tune to everything, so he was discharged withignominy by the scornful prima donna, who announced in broken accentsthat she would give a rendering of "Ashtore" without musical assistance,which was most unwise on her part. Still, she persisted at her task, andgot to the end of the first verse without mishap; but as she screamedout the last wailing notes of the chorus the old _Skagit_ gave a suddenlurch, and sent her reeling head foremost into the centre of the room."What's the matter with the darned barge?" howled several indignantvoices among the crowd, but no answer was forthcoming. The _Skagit_ atthat moment was seized with convulsions, and rolled and pitched in amost unaccountable manner."Howlin' blazes!" yelled Black Harry. "The happy home must have brokenloose."The rush that followed is beyond description. Mac and I, being lessaffected by the motion of the hulk than the majority, reached the deckfirst. Away far back to the right the lights of Skagway shimmered outover the smooth waters of Skagway Bay. To the left the faintilluminations of Healy's Store at Dyea shone at the head of the ChilcootInlet, along which great seas were rolling in from the main channel. Wehad drifted out with the ebbing tide, and we were now being borneonwards by the uninterrupted ocean gales. If we escaped being dashed topieces against the rocky bluffs of the peninsula, we might be drivenashore on the mud banks at Dyea; but it was certain that the _Skagit_could not return to her wonted anchorage that night.Loud and deep were the curses that now arose from all on board."It's Soapy Sam's work," howled O'Connor. "He must have cut themoorings. He said he would do it."Then I remembered Soapy's warning, but held my peace, and while the menraved, and threatened, and prayed in turn, the old _Skagit_ dashed onher new course, buffeted by the great seething rollers crowding in fromthe sea, and spinning like a top in the swirling waters. Crash! At lastwe had struck, and the surging waves swept over the deck in a copiousflood, and the night was filled with the shrieks of the frenzied band,who feared the worst; but it was only a sand bar after all, the first ofa series of similar obstacles that bar the Dyea Channel at high water."We could never have got round here ourselves," muttered Mac, as westood watching the slowly-receding waves. "It is a fact that it's a geyill wind that blaws naebody good."In a short space the _Skagit_ lay high and dry where she had beendeposited, and for the first time we learned that the Dyea Bar stretchesout three miles from the village. But I was satisfied. As Mac hadimplied, the _Skagit_ had unconsciously done us a service of no meanorder in transporting our outfit nearer the Chilcoot Pass. With calmcontentment he and I sought peaceful slumber in the humble quartersallotted to us earlier in the day, while the rest of the ship'scompany--including Miss Caprice--started to climb the dividing mountainridge to Skagway on the trail of the elusive Soapy.SHOOTING THE WHITE HORSE RAPIDSIt was a month later when we reached the shores of Lake Linderman _enroute_ for the frozen North. The Chilcoot Pass had presented an almostimpassable barrier to our advance; a light film of snow clung to thebare rocks and filled the numberless crevices of the "Summit"--that lastgrim climb, where the Dyea trail mounts all but perpendicularly upwardsto the blizzard-swept glacier cap of the pass--and no room for footholdcould be traced. It would be impossible to describe that frightfulclimb. When we reached the top and saw far below the twisting line ofIndian "packers," who seemed to stick like flies to the white wall, wecould not understand how the ascent had been accomplished.Crater Lake, on the "other" side, was covered with a broad sheet of icewhich was not sufficiently strong to bear our sleighs, or weak enough toallow of a passage being broken for our portable canvas boat. Here wewere delayed many days, laboriously dragging our outfit to a less loftyand more congenial climate.Long Lake, Deep Lake, and Mud Lake were successfully negotiated in turn;their waters glistened cold and cheerless, surrounded by the great snowypeaks that were rapidly opening out into the magnificent Yukon valley.Far down in the hollow, seemingly in a sunnier and well-timbered spot,nestled Lake Linderman, and beyond, the Yukon channel could be tracedbetween the ever-widening mountain ranges. We had packed sleighs inour outfit, not expecting to use them until we reached the Klondikeriver, and how successful they might prove should it be necessary toforce a trail across the frozen waters was a matter for conjecture.[Illustration: THE CHILCOOT PASS.]At this time Linderman's shores were the scene of much bustle; manyintending voyagers were building their boats in feverish haste, for theyknew that the elements must soon lay firm grip on the waters, and rendertheir work useless.Major Walsh, the Canadian Administrator of the Yukon Territory, had justmade his appearance from over the Skagway trail, and he was alleagerness to proceed. He immediately bought--at fabulous prices--theboats that were built, and, without a day's delay, set sail northwardswith his staff.Two days after the Major's departure, I succeeded in purchasing atwenty-feet "Dorie" from a disheartened miner who had decided to returnto Dyea, and wait for the ensuing spring.I need not detail our journeyings for the next few days. Linderman wassailed over within two hours, then the half-mile porterage between itand Lake Bennet was accomplished after much labour. This latter lake istwenty-eight miles in length, its northern extremity narrowing down to adeep and swift-flowing channel, which extends but a few hundred yardsbefore expanding into a broad, shallow lake or lagoon, colloquiallyknown as "Caribou Crossing." The current here is sluggish, and the waterabounds in shoals and sandbanks, which at that time were a sore trial tothe adventuresome navigator with his precious freight of flour and othernecessaries.Tagash Lake forms the next link in the great lake chain of the Yukon,and it stretches full twenty-nine miles, then contracting to afierce-flowing stream by which the Canadian Customs Offices are nowstationed.Beyond this is Marsh Lake, and here it was that our troubles began.Not a breath of wind stirred the waters of the lake, and ourcrudely-built dorie, containing 1,000 pounds of flour and 1,000 poundsof miscellaneous foodstuffs, ploughed slowly through the wide expanse tothe accompaniment of much wheezing and groaning of oars, and an endlessstring of forcible expletives that burst from the lips of my stalwartcompanions, who provided the motive power of the ungainly craft. Thefavouring wind had died away, and, unaided by the sails, we could makebut little headway over the still water. The weather had becomestrangely cold considering the earliness of the season, and I was almostbenumbed as I sat in the steersman's perch, directing the course bysundry sweeps of a great-bladed Indian paddle, which I wielded with bothhands."Keep it up, boys," I encouraged. "We are more than half-way through thelake.""Twa miles an 'oor," grunted Mac between his efforts. "This is the worstboat I ever pulled."Stewart, his companion, another brawny Scot who had joined me at Dyea,rested his oar for a moment to breathe a sympathetic swear word of muchintensity; then together they bent to their labours, and the rasp of theoars, and the brief swish of the eddying pools created, alone broke thedeadly quiet.Towards nightfall I was surprised to notice here and there large sheetsof ice on the lake surface, and occasionally our heavily-laden boatwould grind against these obstacles, shouldering them off with mucheffort: then my oarsmen's long sweeps would rend and split them as theypassed alongside.It was very plain that the Yukon headwaters were fast freezing over."We'll have to keep going all night, boys," I said, "for we'll be icejammed if we camp anywhere around here."The fierce torrent issuing from the end of the lake and rushing towardsthe dread White Horse Rapids would in all probability be free fromice--if we could reach that far.Strenuously my companions pulled at their oars. The gloom deepened, thenthe stars came out, and by their feeble light I could distinguish farahead a scintillating field of ice.The sight caused me almost to despair--we had been sailing since earlymorning, and were tired and very hungry.Before I could get the head of our boat turned inshore, it had crashedthrough several flaking sheets, and immediately after I realised that wewere hopelessly in an ice maze from which there seemed no exit."We'll gang straight on," said Mac, with determination, and he leveredpowerfully with his oar against the frosted masses.A quarter of an hour passed, then the up-turning stem of the dorie wentthud against an immovable barrier, and I knew that we were indeedice-jammed beyond the possibility of forcing a passage with the oars.Nor could we return, for the ice-pack we had negotiated for miles wasnow seemingly welded together in one solid mass.Cautiously Mac put his moccasined foot over the prow and bore heavily onthe glittering ice; it neither strained nor yielded.With a fervent malediction he jumped on "shore," and felt the edge ofthe sheet."It's mair than twa inches," he said sorrowfully. "Hoo can we getthrough this?"Very sadly we got out of our boat, and, taking the cooking utensils, thetent, and some flour and coffee, sought a sheltered spot among the densetimber on the lake side. Soon we had almost forgotten our woes, and wereregaling ourselves with copious draughts of coffee and much hard damper.From our tent door we could see our boat stuck fast amid the ice. How wewere to get it free I could not well imagine. In the morning, however,we awoke with renewed energy and more hopeful hearts."We cannot have far to go, boys," I said. "We'll cut down a couple oftrees and use them to break a passage."After breakfast we lost no time in making the effort. Armed with theheavy logs, we re-embarked, and soon the ponderous hammers had beguntheir work and a passage was slowly made towards the Yukon. With greatreluctance our boat moved ahead, leaving a trail of glittering iceboulders. Mac leaned over the bow and opened the channel, while Stewartand I belaboured the masses that closed in on either side.About midday we neared the end of the lake, and the channel beyondappeared a rippling, crackling flood of jagged ice-floes.We felt the suction of the current long before we had reached the limitof the ice-field. The sheets became thinner and broke away readily, sothat the oars came again into play, and we crashed onward impetuously onthe bosom of an irresistible stream.At last we were free, and our boat dashed madly into the narrow egress,bumping, grinding, and rocking against the detached fragments of icethat appeared everywhere.With a great effort we managed to slow our craft before coming intocontact with a sharp jutting rock that reared high in the middle of thestream, and then we found that it required all our energies to evade theminiature icebergs that rushed alongside. These floating dangers lookedharmless enough, yet they were fully six inches deep in the water, andcontact with them would result in much damage to the planks of ourdorie. Several times, indeed, we were almost overturned by collidingwith unusually large floes.In another hour we had nearly navigated the extent of Miles's canyon,and only several hundred yards ahead I noticed Major Walsh's flotilla,buffetting the seething waters cumbrously, while the men at the oarsstrained every muscle to escape the perils that abounded in theircourse."We're not far away from the White Horse, boys," I said to my sturdyhenchmen, who were working away like galley slaves. They ceased theirlabours for a moment to look round, and at once our vessel swung aboutand drifted dangerously near the rocky river steeps."We maun keep a way on her," said Stewart."Let's ken when we're through," said Mac, and their oars cleft the waterlike the paddle floats of a fast river steamer.The current was flowing at the rate of ten miles an hour, and to keep asteering way on our unwieldy barge was, as may be understood, no easymatter.Frantically I swung my paddle and strove my utmost to avert the calamitythat every moment seemed to threaten us.We were rapidly gaining on Major Walsh's outfit. He had four boats inall, three of them being clumsy barges laden entirely with provisions.These latter were manned by several members of the North-West MountedPolice, who worked their oars from difficult-looking perches among theflour sacks.The police boats, however, steered a very erratic course, sometimesbeing carried forward almost on their beam ends. I guessed that theheavily freighted craft had become unmanageable; certainly the steersmenseemed to have no control. Yet I had little time to notice those ahead,for our own "clipper" required every attention."Keep her going, boys," I yelled, as I worked my steering paddle with awill, evading rocks, boulders, and ice floes in turn.Suddenly the white dashing surf of the Rapids came into view, the rivernarrowed to a fraction of its former width, and over the cataract ajagged sea of the dangerous floes crackled and roared into the abyssbeyond.I saw the Major's first boat fly like an arrow from the bow into theheart of the boiling foam; it careened dangerously on taking the sweep,then righted itself and disappeared into the flying mists."Steady, Mac!" I cried, as our craft entered the race. The dense sprayalmost obscured the great deflecting rock, and we rushed seemingly todestruction.Then, before my eyes, there appeared an awful spectacle. Faster than Ican write the words--one, two, three--each of Major Walsh's three boatsreared high in the sleety mist and overturned one after the other asthey took the curve."Let her go, boys," I bellowed. "Bend to it." The crucial moment hadarrived; we were enveloped in foam, and were dashing straight towardsthe torrent-deflecting bluff. I leaned far back over the stern of ourhalf-submerged boat, and with a mighty stroke of the paddle swung herhead round, and we grazed death by barely half a dozen inches.[Illustration: AFTER THE RAPIDS.][Illustration: KLONDIKE-BOUND MINERS AND THEIR OUTFITS ON               LAKE LINDERMAN.]A moment more and we were floating in almost placid waters. Beside usbobbed three smashed boats. Major Walsh stood sorrowfully on shoreassisting dripping men from the water."It's all over, boys," I said to my crew; "you can ease off now," and Isteered for the beach and lent my aid in the work of rescue.The half-drowned Canadians were dragged ashore gasping and almostsenseless, and while we scanned the grim waters anxiously for a trace ofone still missing, his body was tossed at our feet by the relentlesswaves. Soon after, the sand was littered with sacks of flour, and beans,and miscellaneous foodstuffs.Several camps were in evidence around this melancholy spot, erected bymen who had lost their all in the rapids, and were only waiting a chanceto return to civilisation. They eagerly accepted the Major's offer topurchase their scanty outfits, and without loss of time that intrepidold Indian fighter had embarked again for the north. To him it was arace with the elements, but the elements won after all, and compelledhim to make his winter camp at Big Salmon River, forty miles furthernorth, where we overtook him a few days later."It's no use my lads, you can't do it!" he said, on my reiterating myintention of proceeding onwards. "Why, the river's frozen solid fromhere to St. Michael's.""Then we'll put skids under the old boat and make her into a sledge,"quoth Mac, drily, and I hailed the suggestion with encouragement.We duly arrived at Dawson City after many days and weeks of ceaselessstruggle with the elements on that long and terrible icy trail, and ourcoming was received with rejoicings by the few half-starved miners whoat that time peopled the "City." We had proved the feasibility of anover-ice route to Dyea.THE LAND OF THE THRON-DIUCKSThe Klondike Valley in that winter was the scene of many stirringincidents. Owing to the non-arrival of the Canadian GovernmentCommissioner and his police no law or order prevailed. To make mattersworse the utmost bitterness existed between the Canadian and Americansections of the community, each of whom claimed the rich gold-bearingterritory as being within their country's boundary. Quarrels more orless serious were consequently of every-day occurrence. However, thefollowing incident involves no harrowing description of these fierceskirmishes--though it might have led to a most sanguinary encounter withthe _true_ owners of the land.Accompanied by "Cap." Campbell and "Alf" Mackay, two well-known miners,my party set out on a prospecting expedition into the mountains flankingthe upper reaches of the Klondike River. We had one dog, a powerfulmastiff, named Dave, which had proved an invaluable companion to me onour earlier prospecting journeys. Previous to this we had been verysuccessful in our quest for the yellow metal, having located threecreeks rich in the precious golden sand. But our eagerness seemed likelyto cost us dear, for our store of foodstuffs had become wonderfullysmall, and we were many days' journey from our camp on Skookum Gulch,where were our headquarters.The return journey proved to be more difficult than we had anticipated;the weather had been very severe for the last few days, and the snow onthe hillside was hard and dangerously slippery."We'll try a short cut over the mountains, boys," said Mackay, as westrove vainly to reach the frozen river far beneath.The Klondike takes many twists in its erratic course, and it so happenedthat if we could cross a mountain spur we should strike the trail only afew miles from Eldorado Creek."We'll make the attempt," I said, and Mac and Stewart concurred withemphatic ejaculations. One sleigh carried the possessions of the wholeparty, and it was tugged along by our combined efforts, including theassistance of Dave, who struggled in his harness in the leader'sposition. At last we surmounted the great glacier-capped ridge andgingerly made a trail through a narrow ice-bound gulch issuing from thecrystal dome and marking a long line of gigantic ice boulders far intothe wooded slopes beyond.We slid, and clambered, and buffeted with the snow wreaths andintervening ice fields for over an hour, and then the gully led usacross a thickly-timbered flat well sheltered from the elements by thesurrounding mountains. At this stage we were, to judge by the lay of thecountry, but a few miles from the main channel; but the afternoon wasfar advanced and darkness was quickly closing over the valley, so thatfurther progress was rendered difficult. We were looking about for asuitable camping ground when Mac, who had been closely examining thelandscape, gave a howl of delight. "Injuns!" he roared, "I see Injunhooses!" Sure enough there appeared, nestling among the drooping pines,a straggling array of Indian huts and several totem poles. Before Icould restrain them, my henchmen dropped their sleigh ropes and rushedimpetuously towards the supposed settlement, but their moccasined feetstuck deeply in the soft snow under the trees, and, using my snowshoesto good effect, I succeeded in rounding up the doughty pair before theyhad gone far."It's an Indian village," I explained, "and not a circus.""I ken weel what it is," indignantly howled Mac. "Hiv I no seen Injunsafore? When I wis oot on the pampas o' Sooth America--"But I listened no further, and Stewart condoled with his comrade in wellchosen words of sympathy."This is nae country for us, Mac," said he. "A lot o' Injun hooses,wi'--wi' chunks o' caribou hangin' inside, an' we maunna touch them!" Healmost wept at the thought."Howlin' blazes, boys!" shouted the Captain, "them Injuns'd make ye intomince pies at oncet; ye wur committin' sooicide!"But Mackay smiled broadly and winked reassuringly at Mac, whereupon thatgentleman began to chuckle audibly."We've nae floor, an' nae bacon, an' nae beans--nae naething," he saidmeaningly. "If you have no 'jeckshuns,'" added Mackay, addressing mewith much deliberation, "we'll camp a leetle furrer down."I had no objections whatever. If I had, it might not have mattered much,for my warlike retainers seemed on the verge of mutiny. So we proceededon our way, cautiously and silently, keeping in the densest shadows, andas far distant from the village as we could conveniently get.Ten minutes later our tent was fixed and our camp fire blazing brightly;and Stewart, with a lugubrious countenance, busied himself preparing thelast of our hoarded stores. Our fare was certainly meagre andunsatisfying, and unfortunately the keen air had given us extremelyhealthy appetites. I am inclined to think, when I recall the matter,that my share, as doled out by Stewart, with many a sigh at itsdiminutive proportions, was unnecessarily meagre, and purposely servedso by that wily individual in order to destroy any conscientiousscruples I might have. If that was his purpose it succeeded admirably,for when my humble repast was finished I felt hungrier than ever, andhad not the ghost of a scruple left."Talkin' about Injun villages," began Mackay, when the cooking utensilshad been cleared away, "I've niver seen wan yet that hadn't a winterstorehouse of dried salmon and cariboo somewheres handy.""Ye're a man efter ma ain heart," beamingly interrupted Mac, and Stewartmurmured: "Dried cariboo!" and smacked his lips."As I was discoursin'," continued Mackay, "them Injuns hiv always gotrations hid away in their wigwams.""Likewise a few tommy-hawks an' an assortment o' clubs," grimly edged inthe Captain.No one seemed anxious to say anything in a direct sort of way, althoughthe general meaning was plain enough."To cut it short, boys," I ventured to remark, "you are in favour ofvisiting the village to-night?""Fur reasons which it ain't necessary to shout out loud--precisely,"answered Mackay.After that further speech was superfluous, and we made hurriedpreparations for our marauding journey. The Indians at this time werevery hostile towards the white invaders of their country, and there waslittle reason to hope that they would either barter or sell any of theirstores to us. There is a proverb which states that "necessity knows nolaw," and as we were in rather a sad plight we agreed with it to theletter; there may have been room for some slight condonation of ourerrors of reason at such a time. About eight o'clock that night wesallied out, leaving Mac with the dog in charge of the sleigh, withinstructions to clear out lively should he hear a revolver shot. Theworthy Mac was much disgusted with his lot, and gave vent to hisannoyance in no stinted terms."It wis ma idee at first," he grumbled, "an' it's gey hard fur a man taebe sacrifeeced tae wait here a' the time.""You've got the healthiest job, my friend," said the Captain, "an' youought to be durned well pleased."The moon shone brilliantly, illuminating the open snow patches andshooting down through the heavy foliage myriad rays of dancing light. Iremember well how we had hoped for darkness, and how nervously we creptalong seeking the shelter of the deepest shadows. A death-like stillnessreigned; the thermometer in camp had registered 37 degrees below zero,and we knew that the mercury would keep falling till midnight. Our faceswere quickly framed in icicles, and a thin dazzling frost draped us fromhead to foot. We presented truly ghost-like figures, but we were toomuch engrossed with other matters to notice our strange appearance. Soonwe arrived within sight of the village, and stealthily we manoeuvredfrom tree to tree until we were but a few yards distant from the largestlogged structure. And still not a sound was heard; the frosted edificesshowed no sign of life within."Seems to me we're in luck," chuckled Mackay, gazing on the desolatescene with evident enjoyment. "The population has evidently gone outhuntin' bear or moose deer, or some sich quodroo-ped, and thar shidtherefore be no call fur any skirmish. Put up your guns, boys," headded, "there's nary soul in the village."We were all greatly relieved at this, yet it was with a feeling of deephumiliation that I approached the most imposing of the houses and beganto investigate the best and surest means of forcing an entry. I had seena few Indian buildings in my travels, but this one was unlike any designI had ever witnessed. There appeared to be two heavily-barricaded woodenwindows in the usual places, but search as we might, no door could befound."We'll try another," said Mackay, loath to acknowledge that the peculiarstructure was beyond his comprehension. We examined each one--there weresix in all--but they were alike in every particular, save that the onewhich had first received our attention was larger than the others, andhad a very imposing totem pole in its foreground."The first was the most likely, boys," I said, "we'll go back to it."And back we went.Stewart was now working up something approaching a righteous wrathagainst the "heathen sort o' buildin's." "I'll shin mak' a door," hesaid, with emphasis, bracing his shoulders; then something caught hiseye on the rough planking walls, and he beckoned to me mysteriouslybefore applying his energy towards their demolition."What is it?" asked Mackay impatiently."Come and hold a match," I said. He did so, while I laboriously spelledout a series of Chinook characters which had evidently been cut deepinto the wood through the agency of some sharp instrument, most probablya tomahawk. The result was rather mystifying, for, translating intoEnglish, I read twelve names ending with the words, "_Chief of theThron-Diucks_." Eleven of the names were simply unpronounceable, but thelast entry had a decidedly English appearance; it required notranslation, and read: "_King James the First, Chief of theThron-Diucks_.""We've struck the King's house," said Mackay with a laugh. "The oldskunk and I hev niver agreed, so I hope he doesn't come along now.""I thought he called himself 'James the Second,'" said the Captainslowly.But Stewart would wait no longer. "Staun clear, a'm comin'!" he cried,and his voice rang with shivering distinctness through the air. With ashort rush he threw himself against the wooden barrier; the stouttimbers bent and quivered, but resisted the shock, and from within camea harsh, tearing sound, terminating in a muffled crash, as of somethingfalling heavily. Again and again Stewart acted as a battering ram, butonly vague echoes rewarded his efforts; the logs were evidentlyunusually firmly founded. The noises created by these variousonslaughts--and ultimately we had simultaneously applied all ourenergies without avail--had a most demoralising effect upon us, andafter each attack we waited breathlessly until the echoes had died away.Assuredly, if the Indians were within several miles of us, they couldnot fail to hear the diabolical din we were creating.We had been over an hour at our depredating labours, and I was beginningto wish I had never sanctioned the expedition; then the indefatigableStewart made a discovery. We had hitherto neglected to examine thebarricaded holes which seemingly served as windows, deeming them toosecurely fastened for our nefarious purpose; they were closed from theinside, and were too high in any case to be within reach of Stewart'simpetuous shoulder, but now our strong man had but lightly pressed thewindow-guard, and behold! it swung open. His hearty "hurroo" drew myattention."For heaven's sake shut up!" I whispered angrily. But Mackay made evenmore noise by exploding into a loud laugh, which resounded weirdly overthe tree-tops."Good fur you, Stewart!" he cried; "now we're right."The Captain, like myself, was not very enthusiastic over our night'sexploit. "Let's get it over quickly, boys," he said. "Give me a lift-up,Stewart." But Stewart had reserved to himself the honour of first entry,and was even then dangling midway through the aperture, and squirminghis way forward vigorously. The opening was very small, not more thantwo feet square, and as I watched my companion scrambling in, I thoughtthat if the level of the floor was lower than the surface without, whichis usually the case with Indian huts, considerable difficulty might beexperienced in making an exit! Stewart, however, was apparently troubledby no unpleasant anticipations, and soon a crash, followed by anejaculation of much fervour, heralded his arrival on the other side ofthe stoutly-timbered wall."Are you there?" cried Mackay, preparing to follow."Whaur did ye think a wis?" came the somewhat surly reply, and thedoughty warrior's voice sounded almost sepulchral as it floated out ofthe darkness. Then he added enticingly, "Come in, ma man, come in, an'bring a licht wi' ye, fur it's pitch dark, an' an' awfu' smelliferous."To me the insinuating tone of my comrade's voice sounded suspicious, butneither Mackay nor the Captain noticed anything unusual."I'll be with you in a jiff, Stewart, old man," said the formergentleman, vainly striving to get his head and shoulders through theaperture. But his body was somewhat rotund and made rather a tight fitin the narrow entrance. "Push, ye beggars!" he gasped, and the Captainand I went to his assistance, only to see him jerk suddenly forward anddisappear with a clatter inside, while Stewart's voice spluttered out infirm protest, "Come awa' in, ma man, an' dinna block up the ventilator."For some minutes longer I waited in suspense, while Mackay struck matchafter match and spoke never a word, and Stewart kept up a continual flowof mysterious grunts and sundry forcible expletives. I had a small pieceof candle in my pocket, and this I lit; then, with the Captain's aid, Ithrust my head through the window and surveyed the interior. Mackayquickly seized the piece of tallow from my hand, and held it aloft, andthen I saw what had baffled the usually fluent descriptive powers of theworthy Stewart and his fiery companion. The room was bare save for thepresence of several shelves roughly built up in the centre of the floorand reaching almost to the roof, and on each of these shelves a massiveoblong box rested, the sides of which were heavily inlaid with silver orsome similar metal. The whole structure presented an appearance notunlike a Chinese pagoda in miniature; the meaning of the arrangement wasmore than I could understand. The noises which we had at first heard hadevidently been occasioned by the uppermost cases falling from theirresting-places, for Stewart was examining with much interest one ofseveral of the strange receptacles which were lying on theheavily-logged floorway. As I gazed in mute wonder on the extraordinaryscene, I was quickly made aware that a wonderfully-powerful odourpervaded the room. It assailed my nostrils and my eyes, causing me tochoke and blink, and finally withdraw my head into the pure air."It's the thickest perfume I've iver struck," groaned Mackay, and hestaggered against the weird-looking pagoda.I heard a shuffling rattle, and looking in a second time, saw thespidery monument sway, then fall with a dull hollow crash, scatteringits curious freight in all directions. At the same time a yell fromStewart all but shattered my little remaining nerve, and he came leapingwildly across the fallen boxes towards the narrow egress."A'm comin' oot!" he bellowed; then Mackay, forcing up behind, andmaking strenuous endeavours to preserve his usual _sangfroid_, saidweakly, "I guess I need a breath of air also, boys."To make matters worse, the Captain, who had been warily prospectingaround, now came rushing back, gesticulating energetically. "The wholetribe is quite close, and comin' fur us!" he announced in a loud whisperwhen he came near. Here was a predicament. The two eager individualswhose heads were thrust appealingly out of the window, groaned inanguish, for they could not get out without assistance, struggle as theymight."You had better stay right where you are, boys, and we'll come in too,"I said to them hurriedly, for the shuffling of many snowshoes nowreached my ears, and there was no time to effect a rescue."Heaven knows what's goin' to be the end o' this," muttered the Captainas he swung his lank frame through the opening. It took some time forhim to wriggle inside, and then I attempted the acrobatic performancenecessary to make an entry. I was just a little late, for, lookingaround before making the final duck inwards I saw a number ofwild-looking figures approaching quickly over the snow. The moon thenencountered a belt of dense, fleecy clouds, and a welcome darknessenveloped the landscape just as Stewart, with a grunt of satisfaction,tugged me ingloriously into the odoriferous realms from which he hadbeen so desperately anxious to escape, and shut the heavy barricade. Afew minutes passed, during which time we were all but stifled by thepungent air; then our miseries were forgotten in the dangerthat threatened. Snowshoes hissed and skidded around our shelter, anddeep, guttural exclamations in the Chinook tongue sounded on everyside. And as I pieced together the various monosyllabic utterances, Irefrained from translating them to my companions, although I had a dimidea that both Stewart and Mackay had fully decided that, whatever itmight be, the strange structure in which they were was certainly nostorehouse for dried caribou or salmon.We had been barely five minutes in the dismal room, yet the time seemedan age. The Indians contented themselves with circling round each housein turn, keeping several yards distant from them, for a reason which wasnow painfully apparent to me. I could stand it no longer. "Boys," Isaid, "we've got to get out of this, lively, for the Indians willprobably patrol about till sunrise, and half an hour will just aboutfinish me.""An' me," groaned Mackay.The Captain, however, was not satisfied. "Look here, boys," he said, "Idon't hitch on to yer meaning a bit. Are the Injuns afraid to go intotheir houses, or--I'm hanged if I can make out thish yer circus. Is thisan Injun village, or is it not?" he demanded.There was no need to hide it from him further. "No, Captain," I replied,"it's not.""Then what place is this?" he asked slowly; and Stewart answered him indolorous tones--"A graveyaird, Cap'n--an Injun graveyaird."So it was. The cases contained but the dust of long-deceased warriors,wrapped in blankets which were impregnated with a sickly-smelling scentmade by the Indians from the roots of certain plants. In the darkness Icould not see the Captain's face, and for some moments he said nothing,then he spoke, musingly: "James the First" said he, "yes, I might haveknown, for it is James the Second who is now Chief of the Thron-Diucks."The swishing of snowshoes again sounded ominously near. We waited tillthe Indians had passed; then Stewart, swinging open the barricade,Mackay scrambled up, and was shot forward into the snow with ourcombined effort. "Hurry up, boys," he cried, when he had recoveredhimself; "they are at the end, and are just turning to come back."Breathing heavily, Stewart was next propelled into the open; then camemy turn, the Captain being the tallest, waiting to the last; but tall ashe was he could only reach his head and a part of his shoulder throughthe window, for the floorway was sunk considerably. No time was to belost. With a howl, Stewart gripped the outstretched arm, Mackay theexposed shoulder, and both pulled as if for dear life. Despite the needfor silence, the Captain was but human."Howlin' tarnation, you're twistin' my neck off!" he yelled, as he wasyanked like a sportive fish on to the glistening snow."Run, ye deevils, run!" roared Stewart, himself setting the example.There was much need. Scarcely twenty yards away fully a score of tall,bemuffled warriors were speeding towards us, silent and grim, like araging Nemesis. On the impulse of the moment I discharged my revolver asa signal to Mac to move ahead; then with a wholesome fear in our heartswe set a course for the camp, where Dave, aroused by the revolver shot,was baying loud and fiercely, and skipped over the interveningsnow-wreaths at an uncommonly lively rate.Whether the Indians followed us, or whether they remained to make goodthe work of our desecrating hands, we never learned, but I rather thinkthey waited to rebuild the tombs of their ancestors. They were certainlynot in evidence when we overtook Mac, and we gave a simultaneous shoutof relief."Whaur's the cariboo ye wis gaun tae fetch?" asked that gentleman in anoutburst of righteous indignation."Say nae mair, Mac. Say nae mair," eloquently pleaded Stewart, grippinga rope and feverishly assisting the sleigh on its onward progress. "Ifyou had suffered what I hae suffered this nicht----" His voice failedhim, and Mac simmered down at once."Was it as bad's that?" said he commiseratingly."We'd better keep going all night, boys," Mackay hastily remarked, witha furtive glance behind. "And to-morrow," he added, more cheerfully,"we'll have a good blow-out at Skookum Gulch." And so it came to pass.[Illustration: PAN-WASHING IN SKOOKUM GULCH.]THE FINDING OF "GOLD BOTTOM" CREEKAs the season advanced the ground hardened so that with our primitivefire-burning methods we could barely thaw more than eighteen inches ofgravel in the short day, and even this occasioned tedious labour. Thedepth of bedrock was sixteen feet, and the frost had penetrated farbeyond this level, so that our tunnelling operations along the line ofthe wash proceeded very slowly indeed. The miners around had begun toflock into Dawson to frequent the saloons and gamble away theirhardly-earned gold, all declaring that it was too cold to work--thethermometer registered 25 degrees below zero--and soon Skookum Gulch wasalmost deserted. "Cap." Campbell and "Alf" Mackay alone remained to keepus company.My knowledge of the Chinook tongue had been of considerable service tome, and the Indians inhabiting the upper Thron-Diuck valley occasionallyvisited our camp, bringing many presents of dried salmon and caribou,all of which Mac and Stewart accepted with voluble thanks. Then one day"King James," the chief of the tribe, paid us the honour of a call."Why you dig, Mis'r Mac?" he interrogated, apparently much mystified tosee us excavating the ground."Fur GOLD, ye heathen," howled Stewart, popping his head above theshaft.King James did not understand the full significance of the remark, butsmiled indulgently when I translated it, and solemnly inclined his headtowards the speaker."You squaw," he said, "you squaw to Mis'r Mac." Which meant that heconsidered Stewart somewhat presumptuous in addressing a chief of theThron-Diucks.After much talk had been indulged in, King James appeared to realisethat we were really searching for gold, and had no idea of carrying awayor shifting the course of his river; and his dry old face spread out ina broad grin when I explained that much gold, in our country, wasequivalent to many squaws. Suddenly he turned and strode solemnlytowards his sleigh, which was guarded by several richly-robed squaws andhalf a dozen youthful warriors; and after groping among the bearskinrugs for some time he came back to me, displaying in his greasy palm abeautiful specimen of alluvial gold: it was large and flat, with smoothsurface and water-worn edges; it must have weighed at least threeounces. I gazed in bewilderment; the Indians rarely looked for gold,which to them was not even so valuable as silver, and the latter metalthey used only for making ornaments. Mac and Stewart were soon by myside, and while we examined the specimen with undisguised interest, KingJames lit his pipe--a former present from myself--and puffed leisurely,eyeing me the while with a half-amused expression."What think o' that, Mis'r Mac?" he asked at length."It's good stuff, King James," I strove to answer in his language, andwith a sigh I offered it back. My surprise was great when he waved itaside right royally, and placing his grimy hand on my shoulder in quitea fatherly manner, he spoke out several sentences rapidly."Hold hard, King James," I cried. "I cannot follow you if you talk inthat fashion. Come into my tent and have some 'baccy."He smiled benignly, and spoke a few words to the sleigh attendants, whoimmediately unhitched the dogs and proceeded to build a fire near athand; then he followed me to my camp and ensconced himself by the stove.I still carried the nugget in my hand, but obeying the old chief'sdirections, I now placed it in a bottle with my other specimens and satdown beside him. Stewart meanwhile turned his attention to culinarymatters, and while the billies boiled, King James and I conversedearnestly on matters dear to the Indian heart.He was no lover of the white men who had invaded his domain and drivenhis people to seek the refuge of the mountain fastnesses, and heintimated plainly enough that he should not be sorry to see Dawson Cityspeedily deserted by the white intruders. As for gold, the idea of grownmen seeking for the yellow metal aroused his keen amusement, and he wasvery incredulous about my statements as to its value in the wigwams ofthe white people. After the subject of his woes had been gone into atgreat length, and our hearty sympathies enlisted, he remained silent fora time as if absorbed in thought. Then his eyes surveyed the miningimplements and firearms in the tent, and finally rested upon my nuggetcollection with a newly-awakened sparkle of interest."You come wi' me, Mis'r Mac," he said thoughtfully, after a long pause,"Heap big bear on Thron-Diuck; you come wi' King James----"I shook my head vigorously; we were not very anxious to shoot big gameat that time, but his hospitality would not be denied."Me show you whar big gold come from. Me show you Gold Bottom," hehastened to add: "too much gold for white men in Dawson--me show _you_,Mis'r Mac."Stewart was so astounded at the old chief's last words, spoken in brokenEnglish, that he nearly chopped his fingers with the axe instead of thesolidified flour he was preparing to bake."I'll gang," he bellowed."An' me," growled Mac, who, like his comrade, had only understood thelast sentence.King James smoked stolidly for a few moments, then patted Stewartpatronisingly on the back. "You good squaw," he said, gazing at thehalf-baked flour with much approval, "you come wi' me."The appellation "squaw" by no means pleased the fiery Stewart, and hewould have burst out angrily had I not restrained him."Yes, I guess we'll go with you, King James," I replied. "I want to seeGold Bottom Creek badly, and I don't anticipate any evil effects fromtoo much gold." And so the compact was made, and old "Leatherskin," asStewart promptly dubbed him, smiled softly when I explained to him theworkings of my big game rifle, and went into a transport of delight onbeing presented with a serviceable Colt revolver and a box ofcartridges. Suddenly his face clouded, and he said anxiously--"Only you come, Mis'r Mac; only you an' squaws."I restrained my companions with difficulty from rushing at him to chokeback the objectionable epithet; then an idea struck me. I wanted "Cap"Campbell and Mackay, my adjoining burrowers in the frozen gravel, toaccompany me; they had shared with us the plodding uncertainty of thingsat Skookum Gulch, and I wanted them to reap some of the benefitsattached to the discovery of the mysteriously-famed "Gold Bottom" beforethe district was rushed. I could hardly doubt that King James'sinformation was correct, and the specimen given me was sufficient foreven the most incredulous-minded person. The inducement was very realindeed, but the chief would only allow Mis'r Mac an' squaws."All right, King James," I said, "but I have two more squaws." He eyedme with a look that was fast changing from one of mere friendliness toone of much respect."You great man, Mis'r Mac," he grunted. "Four squaws? Ugh!"When he saw the brawny giants that Mac hastily called in, his surprisewas unbounded. "Good squaws," he chuckled."What in tarnation does the old skunk mean?" said Mackay, and Campbell'sanger was rising visibly."Look here, boys," I said. "King James has told me of a creek that islined with gold, and this is a sample"--I showed them the specimenreceived. "He asks me to go and take charge of the lot, but only myselfand squaws. You had better be squaws for once in your lives. _Savez?_"They did "_savez_," and made every effort to show their cordiality tothe King, who appreciated their advances with tolerant grace, butgrinned expansively when he saw their well-filled cartridge-belts.Stewart made a triumphant success of his cooking that day, and in honourof the occasion he filled the little "doughboys" with pieces of driedapricots and peaches, and, indeed, everything in that line our larderafforded. So luxurious a repast did he provide that King James sighedregretfully when he rose to go."You come to-morra', Mis'r Mac!" he cried when he was rolled up in hissleigh blankets, like, as Mac said, an Egyptian mummy."Right!" I answered, waving him goodbye. But he had not finished."Be sure bring cook squaw," he murmured contentedly.The long whips cracked and the dogs bounded forward; the shriek of thesleigh-runners effectually drowned Stewart's vehement curses; and theKing departed.Next morning we started out for the Indian camp. Mac and Stewart had thetents struck, and it with the blankets packed in neat rolls on oursleigh soon after sunrise. Our rather small store of flour and othernecessaries found ample space on the same conveyance, and to this loadDave was harnessed. Campbell and Mackay did not delay us; they were upbetimes and had their dog-sleigh ready with ours. The temperature thismorning registered 30 degrees below zero, and even while we were engagedtying the sleigh ropes, long icicles formed at our chins and drippedfrom our eyelashes."Are you ready, boys?" I cried to my freshly-acquired squaws."Right!" they responded with one voice."Gee up, Dave," said Mac, and with a bound and a shriek our sleigh ledthe way towards the Klondike's unknown source. We were not muchconcerned about leaving our properties on Skookum Gulch; it was notlikely that any one would "jump" our claims; the weather was too coldfor the tender feet of Dawson to venture out around the creeks. Soon weleft the Dome in the distance behind, and swiftly we crashed through thepowdered snow and blown ice on the main river. No white man, at thistime, had explored the head waters of the Klondike. In the earlierseason I had attempted the task, but was repelled by the deep gorges andgrim cañons that marked the river's channel for many miles when near anoutlying spur of the "Rockies." Now we forced a trail far beyond myfurthest travel, tracing here and there the track of the old chief'ssleigh where the runners had cut deep through the blistered ice. Ourvisages were soon framed in icicles, and our cheeks rendered stiff by athin film, as of glass, which caused us much pain. Mac and Stewartambled beside the staggering dogs, occasionally helping them overobstacles and badly-blown patches. For once they were forced to march insilence, for their mouths were sealed as if by iron bands.The Grand Cañon was entered soon after midday, and the majestic powersof old King Frost had so metamorphosed the dark gorge that we made ourtrail over the frozen torrent almost nervously. The great stalactitesand dripping ice cones shut out the sky completely, and we forged aheadin a vague eerie shadow reflected from the translucent pillars. Here andthere the roar of the flood echoed from giant clefts in the ice, andcaused the glassy walls to quiver and crackle; then again came theoppressive calm, broken only by the dull rumble of the rushing torrentfull fifty feet below.It is impossible to picture the grandeur of an Alaskan cañon when theelements hold it in thrall; there is nothing like it in the whole world.Nevertheless, we were not sorry when we emerged into the comparativelyopen country beyond, and picked up afresh the track of King James'ssleigh which we had been unable to trace in the gorge. Our destinationcould not now be far distant, for the frowning peaks of the Rockiesloomed directly ahead, and the valley was rapidly becoming lost in theminor ranges that appeared; we were surely near the mystic source of thegolden Klondike. The dogs never slackened their trot, though now andthen they staggered and stumbled over large ridges of blistered ice,which cut their paws cruelly. Our moccasins were being quickly reducedto shreds, and our clothing generally had become stiff with the frostand rent in great holes by contact with the brittle, flaking ice. Fewwhite men would have dreamed of making such a journey on such a day. Icontented myself with that reflection, though probably the miners intheir snug huts at Dawson would have dubbed us colossal fools forventuring so far back into the Indian territory; but gold was always anirresistible incentive."I reckon," said Campbell, coming up from behind, and grimacingfrightfully as he spoke, while the ice shivered on his face with theeffort, "this is not much of a picnic, is it?"It was some minutes before I could reply, and while I strove to coax themuscles of my mouth to relax without doing serious injury to myfeatures, Stewart's hoary visage shook itself clear of its icy sheathwith a crackling, splintering sound, and his voice rang out--"I see the Injun camp! Hurroo! D----!" The last expression was given ina most sorrowful tone as he felt the blood trickle on his cheeks andfreeze into icy appendages."You've got to think a lot before speaking in this country," Isympathised, but he would not open his mouth again.Rounding a bluff, we saw, nestling in the shadow of a great pine-forest,an array of mud huts and tepees covered with caribou skins. Many fireswere blazing in the vicinity, fed lavishly with logs drawn from thewooded slope behind. A number of King James's subjects superintendedoperations with unmoved faces; it was a routine to which they had longbecome accustomed--for bear-fires were very necessary indeed in theseparts; Bruin had not yet reconciled himself to his winter slumber, and,as I have noted, the Klondike valley was infested with various speciesof his kind.With a sigh of thankfulness I signalled to Mac to draw up alongside thelargest fire, and he needed no second bidding. A few moments more and wewere all eagerly thawing ourselves before the blaze. Even the dogscrept as close as the burning logs allowed, and warmed their poor frozenbodies on all sides, turning continually, as if on a revolvingtoast-rack. From the most imposing hut now came rushing towards us KingJames, with numerous squaws; and while the King congratulated meeffusively on my safe arrival, the squaws beamed coquettishly on mycompanions, who felt in no wise complimented by their attentions."They tak' us fur squaws, Stewart!" howled Mac, more in sorrow than inanger; then I heard them both with much deliberation calculate out thevalue of the Queen squaw's dress as she stood by them, speaking words ofwelcome in a tongue they could not understand."It's a rale guid beaver," I heard Mac say."An' what a bonny silver-tip cloak," burst in Stewart."An' the moccasins," continued the first speaker, "are faur ow'r guidfur an Injun tae wear."At this juncture I turned anxiously; I thought it very necessary."For heaven's sake, Mac," I said, "leave the squaw's beavers andmoccasins alone. We'll get murdered if old King James----""Wha's touchin' their belangin's?" interrupted Mac indignantly; butdespite his righteous outburst, I knew that he and his doughty comradewould have had little qualms about appropriating the bonny beavers andmoccasins also. Their logic was vague, but conclusive enough to satisfythemselves. However, with much grumbling they unharnessed Dave, andstarted to erect the tent in a sheltered spot, Campbell and Mackayhaving already got their smaller canvas home fixed up."It's fair disgracefu'," muttered Mac, as he pulled on the guy-rope,"tae think o' livin' near Injuns! We're comin' faur doon in the worldsurely.""Ye're richt there," spoke Stewart mournfully; "bit, man, did ye eversee sic a bonnie beaver?"Next morning, when the dim grey light was beginning to appear, we setout to explore the creek containing "too much gold." King James's sleighled the trail, for which I was truly thankful. The dangerous nature ofthe route from the Indian camp was all too apparent. Miniature glaciershung perilously over each mountain ridge, and formed a sight well fittedto unnerve any man but an Indian; and when we crawled over their glassysurfaces, and slid down on the "other" side, it seemed to me that wewere running risks enough for all the gold in Klondike. We had not gonevery far, however, before King James drew up his dogs in the bed of adeep chasm that traced directly from an enormous ice-field overhead. Ilooked around and saw the frozen channel of the Thron-Diuck about ahundred yards below; the King had taken us by a "short cut" over themountains rather than follow the much easier route by way of the mainriver. For a moment I thought that he had purposely meant us to lose ourbearings, but he soon dispelled that fear."Gold Bottom here, Mis'r Mac," he said. "You dig." He measured about afour-feet length on the snow, meaning, I suppose, that we should findbedrock at that level. "You find much gold, Mis'r Mac, too muchgold----""Hold hard!" I interrupted; "I guess we'll deserve all we get. This isthe devil's own part of the world we've struck."King James grinned incredulously, but kept silence; and arranging hissleigh rugs, he whipped up his long line of dogs and sped back over thetrail we had just traversed. We watched him till his sleigh, careeringdangerously, rushed down into the valley beyond. The mining instinctsof Campbell and Mackay now overcame their dislike of our chill anduncompromising surroundings.[Illustration: GOLD-BOTTOM CREEK.]"It looks likely country," said Campbell, "and I shouldn't wonder ifthat glacier has worn down quite a lot of gold."We were not long in pitching our tents and building several fires tothaw off the icicles that clung to our faces; then we felt much moreenthusiastic over our prospects. The timber was plentiful, and close athand; we were far indeed from the madding crowd."We'll make a start, boys," I said; "we'll see whether old Leather-skinspoke correctly."My two companions were rather disconsolately surveying the scene."Too much gold!" muttered Mac in derision. "No vera likely. It wad tak'hundreds o' thoosands o' pounds tae pey me fur ma sufferin's in thisGod-forsaken country."All day long we kept great logs burning over the frozen gravel silted upon the edge of the channel. Slowly we excavated the "dirt" in fragments,picking energetically at it after each fire had been cleared away. Theicy body of the creek had evidently long since been formed, for not adrop of water flowed beneath; and after sinking a few feet we came to alevel where the frozen mass contracted from the old river-bed, leaving aclear dry space in which a man could almost stand upright. We at onceabandoned our shaft, and crawled into the strange cavern formed. Thegravel over which the torrent had flowed was dry, and hard as flint. Wehad reached bedrock on the true channel of the stream, and with waterstill flowing overhead! A yet unfrozen fluid gurgled in the heart of thegreat ice column above; the effect was wonderfully beautiful."I guess we'll stick to the shaft, boys," said Mackay; "this looksuncanny," and he scrambled out; the idea of working underneath theflowing stream was too much for him, though he was a veteran miner.Campbell and I soon followed his example, leaving Mac and Stewart, whowere not easily daunted, to survey the wonders of Nature at theirleisure. They at once commenced picking the frozen channel, and thethud! thud! of the blows came to our ears, as we stood by the fireabove, as the sonorous notes of a deep-toned bell. Already the murkygloom of an Alaskan night was fast closing over, though it was yet buttwo o'clock in the afternoon. Thud! thud! thud! went the pickaxes below,and I marvelled at the persistence of my companions, for I knew theycould make little impression on the flinty sands.Suddenly the echoes ceased, and the sounds of a wordy altercationrumbled up towards us; a few minutes later Mac popped his head out ofthe shaft and beckoned me mysteriously, then disappeared again.Wonderingly I let myself down through the narrow aperture and wriggledinto the cavern. A strange sight met my gaze. A lighted stump of candlewas stuck in the ground, and its pale light, reflected against theglistening roof, gave the scene a somewhat unearthly appearance. Stewartwas kneeling on the gravel, examining carefully a flat, pebble-shapedstone; beside him was heaped quite a number of similar fragments, andthese were evidently the results of my companions' labours, for manyhollows in the channel showed where the pebbles had been extracted. WhenI entered, Mac was feverishly rubbing one of the pieces against hismoccasined leg."What kind o' stane dae ye ca' that?" he asked eagerly, handing hisprize to me."I've tell't him it's ironstane," broke in Stewart in a convinced toneof voice, "but Mac aye likes tae be contrairy."The specimen given me was a rough and rusty-looking pebble, very muchwater-worn. At first glance it certainly looked like ironstone, and itsweight proved it to be either of that nature or--I dared not hoped thealternative. I took my sheath knife and endeavoured to scrape the edges,but they were hard as flint."A kent it was ironstane," grumbled Stewart, yet I was not satisfied. Iheld the specimen close to the candle-flame for several minutes until itwas heated throughout, then I again tried my knife on the edges. Theeffect was astounding; the rusty iron coat peeled off as mud, and lo! anugget of shining gold was brought to view.With a howl of delight Stewart started up, cracking his head against thecrystal ceiling in his haste. "Gold!" he shouted, and grabbed at thehandful of stones he had collected. "Mak' some mair," he said.But there was no need to doubt further; every rusty-coloured pebbleunearthed was in truth a fine alluvial specimen of the precious metal,and when scraped each tallied in every characteristic with King James'snugget. The iron coating was but a frozen mud cement which had formedover the irregularities of surface with vice-like tenacity. The bed ofthe creek was indeed gold bottomed; the King had not stated wrongly.Campbell and Mackay soon joined us; they had become alarmed at myprolonged absence."This beats Bonanza and El Dorado hollow," was the first individual'scomment."Well, I'm jiggered!" feebly murmured Mackay, gazing blinkingly around.The light danced and shone on the yellow fragments, and sparkled on thecrystal dome. The sight was truly gorgeous. Even the fabled Aladdin'scave could hardly have surpassed the splendours of that Alaskan icyvault.It was plain to us that the depth of "pay gravel" could not be more thana few inches at most; the steep declivity of the channel was a sureproof of that fact, and our "find" would not, therefore, take long towork out. It promised, however, to be the richest strike in the Klondikevalley. The gold being so close to the mother lode, which was,unfortunately, covered by the glacier, was all of a coarse nature; noneof the pieces collected came under the pennyweight limit, and onespecimen we computed to be at least five ounces....Such is the record of one of our prospecting trips to the glacierstreams of the Upper Klondike, and "Gold Bottom Creek" from that timeoccupied an honoured place in every miner's reference book.THE PERILS OF THE TRAILAll through that dread winter no news reached civilisation from thefrozen El Dorado, no communication had been established with the greatmushroom city of the far Nor'-West, and only the wildest sort ofspeculation could be indulged in as to the fate of the pioneerinhabitants of the Klondike valley. Only too late was the knowledgeforced upon the almost fanatical gold-seekers that the iron grip of anArctic winter was upon them, effectually barring retreat and sealing thenarrow gates of the country against all further expeditions from theoutside. They had lived on in the steadfast belief that the "GreatAmerican nation" would send in supplies in good time to prevent anylikelihood of starvation. But so ignorant was the world regarding thenature of the northern land that many companies continued even at thattime in Seattle and San Francisco to outline in the press their plansfor sending stores to Dawson in the "coming" winter--this in November,when the elements had already a vice-like grip of the country.Several expeditions really started, but so ludicrous were theirequipments that they without exception failed to penetrate beyond thecoastal barriers--the grim old Chilcoot and the murderous Skagway trail.And so in the "promised land" the chill November blasts were hushed andthe deadly quiet of a December frost reigned supreme. The majority ofthe miners worked out on the creeks, but when the intense cold forcedthem to cease their labours they flocked into Dawson and idly frequentedthe saloons, bragging of their riches to their less favoured comrades,and cursing the ungodly nature of the country in forcible language.At this time very few had more than three months' provisions, and themajority were at their last bag of flour. The stores would sell nothingunless at fabulous prices. Everything commanded one dollar a pound. Evensalt, that cheap but necessary commodity, had the same value. Bakingpowder was unpurchasable--there being none. Before long one hundreddollars was offered and refused for a sack of rolled oats. Therestaurants for a time supplied "meals" at exorbitant charges, yet oneby one they had to give out for want of supplies. The end came whenseven dollars was asked and given freely for a meagre portion of baconand beans--the staple food of the Arctics. Only a few days did thisestablishment--"Dawson's Last Hope"--hold out, and then the familiarlegend, "No supplies," was posted on the logged doorway. It was onlythen that the real state of affairs was impressed upon the unthinkingpeople.Many tragedies were enacted in that northern mining camp during theweeks that followed. A kind of panic prevailed. Short rations was therule, and starvation only too frequent. There seemed nothing but deathahead for all. On short rations, with the thermometer averagingforty-five below zero! who could view such a prospect with equanimity?Thefts of goods were often attempted, and almost invariably death byrevolver bullet was the end of the poor hungry would-be thief's career,for the necessaries of life were more strictly guarded than gold. Goldcould not buy them. Many would have given their all gladly for a sack offlour. Long before Christmas all work was suspended. The population tookto their log-huts, and barricaded every nook and cranny in vainendeavour to keep out the cold. Daylight appeared at ten o'clock in themorning, and night closed over the camp soon after three. The "city"seemed deserted, all but for the presence of a few dog-sleighs, whichwere constantly employed in carrying timber from the mountain-side. Thestrong men who had dared the elements and dragged the gold from theunwilling soil now gave way utterly. The keen air whetting theirappetites rendered their existence on short rations a long-drawn-outagony. The weaker element soon fell ill, and then a reign of terrorbegan. Fever became prevalent, and the little cemetery soon had to beextended to accommodate the many victims to its fury.A "roll-up" of the miners was by unanimous consent held to reason outthe dangerous situation, and it was decided as a last desperate resourceto attempt the long overland route to Dyea across the treacherousChilcoot Pass. Until the arrival of my party over the ice none haddreamed that such a journey was practicable. During the heart of anArctic winter, to march seven hundred miles over ice and unfathomedsnows! The idea seemed absurd, yet it now became the only hope of lifeto all. That "roll-up" is pictured clearly before me now, and neveragain do I expect to be present at a more cruelly dramatic gathering.Starvation showed plainly on every face; each white frosted visage wasseamed and furrowed as if by a load of care. They were indeed a motleycrowd, comprising representatives of all nationalities. To me fell thequestionable honour of leadership. I was supposed to know the valley ofthe Yukon better than any present, nearly all of whom had entered byway of St. Michael's."All right, boys," I said, in answer to their request, "my party willmake the trail for you as far as Big Salmon River. Then Major Walsh maybe able to advise us what to do."And so the strange company began its long and deadly march. Half a dozendog teams headed the column, after which came men pulling their ownsleighs, and at the rear wearily trudged the multitude who carried theirall in packs bound with straps to their shoulders. It was a strange andpitiable spectacle at the start; what would it be at the finish?The Stewart River was reached in four days, and here the "blown" ice wasalmost insurmountable. It piled up in great blistering sheets, theelevations in some places exceeding a height of twenty feet. Over theseobstacles the dog-sleighs crashed, breaking a way for the long trailinghuman caravan. Moccasins were cut into shreds, and clothing soon becametattered and torn. The thermometer had now dropped to fifty degreesbelow zero, and many became frost-bitten. Not a few lost the use oftheir arms, and marble-hued noses were common indeed.Sometimes I would get well ahead of the main party, and from aconvenient point watched them approach and pass. A stranger sight couldnot be imagined. The staggering line of dogs came first; over theirlowered heads the long whips cracked, and the poor brutes boundedforward with nerve and life in every motion. Then the wearysleigh-pullers passed in solemn array, shoulders bent and bodies leaningforward. Their sleighs were pulled along to the accompaniment of theharsh grinding sound emitted from the iron runners on the frozen snow.Lastly, the "packers" straggled in Indian file, and they were surely asight to be viewed with mingled feelings. Tall men, short men, stoutmen--and they were few--and thin men followed in miscellaneous order.Some were lame, and limped painfully; some had their heads bandaged,many wore nose coverings, and a few were minus the nose altogether.Strange it was to see at intervals, when this almost weird processionlagged to the rear, how strenuously they would endeavour to recoverground, and when with one accord they broke into a run the spectacleoffered would have been laughable had it not been so seriously, so trulya race for life.[Illustration: DAWSON CITY.]Salmon River was reached at last. Five men had died on the trail and twowere seriously ill, though they dragged themselves along, helpedoccasionally by the dog-sleighs. Here I formally gave over myresponsible charge to Campbell and Mackay, and having been entrustedwith mails and despatches for the coast, with barely a halt pushed onahead with Mac and Stewart. Our stores had diminished greatly beyond mycalculations, and it was evident that an extreme effort must be made toincrease our rate of travel. Yet despite our utmost endeavours, when weentered upon the snowy wastes of Marsh Lake we pulled a sleigh on whichreposed a few furs, a bag of mineral specimens, and about as much flouras would make one good square meal.For the last several days our progress had been severely hampered by theincreasing depth and softness of the snow filling the valley of theYukon as we approached nearer the dreaded pass. Our daily march sinceleaving the northern capital had rarely fallen below twenty-eight miles,until the unfrozen White Horse Rapids had stayed our advance and causedus to make a wide _détour_; but now, do what we might in oursemi-famished condition, we could barely travel twenty miles in as manyhours, and full eighty miles yet intervened between us and the sea. Onthis day we had been on the trail since sunrise, and the darkeningshadows of night were already beginning to creep over the billowywastes, though it was but two hours after noon."We are near the end of the lake, boys," I shouted encouragingly, as Inoticed the failing efforts of my companions. "We must try and reachTagash River to-night."Mac groaned dismally, and Dave emitted a plaintive howl as he struggledin his harness. Then Stewart, who had grown wofully cadaverous of late,stopped and addressed his compatriot."I mind, Mac," said he, "that there used to be an Injun village aboothere.""I hae a disteenct recollection o' the place," returned Mac shortly,bending to his labours afresh."We are passing that same village now," I cried cheerily. "That makesten miles since our last halt."The sleigh stopped with a jerk; half a dozen log-huts with a like amountof totem poles, were plainly observable among the dense timber on shore."Them Injuns must have something for eating in they houses," spoke Macthoughtfully, gazing at the rude structures intently."But we have nothing to barter, and we know they won't sell," I broke inimpatiently.He made no reply to my remark, but turned to Stewart, who was evidentlyin a fit of deep mental abstraction: "What's your idea, Stewart, maman?" he asked insinuatingly, and that individual responded promptly."I am wi' ye, Mac, every time, but I hope it's no' a graveyard like thelast we tackled." They threw down their sleigh-ropes simultaneously, andwere half-way to the village before I had recovered myself."Hold hard!" I roared. "What----"Mac's substantial figure spun round at once. "We'll be back in ameenit," he whispered mysteriously.I loosened Dave from his harness, and hastened after the doughty pair,expecting every instant to hear sounds of deadly strife, but allremained silent as a tomb, and I shuddered with painful recollections. Ifound them cavorting around the largest edifice in the group in a mannerthat under different circumstances would have seemed ludicrous."There's naebody in the hooses," cried Stewart gleefully. "The wholetribe must have gone out moose-hunting."Not infrequently a village is entirely deserted in this way, and Iheaved a sigh of relief. "But they may be back at any time," I said,glancing fearfully round.Mac shrugged his shoulders; "I think, Stewart," he remarked in a mostmatter-of-fact tone, "I think the door is the weakest place after all."I swallowed my scruples at a gulp, and became interested in theproceedings at once. Strangely enough, for the moment we all seemed tohave forgotten how very similarly our first escapade of the kind hadopened.Crash! Mac's broad shoulder butted the barricaded doorway rightponderously, but though the heavy logs quivered and bent, they resistedthe shock. And now Stewart braced himself for the attack, and togetherthey hurled themselves against the wavering supports. There was aresounding echo as the entire structure gave way, and with many chucklesof delight the adventurous couple disappeared within, while I remainedoutside, my rifle at full cock, listening for the tramp of moccasinedfeet that would herald the Indians' return. I heard Mac strike matchafter match, muttering discontentedly the while, and Stewart'sdissatisfied grunts filled me with dismay. Was our depredating raid togo unrewarded?"There's jist the sma'est bit o' caribou ye could imagine in the halehoose," snorted Mac indignantly. "It wis high time the deevils wenthuntin', I'm thinkin'.""Let's try the other hooses," counselled Stewart.At that moment Dave gave a long, low growl, and immediately anindescribable chorus of yells issued from the forest near at hand. Then,to my horror, I perceived numerous dark forms speeding towards me.Instinctively I levelled my rifle, then by an extreme effort of willlowered it again. We were surely in the wrong. "Come on, boys," I cried,"we must run for it.""Haud on till I get that bit o' caribou," murmured Mac desperately.A moment more, and we made a wild burst in the direction of the sleighs,pursued by a number of stalwart warriors, whose vengeful shouts inspiredour failing steps with an unwonted activity."Let's stop and fecht the deevils," implored Mac, as we grabbed theropes of our sadly-light conveyance, and even at that juncture heexamined his stolen piece of caribou with critical interest. "It's no'fit for human use," he protested angrily. "I'm no' goin' to run fornothing."But the yelling horde at our heels made him think better of it, andmuttering sundry maledictions he hitched on to the rushing sleigh, andlumbered manfully alongside his gloomy compatriot. Fear did certainlylend wings to our flight, and by the time we had reached the outletleading to Tagash Lake, our pursuers were far in the rear, the obscuringdarkness probably being much in our favour. And then, as we hastenedover the shelving ice on the connecting river, we beheld a sight thatdrew from us ejaculations of sheer chagrin. A great fire blazed on theshores of the frozen stream, illuminating in the background asolidly-built logged erection, and showing clearly the outlines of agiant Union Jack fastened to a tree close by. Not a soul was in sight,but I could fancy the comfortable group inside the generous dwellingwhiling away the time before a glowing stove or indulging in a luxuriousdinner."It's a Government station," I said drearily. "It must have been puthere just before the ice closed in."We halted for an instant, and gazed wistfully at the snug police camp.Here surely we might obtain some little stores for our urgent needs, buthow dared we ask? The Indians were British subjects, and would indeed betreated with more consideration than we might expect, for it is thepolicy of the Canadian authorities to protect, even to the outsideextreme, the rights of their dusky subjects. Then, again, we had beenlong on the trail, and our clothing was rent and ragged. The policemight judge us by appearances, and then--I did not care to think whatmight happen. Many thoughts flitted through my mind as we stood therehesitatingly, and my worthy companions, by their silence, showed thatthey too were thinking deeply. The unmusical cries of our pursuersjarred on our meditations with seemingly awakening vigour."They've got our trail," I said sadly. "We'd better get along.""Civilisashun be d----d," fervently, if ambiguously, muttered Mac andStewart almost with one voice, and we staggered out into the bleak,snowy plains of Tagash Lake, and pursued a dogged course southward.THE TENT AT CARIBOU CROSSINGIt was midnight before we halted, and then we camped on the middle ofthe frozen lake, and near the entrance to the Big Windy Arm; and here,after a most miserable night, we were forced to abandon the greater partof the stolen venison as being in itself but little satisfying to oururgent needs. We started again before daybreak, steering by compass inthe darkness. Indeed, it was absolutely necessary that we should keepmoving if we would prevent the blood from freezing in our veins. Ourplight was surely an unenviable one, and as we stumbled on through theever-deepening snow, Mac and Stewart cursed the country endlessly inchoice vernacular; and even Dave, struggling desperately in his harness,found opportunity to give his verdict in hoarse, muffled growls of deepdispleasure."We'll bile the first Injun we meet," said Stewart solemnly, afterseveral hours had passed in silence, and he shook his head clear of itsencompassing deposits of frosted snow and ice, and gazed at our meagresleigh-load with pensive eyes."I'm no sae sure that Injun is guid for eatin' ony mair than mummycaribou," rejoined Mac after much thought. "I mind," he continuedruminatively, "o' eatin' snake sausages in Sooth America, an' they werewonderfu' paleetable, but Injun?" He shook his ice-enclustered headdoubtfully. The day was already drawing to a close; the sun had risen atten o'clock, and its short arc in the heavens was almost completed. Thetime at which one usually expects to fortify the inner man had passed ingrim silence, and the darkening shadows were creeping over the billowywhite waste."We must reach Caribou Crossing to-night, boys," I said. "We dare notcamp again on the open lake in case a blizzard gets up and wipes usout."The blackness of night enveloped us completely, and the tinglingsensation in our cheeks warned us that the frost intensity was far belowthe zero scale. Our moccasins sunk through a powdery fleece so crisp,that it crushed like tinder beneath us, and the steel sleigh-runnerswhistled harshly over the sparkling beady surface. The stars twinkledand shone brilliantly, and great streaks of dazzling light shot atintervals across the northern sky; the night effects were indeedsplendid beyond description, yet we were too much engrossed with morepractical matters to wax enthusiastic over astronomical glories.Suddenly the sharp hiss-s of a sleigh reached our ears, then out of thedarkness came the sound of laboured breathing and smothered growls, asof dogs straining under an undue load. Obeying a common impulse oursorely-tried caravan came to a halt, Dave whining piteously and pawingthe ground impatiently, while my companions peered into the nightearnestly, then turned and gazed at me in silence. The hurrying sleighwas fast approaching on a course that would lead it but a few yards toour left. I was on the point of stepping forward to intercept theadvancing dog-team which was now showing dimly in the starlight, whenone of the two men who accompanied it spoke, and his voice soundeddistinctly in the still air."I thought I heard something," said he."What could you hear?" answered his companion gruffly. "There can't beany one nearer than the station at Tagash, and it's far enough off yet,worse luck.""All the same," reiterated the first speaker, "I'm sure I heardsleigh-runners skidding over the snow. It's mebbe some poor devilscoming out from Dawson."They were almost beside us now, and I wondered that we had not beennoticed."You'll remember, Corporal," came the tones of the doubtful one in hard,official accents, "that on no account can I give out any supplies. Ihave my own men to provide for."For the same reason that we had hurried past the station at TagashRiver, I had no desire to bring my party to official notice now; so,inwardly cursing the niggardly captain, I decided to let the team passwithout soliciting relief. It was clearly a Government "outfit" for thebenefit of the men at Tagash. At a jerky trot the four leading dogsswept by us, swaying wildly as they pulled in their traces. Four moredogs followed, then a heavily-laden sleigh came creaking and groaningthrough the snow, the runners sunk deep and churning up clouds of vapourwhich almost hid from view the plump sacks of flour on board. The mencame after at an amble, their faces muffled so that they, apparently,could neither turn to the right nor left. I could scarcely restrain mycompanions at this point from breaking into a vehement denunciation ofthe police captain and his corporal. They would, indeed, have stormedthe sleigh cheerfully, and meted out no gentle treatment to the ownersthereof. With energetic pantomimic gestures I implored them to be calm;the team was fast being swallowed up in the gloom, but before it haddisappeared from our penetrating gaze a broken sentence floated back toour ears: "Pity ... had to leave so much ... Caribou Crossing ... backto-morrow.... D----d Klondikers."For five minutes more we waited in silence, during which time Mac andStewart were effervescing to an alarming climax, then we gave full ventto our joy. "Ho! ho! ho!" laughed my companions. "Pity left so much atCaribou! D----d Klondikers! Ho! ho! ho!" Dave, too, seemed tounderstand the situation, and promptly proceeded to bark out hisappreciation; but his exuberance was too noisy, so it was hurriedlychecked."Get under way, boys," I said, when my henchmen had recovered theirequanimity, "for we'll need to look lively before the trail is blottedout." We had not spoken a word about the matter, yet there existed aperfect understanding between us. If anything edible had been left atCaribou Crossing we were determined to commandeer it.The well-weighted sleigh had made an easily-observable trail; in the dimstarlight the twin furrows formed by the runners glittered and shonelike the yeasty foam from a ship's propeller. We carefully directed theprow of our snow-ship into these well-padded channels, and with renewedenergy forged ahead, thinking longingly of what might await us atCaribou. Soon the shadows on either side of the lake drew nearer andnearer, and the steep, wooded shores of the dreary waterway narrowedinwards, so that the feathery fronds of the stately pine-trees wereplainly discernible; we were approaching the entrance to CaribouCrossing. Five minutes later we had passed through the narrowchannel--it was barely twenty yards across--and were speeding silentlyover the deep drifts of snow which were wreathed in giant masses on thesurface of the frozen lagoon. The hitherto heavily-marked trail nowappeared blurred and indistinct, and the dense forests lining the"crossing" threw a shadow on the track which effectually neutralisedthe vague glimmer of the stars, so that we had literally to feel for thedeep sleigh channels."If I'm spared to come oot o' this," groaned Mac, as he crawled gingerlyon all fours across the drifts, "I'll never speak o' ma sufferin's, fornaebody could believe what I hae endured.""I hae traivelled faur," supplemented Stewart, lifting up his voice inpathetic appeal, "but I've never been sae afflicted."Having now introduced the subject of their woes they proceeded tocomfort one another in well-chosen words of sympathy. "You'll suffer aconsiderable amount more if you don't find the trail soon," I broke inby way of getting their attention more concentrated on the very urgentmatter on hand. But Stewart would have one word more:"I'll mak' a fine moniment tae ye, Mac, ma man," he said with a sigh,adding lugubriously, "puir, puir Mac.""I'll hae yer life for that, ye deevil," roared that irate gentleman,getting to his feet suddenly, and in consequence floundering to thewaist in the chilly wreaths.Again I essayed to interfere. "Seems to me, boys," I said, "that you'dbetter reserve your energy----" A loud bark interrupted my furtherspeech, and Mac immediately bellowed,"Dave has got the trail; come on, Stewart, an' we'll hae a gloriousfeast o' Government stores very soon."I thought he was anticipating over-much, but I took care to say nothingto discourage the pair, who now, side by side, were crawling rapidlyover the snow, tracing a new series of markings which led into the heartof the thick foliage on shore. I followed after my comrades withalacrity, but the drifts were very wide and deep, and I sunk to the neckin their icy folds, and was almost frozen before I managed to extricatemyself."Are you following the trail, boys?" I cried, "or is it a bear track youare tracing up?" They were too much engrossed in their sleuth-houndoperations to notice my inquiry, but as I had reached the shelter of thetimber where the snow was but thinly laid, I now groped my way morequickly forward, and overtook the keen-eyed couple as they stopped shortand emitted a simultaneous howl of delight."Got it! Got it!" they yelled in unison, and Dave made the wooded slopesresound with his deep-mouthed bark."Got what?" I interrogated, when opportunity offered, for nothing butabsolute blackness surrounded us."Licht a match," joyously spoke Mac.Somewhat mystified I struck a sulphur match and held it aloft, and byits sputtering flame I saw before me a 10 × 12 tent, on the roof ofwhich was painted in huge black letters, "N.W.M.P.""We certainly have got it," I said with much satisfaction, "and we'llsee what's inside without delay.""Scotland yet!" roared Stewart, in an ecstasy of delight, performing afew steps of the Highland fling as delicately as his heavily-paddedmoccasins would permit. Mac was more practical; he proceeded to executewhat appeared in the gloom to be a solemn ghost dance, but in reality hewas searching for the "door" end of the tent."Haud yer noise, ye gomeril!" he said shortly, addressing hispirouetting companion, "an' when ye've feenished capering ye'll mebbeget a candle off the sleigh."The candle was quickly forthcoming, and the flap of the tent discovered;it was laced tightly with long strips of caribou hide, and so was noteasily located in the darkness. We were not long in forcing an entry,the board-like canvas was rooted up from the snow where it had frozenfast, several hoary branches were pushed away from the inside wall,then we boldly took possession. At first survey our "find" seemeddisappointing, the tent was almost empty; only a few verydilapidated-looking sacks were piled within, and the dripping iciclesfrom the ridge gave a most frigid aspect to a dismal enough scene. Mac,however, was not discouraged. "There maun be something for eatin' inthey bags," he said cheerfully, which was logic of the clearest nature;then he proceeded to explore their contents, and while thus engagedStewart gathered together some branches and started a bright blaze atthe doorway."There's flour in this ane!" announced Mac joyfully, "an' beans inanither!" he supplemented; then his delighted cries were frequent."We've got a wee thing o' maist everything that's guid," he summed upfinally, issuing out into the ruddy glow of the fire, where the billies,filled with rapidly-melting snow, were fizzling away merrily.The good news affected Stewart visibly. "A'll mak' a gorgeous re-pastthe nicht, ye deevils," said he, "A'll mak' a rale sumshus feast."The keen edge of our appetite was dulled as a preliminary by copiousdraughts of coffee and the remnants of the morning's damper, thenoperations were begun for the "gorgeous feast." Mac obligingly acted ascook's assistant, and chopped off from the solidified contents of thesacks the requisite amount of flour and other ingredients necessary--andI fear many that were not altogether necessary in the strict sense ofthe word, for beans, and flour, and rolled oats, and rice did not seemto me to be a correct combination. But I was a novice in these arts andfeared to speak, and the manufacture of the "sumshus repast" went onapace.The night was far advanced, yet for once on the long dreary march fromDawson we were in no hurry to court slumber, although we had travelledover thirty miles that day. I think Stewart sized up my own thoughtsrather clearly when he said, during a lull in his artistic labours,"What fur should we gang awa' early the morn'? It wad be a rael pity taeleave this mag-nificent camp.""We might wait just a little too long, Stewart," I replied, and visionsof an angry captain and his stalwart followers floated unpleasantlybefore my eyes.It was near midnight when the gurgling billy was lifted from its perchamid the glowing logs, and Stewart gingerly fished from its interior around steaming mass, neatly enclosed in an old oatmeal sack and tied atthe top. With deft fingers its author undid the wrappings, and lo! arubicund pudding of cannon-ball-like aspect greeted our expectantvisions, and was hailed with loud acclamation."Ever see a puddin' like that, Mac?" demanded Stewart, gazing at ittenderly, and his cautious compatriot somewhat sadly replied--"Only aince, Stewart, an' that wis when we found Gold Bottom Creek, an'ye nearly killed King Jamie o' the Thronducks wi' indegestion."The compliment was just a trifle vague, and was regarded with suspicionby the prime conspirator, but he said no more, and we attacked the"puddin'" in silence, and with a vigour borne of many days' travel onshort rations.Despite its heterogeneous nature, Stewart's culinary creation proved averitable triumph to his art; at any rate it quickly disappeared fromview, even Dave's share being rather grudgingly given. Never, since wehad entered the country, had we fared so well, and when coiled up in ourblankets close to the blazing fire, we felt indeed at peace with allmankind--including the police captain. All night long we kept the flamesreplenished, and dreamily gazed at each other through the curling smoke,for our unusual surfeit had banished sleep from our eyes. And but a fewyards away from the burning logs the air was filled with dancing frostparticles that seemed to form a white wall around us, for ourthermometer, hung on a branch near by, registered forty-two degreesbelow zero. The long hours of darkness dragged slowly on, and it wasnearly eleven o'clock in the morning before the faint light of daygradually dispelled the murky gloom, yet still we lolled laggard-like bythe fire, starvation did not force us on this morning, and we had notrested these last six hundred miles. About noon, however, we decided toget up and have breakfast, and after many abortive attempts we succeededin unwinding our bodies from the blankets in which they were swathedlike Egyptian mummies."It wis a gorgeous banquet," ruminated Mac, as he busied himself withthe sleigh and made fast thereon various little sacks appropriated fromthe tent."There's nae man," responded Stewart with eloquence, "kin teach meonything aboot cooking--especially puddens."I now thought it advisable to examine the markings on the snow where thetrail had given us so much trouble on the night before. I could not yetunderstand why a tent and stores should have been left at CaribouCrossing, one of the most gloomy spots throughout the whole course ofthe Yukon. "Be lively with the breakfast, boys," I said, "for I aminclined to think the climate thirty miles further south will behealthier for us to-night." And I made my way out to the edge of theforest.I reached the lakeside without difficulty; the keen frost of thepreceding hours had given a thick crust to the deep snow-driftsintervening; I then made a careful scrutiny of the various sleigh-runnerchannels which were plainly evident, and which united at the point wherewe had to diverge into the wood. A double trail led southward towardsLake Bennet, but a single one only continued its course to Tagashstation. At once the meaning was plain. Two sleighs had started fromBennet station, and the drifts on Caribou proving unduly deterrent, onesleigh load had been temporarily abandoned. I remembered the two teamsof dogs in the sleigh we had met. Everything was clear in an instant."Yes, we'll certainly be healthier in a more southerly latitudeto-night," I said to myself as I turned to go back to my companions. Theenticing odour of an unusually appetising breakfast greeted my nostrils,and brought back a feeling of serene contentment. But my happiness wasshortlived. I had barely reached the camp fire when I became vaguelyconscious of some disturbing element in the air. I listened intently,then faintly sounded the tinkle of sleigh bells in the distance, and nowand again the sharp crack of a dog-whip smote the keen air. There was noneed to explain matters; even Dave whined knowingly, and backedvoluntarily into his harness."Jist oor luck," grumbled Stewart, grabbing the cooked bacon andthrusting it into one of the billies."It's a blessed thing," quoth Mac, philosophically, "that we had such amagnee----""Are you ready, boys?" I interrupted. The bells sounded sharply now, andI could hear the irascible captain cursing on the dogs."I'm staunin' by the ingines," grunted Mac."There's naething left," said Stewart, "unless we tak' the tent.""Then full speed ahead," I cried; "we'll camp somewhere near the head ofLake Bennet, to-night."With a sharp jerk the sleigh bounded forward, keeping the shelter of thetimber for the first few hundred yards, then sweeping into the open atthe entrance to Lake Bennet, we forced a trail towards Lake Linderman atan unusually rapid rate.ACROSS THE CHILCOOT PASSThe snow was falling in thick, blinding sheets when we reached LakeLinderman, and struggled up the first precipitous climb leading to thedreaded Chilcoot.A death-like stillness lingered in the valley; the towering mountainpeaks enclosing the chain of lakes had formed ample protection from theelements; but soon we ascended into a different atmosphere, where thewind burst upon us with dire force, and dashed the snow in cloudsagainst our faces. In vain we laboured on; my comrades sank at times totheir necks in the snow, even the sleigh was half buried in the seethingmasses, and rolled over continuously. I alone had snow-shoes, and forthe first time in the seven hundred miles' trail we had traversed Istrapped the long Indian "runners" to my moccasins, and endeavoured topad a track for the following train, but the attempt proved futile. Twohours after leaving the lake we had barely progressed a mile, and theair was becoming dark and heavy with the increasing fury of the gale,which tossed the white clouds aloft, and showered them over oursorely-tried caravan. Never had we dreamed of encountering such weather.We had come from the silent Klondike valley, where the tempests werehushed by the Frost King, who reigned with iron hand.At two in the afternoon we reached timber limit, and here a few stuntedtrees showed their tips above the snow, but beyond the bleak surfacesof Deep and Long Lakes appeared bare and forbidding, and the loud shriekof the gathering gale warned us to venture no further that day. Wehurriedly scooped a hole in the snow, and lined it with our furs; thenthe sleigh was mounted as a bulwark against the drifts, and we lay downin our strange excavation, exhausted and utterly disheartened. Mac atlength broke the silence. "We might have a fire o' some sort," he said,looking round. Very gingerly he and his companion crawled towards thetree-tops, and broke off the tough green branches. After much coaxingthe unwilling wood ignited, and we clustered joyfully round the pungentsmoke--for there was little else--and endeavoured to infuse some warmthinto our frozen bodies. The thick blackness of night was rapidly closingover, and the storm showed no signs of diminishing; so we obtained whattimber we could from the tree-tops, and stored it in our shelter to feedthe feeble fire through the long dreary night. Then we thawed some snow,and boiled a "billy" of coffee, and the warm fluid helped to sustain usgreatly; but still the wind howled and the snow pattered down on ourfaces with relentless force, and the drifts from the edge of our pitever and anon deluged us. How we passed that night is beyonddescription. We huddled near to each other for warmth, while our dogbeside us groaned and shivered violently despite all our efforts toprotect him from the icy blasts.Morning at last arrived, but no welcome light appeared; the aircontinued murky and dense with flying snow. Ten o'clock, eleven, andtwelve passed, and we were beginning to despair of getting a start thatday. Then the gloom merged into a dull grey haze, and we coulddistinguish faintly through the driving mists the glacier peaks flankingLong Lake. We had thawed snow and made coffee for breakfast, butnotwithstanding that fortification we felt ill-prepared to renew ourbattle with the elements."We'll make another try, boys," I said, after a brief survey around. "Wemay reach the summit to-day, but the chances are against it."Dave was again harnessed to the sleigh, and with three separate ropesattached we straggled forward on different tracks, and pulled as if fordear life. Slowly we forged ahead over Deep Lake, staggering, stumbling,and floundering wildly. Even Dave sank in the yielding track, and hisefforts to extricate himself would have been amusing--under differentcircumstances. As we proceeded the gale increased, and almost hurled usback, and I noted with alarm the heavy gathering clouds that seemed tohang between us and the pass; they spread rapidly, and with them camefresh blasts that whistled across the white lake surface, and tore itinto heaving swells even as we looked. I prayed for light, but the gloomdeepened and the snow fell thicker and faster. At length we reached thecañon leading to Crater Lake, and with every nerve strained we foughtour way forward literally foot by foot. The snow-wreaths here were ofextraordinary depths, and several times my companions would disappearaltogether, actually _swimming_ again to the surface, for only such amotion would sustain the body on the broken snow.At three o'clock we had travelled but two and a half miles, and thestorm was yet rising. Had we been provided with food our position wouldnot have caused us much alarm, but coffee had been our lot forforty-eight hours, and now raw coffee alone must be our portion, for wewere above timber limit, and so could have no fire. Starvation from coldand hunger combined promised to be rather a miserable finish to ourlabours. The deep breathing of my companions betrayed their sufferings;their weakened frames could ill endure such buffetings. At every otherstep they would sink in the vapoury snow, while poor Dave's muffledhowls were pitiful to hear."We'll have to camp again, boys," I shouted. But where could we camp,and preserve our already freezing bodies? As I have said, we were beyondtimber limit; only the dull, drifting snow appeared on every side, andthe darkness was quickly hiding even that from view. I relinquished mysleigh rope, and battled forward against the blizzard alone. Mysnow-shoes skimmed rapidly over the treacherous drifts, but the extremeexertion was too much for me, and I had to come to a halt. The air insuch a latitude, and at a 3,500-feet altitude, is keen enough even whenthere is no blizzard raging. In the few hundred yards I had sped ahead Ihad left my comrades hopelessly behind; they were blotted from my sightas if by an impenetrable pall. Suddenly, through a cleft in the drivingsleet, I caught a glimpse of a blue glistening mass close before me. Iremembered that I was in the vicinity of the large glacier at "HappyCamp," but the glacier had evidently "calved," for it was formerly wellup the mountain side. I staggered over to it, and felt its glassy sideswith interest; then I noticed a great cavity between the giant mass andthe mountain-ledge. It was indeed a calved glacier, and in its fall ithad formed a truly acceptable place of shelter. I cried loudly to mycompanions, but only the shriek of the blizzard was my reply. I wasafraid to leave my "find" in case I might not discover it again, so Idrew my Colt Navy and fired rapidly into the air. The sound seemed dulland insignificant in the howling storm, but a feeble bark near at handanswered back, and through the mists loomed my doughty henchmen withtheir sleigh-ropes over their shoulders, and crawling on all foursbeside the dog. They had been forced to divide their weight over thesnow in this strange fashion, and even as it was they sank at intervalswith many a gasp and splutter into the great white depths. "Happy Camp!"I cried."This is an end o' us a' noo," Mac wearily groaned, staggering into theice cavern."Happy Camp" was the name derisively applied to the vicinity in thesummer. It was then the first halting stage after crossing the pass, andas no timber existed near, no fires could be made, and hence the name.But what it was like at this time, in midwinter, is beyond my powers todescribe. Imagine a vast glittering field of ice stretching from thepeaks above to the frozen stream below, and a small idea of its miseriesas a camping-ground is at once apparent. Yet it was a welcome shelter tous at such a time, and we dragged the sleigh into the dark aperturethankfully, and, wrapping ourselves in our blankets, listened to themoaning of the storm outside. At each great rush of wind the walls ofour cave would quiver and crackle, and far overhead a deep rumblingbroke at intervals upon our ears. Our glacier home was certainly no saferetreat, for it was gradually, yet surely, moving downwards. Mycompanions recognised their perilous position immediately they heard thewell-known grinding sound, but they said nothing--they were evidently ofopinion that we were as safe inside as out, and, as Stewart afterwardsgrimly said, "It would hae been an easier death onywey."The cold was very intense, and we shivered in the darkness for hourswithout a word being spoken. To such an extremity had we been reducedthat Mac and Stewart assiduously chewed the greasy strips of caribouhide which did duty as moccasin laces, while I endeavoured, but withlittle success, to swallow some dry coffee. If we could only have afire, I reasoned, we might live to see the morning, but without itthere seemed little hope.We had all grown apathetic, and indeed were quite resigned to a horriblefate. I was aroused from a lethargic reverie by the piteous cries ofDave, who remained still harnessed. I patted his great shaggy head, andpulling my sheath-knife, cut the traces that bound him. As I did so myhand came in contact with the sleigh, and at once a new idea flashedover me."Get up, boys!" I cried. "We've forgotten that the sleigh will burn."In an instant they were on their feet. One thought was common to usall--we must have a fire, no matter the cost. Mac lighted a piece ofcandle, and stuck it on the hard ground. Then he and Stewart attackedthe sleigh energetically, and in a few moments the snow-ship that hadborne our all for seven hundred miles was reduced to splinters. Eagerlywe clustered round as the match was applied, and fanned the laggardflame with our breaths until it burst out cheerily, crackling andglowing, illuminating the trembling walls of the cavern, and causing thecrystal roof to scintillate with a hundred varying hues. Sparingly Macfed the flame; if we could only keep it alive till morning the blizzardmight have abated. Piece by piece the wood was applied, and the feeblefire was maintained with anxious care. Hour after hour passed, and stillthe blizzard howled, and the swirling snow-drifts swept to our feet aswe bent over our one frail comfort, and protected the wavering flamefrom the smothering sleet.At various times throughout the weary hours I fancied I could hear afaint moaning without our shelter, but the inky blackness of the nightobscured all vision, and after aimlessly groping in the snow for someminutes after each alarm, I had to crawl back benumbed and helpless."It must have been the wind," said Stewart."There's nae man could cross the pass last night," spoke Mac.Dave lay coiled up on my blanket apparently fast asleep. The nobleanimal had had nothing to eat for two days, and I feared he would notwake again. Suddenly, however, he started up, growling hoarsely. Themoaning sound again reached our ears, prolonged and plaintive. Then camethe sharp whistle of the blizzard, clear, decisive. There could be nomistake. Assuredly some unfortunate was out in the cruel storm. Ourfour-footed companion struggled to his feet with an effort, and swayingerratically, he rushed from the cave whining dolefully. We gazed at eachother in silence; we dreaded the discovery we were about to make."Keep the fire alight as a guide to us, Mac," I said, and Stewart and Iwent out into the storm. And now Dave's deep-mouthed barks penetratedthe dense mists, and we crawled towards the cañon in the direction ofthe sound; but we had not far to go. A few yards from our retreat I feltDave's furry body at my knees, and then my hand came in contact with ahuman form half buried in the drifts."It's a man, Stewart," I said, and he answered with a groan of sympathy.We extricated the stiff, frozen body from the engulfing snow and draggedit tenderly towards the light we had left; and there, in that miserablespot, we strove to bring back the life that had all but fled."We have nothing to gie him," said Mac hopelessly; "an' the fire's goneoot.""There should be some coffee," I answered, "and the furs and my longboots will burn."Soon our treasured possessions smouldered and flamed; boots, moccasins,silver-tipped furs--all that we had that would simmer or burn wassacrificed, and a piece of ice from the wall was thawed and slowlyboiled. When the hot fluid was forced between his lips the rescued manopened his eyes and looked around. Soon he had recovered sufficiently tospeak a few words. He had ventured across the Chilcoot, despite allwarnings from the miners at Sheep Camp. He had wandered over Crater Lakeall day, not knowing where the valley lay owing to the dense mistsprevailing. "The blizzard has been blowing on the pass for two days,"said he; "your light attracted me last night, but I could not reach it."Such was the tale of the poor victim of the pass; he died beforemorning, despite our struggles to save him, and we felt that we couldnot survive him long.No light appeared at ten o'clock, nor was there any promise of theblinding storm abating. Our fire had gone out, and we sat in darknessbeside the lifeless body we had saved from the snows."We'll make another try, boys," I said. "We may as well go under trying,if it has to be."Our load was small enough now; the pity was we had not lightened itsooner. I strapped the small mail-bag to my shoulders; my comradescarried all further impedimenta, and, leaving the dead man in his icyvault we staggered into the darkness and forced an erratic track towardsthe Chilcoot Pass. Crater Lake was reached in two hours; I could onlyguess we had arrived at it by the evenness of the surface, the air wasso dense that objects could not be distinguished even a few feetdistant. I tried to fix a bearing by compass, but the attempt wasfutile, the needle swaying to all points in turn, owing to the magneticinfluences around. Then we _felt_ for the mountain-side on the left, andstaggered over the blast-blown rocks and glaciers along its precipitoussteeps.As we neared the summit the howl of the blizzard increased to a shrill,piercing whistle, but we now were sheltered by the pass, and the fierceblast passed overhead. All this time we forced onward through a murkygloom with our bodies joined with ropes that we might not lose oneanother. At three in the afternoon I calculated that we were near thecrucial point at which the final ascent can be negotiated, and we leftthe white shores of Crater Lake and clambered up into the rushing mistswhere the blizzard shrieked and moaned alternately, and hurled hugeblocks of glacier ice and frozen snow down into the Crater valley. Thetop was reached at last, and no words of mine can describe the infernothat raged on that dread summit. We lay flat on our faces and writhedour way forward through a bubbling, foaming mass of snow and ice. Ourbodies were cut and bruised with the flying _débris_, and our clothingwas torn to rags. The blizzard had now attained an extraordinary pitch,the mountain seemed to rock and tremble with its fury, and inch by inchwe crawled towards the perpendicular declivity leading to the"Scales"--full eight hundred feet of almost sheer descent. Cautiously wemanoeuvred across the great glacier that rests in the Devil'sCauldron--a cup-shaped hollow in the top of the notorious pass--and atonce the blaze of a fire burst before our eyes, illuminating theapparently bottomless depths beyond.The ice-field on which we lay overhung the rocks to a dangerous degree,and I realised that we must make the descent from some other part of thesemicircular ridge. We crept back hurriedly, and as we stood gasping inthe "cauldron" before making a _détour_ to find a possible trail, amighty rumbling shook the pass, and we clutched at the snow around,which flew upwards in great geyser-like columns, almost smothering us inits descending showers. The overlapping ice had plunged into the valley,carrying with it hundreds of tons of accumulated snow; we escaped thepowerful suction by a few yards only.[Illustration: ON THE SAFE SIDE OF THE PASS AGAIN.               MAC--SELF--STEWART.]When we approached the edge a second time a smooth, unbroken snowsteepmarked the trail of the glacier, and to it we consigned ourselves,literally sliding down into the black depths. We were precipitated intoan immense wreath of snow covering the scales for over a hundred feet.The fire had been blotted out with the icy deluge, but luckily, as welearned later, the fire-feeders had abandoned their post long before theavalanche had come down. Three hours later we arrived at Sheep Camp, andentered the Mascotte saloon, where the assembled miners were clusteredround a huge stove in the centre of the room, listening to the ominousshriek of the gale outside.No one dared venture out that night, but in the morning the four days'blizzard had spent itself, and we formed a party to explore the damagedone. A light railway that had been laid to the Scales was completelydemolished, and half down to Sheep Camp the channel of the ChilcootRiver was filled with enormous ice boulders. An avalanche had alsofallen on Crater Lake during the night, and when we had painfullyclimbed the now bare summit the frozen plateau beyond was rent fornearly a mile with enormous gashes over ten feet in width, and the icecleavage showed down as far as the eye could reach.PART IIUNDER THE SOUTHERN CROSSTHE FIVE-MILE RUSHIt was a very hot day in September when we arrived at Perth, WesternAustralia, and hastened to put up at the nearest hotel to the station,which happened to bear the common enough title of the "Royal."We had come up with the mail train from Albany, where the P. & O.steamers then called, and even Westralia's most ardent admirers wouldhesitate to claim comfort as one of the features of the Colony's railwaysystem. So we arrived, after a long night's misery, dusty andtravel-stained. No one attempts to keep clean in the land of "Sand, sin,and sorrow," for the simple reason that, according to the nature ofthings there, such a luxurious state of æsthetic comfort can never beattained. The streets were sandy, and as a natural sequence theatmosphere was not of ethereal quality. The people were sandy andparched-looking, and we found the interior of the hotel little betterthan the outside, so far as the presence of the powdery yellow grainswas concerned.In the darkened bedrooms the hum of the festive mosquito was heard, andmy companions chuckled at the sound."It's a lang time since I heard they deevils," said Mac; then heproceeded, "Noo, oot on the Pampas----""D--n the Pampas!" roared Stewart, as he clutched wildly at one of thepests that had been quietly resting on his cheek for full half aminute."Ye've pushioned that onfort'nate beast," Mac retorted, with unruffledserenity; "noo, can ye no let the puir thing dee in peace?"We remained but a short time in Perth; it is a neatly-laid-out littlecity with streets running off at right angles to each other, andcontaining a fair sprinkling of fine buildings, among which may bementioned the General Post Office and Lands Offices, and they arepalatial edifices indeed. The Botanical Gardens are small, yet verypretty; and here, instead of the usual garden loafer, may be found manyweary-eyed and parchment-skinned gold-diggers from the "fields," whoseone idea of a holiday lies in a visit to Perth or Fremantle, where theystroll about or recline on the artificially-forced grass plots of thesetowns, and wile the weary hours away.The Swan River at Perth forms an exquisite piece of scenery, whichredeems the environs of the sandy city from utter ugliness. Innumerableblack swans swim hither and thither on its placid waters, and by thesloping banks, well fringed with rushes, many notable yachting clubshave their pavilions. There is nothing in this Capital of the WesternColony to attract. Even to the casual observer it is plain that thebustling, Oriental-looking town is essentially a gateway to thegoldfields, and little more. Fremantle, on the other hand, is the Port,and chief engineering and commercial centre.At this period I was, like most erratic travellers, without a definiteobject in view. In a certain hazy way I thought that we should visit themining districts at once, as we had done in other and more impracticablecountries; yet I was aware that the known Westralian goldfields were byno means so new as the "finds" in North-West Canada, and in consequencethe ground might be over-pegged or long since rushed."The countrie is big enuff," said Mac when I mentioned my doubts, "an'we'll mebbe find anither Gold Bottom Creek faurer oot than onybody hasgaed.""We're better diggin' holes, even if they are duffers," spoke Stewart,"than makin' oorsel's meeserable at hame." Which argument in a sensesettled the matter, and I forthwith purchased tickets for Kalgoorlie,with the intention of penetrating thence towards the far interior.It is a weary journey eastward from Perth, and one that cannot be tooquickly passed over. The single narrow-gauge line has been laid withoutany attempt at previous levelling, and the snorting little engine puffsover switchback undulations ceaselessly, at a speed that averages nearlysixteen miles an hour. It is a fortunate circumstance for the freshenthusiast from "home" that the "Kalgoorlie Mail" leaves Perth in theevening. The discomfort experienced in the midnight ride is bad enough,but he is mercifully spared from viewing the "scenery" along the route,which would assuredly have a most demoralising effect: Western Australiamust be taken gradually.The Coolgardie "rush" may be fresh in the minds of most people. Thetownship now stands almost deserted, bearing little trace of formerglory; and yet it is but a few years since the railway was pushed out tothis remote settlement. Southern Cross, two hundred miles nearer thecoast, was formerly the terminus of all traffic, and the hardy pioneersof Coolgardie daringly ventured on foot from this point, as did also thevast numbers who "followed the finds."Very insidiously Kalgoorlie has risen to high eminence as a miningcentre; it accomplished the eclipse of its sister camp some time ago,and by reason of its deep lodes it is likely to retain its supremacyindefinitely. To the individual miners a new strike or location isconsidered to be "played out" when limited liability companies begin toappear in their midst, as only in rare cases can fossickers succeed incompetition with machinery. However, the flat sand formations aroundKalgoorlie have proved one of the exceptions to this rule, and thealluvial digger may still sink his shallow shaft here with every hope ofsuccess, and even in the proved "deep" country surface indications areabundant.When my little party stepped from the train at Kalgoorlie, we saw beforeus a scattered array of wooden and galvanised-iron houses,white-painted, and glistening dully in the sunlight through an extremelymurky atmosphere. On closer acquaintance the heterogeneous erectionsresolved themselves into a wide principal thoroughfare, aptly namedHannan's Street, after the honoured prospector of the Camp's main reef,and a number of side paths that bore titles so imposing that my memoryat once reverted to the fanciful names distinguishing the crude logshanties of Dawson, where there were: Yukon Avenue, Arctic Mansions,Arcadian Drive, and Eldorado Terrace. Here, in keeping with the latitudeof the city, more salubrious, if equally fantastic, were the variousdesignations of the alleys and byways.In the near distance we could see the towering tappet heads of thewidely-known Great Boulder mine, and the din created by the revolvinghammers of the ever-active stamping machinery assailed our ears as anindescribable uproar. But beyond the dust and smoke of theseNature-combating engines of civilisation, the open desert, dotted withits stunted mulga and mallee growths, shimmered back into the horizon.Here and there a dump or mullock heap showed where the alluvial minerhad staked his claim, but for the most part the landscape was unbrokenby any sign of habitation."There's a lot of room in this country, boys," I said, as we stoodunobserved in the middle of the street and took in the scene."It's a deevil o' a funny place," Mac ventured doubtfully."It's a rale bonnie place," reproved Stewart, whom the inexpressiblegloom peculiar to the interior country had not yet affected. "I'mthinkin'," he continued, with asperity, "that ane or twa men o' pairtslike oorsel's were jist needed at this corner o' the warld.""In ony case," Mac now agreed, "it's better than being meeserable athame."Instead of seeking the hospitality of one of the numerous hotels closeby, we decided to begin our campaign in earnest right away, and getunder canvas as a proper commencement. So we prospected around for agood camping site, and that same night we slept in our tent, erectedabout a mile distant from the township.There was no water in our vicinity, and next morning Stewart set outwith two newly-purchased water-bags to obtain three gallons of the veryprecious fluid at a condensing establishment we had noticed on theprevious night, where, at sixpence a gallon, a tepid brackish liquid wassparingly dispensed. It should be understood that water, in most partsof Western Australia, is more difficult to locate than gold, and whenobtained it is usually as a dense solution, salt as the sea, andimpregnated with multitudinous foreign elements extremely difficult toprecipitate."There's aye something tae contend wi' in furrin countries," Macphilosophised, as he leisurely proceeded to build a fire for cookingoperations. "In Alaska there wis snaw, an' Chilkoots, an' mony ithertrifles; bit here there's naething much objeckshunable let alane thesand an' want o' watter."I agreed with him if only for the sake of avoiding an argument. "Theremay be a few--insects along with the sand, Mac," I hazarded cheerfully,and then I went into the tent to arrange the breakfast utensils."Insecks!" cried he derisively after me. "Wha cares fur insecks, I shidlike tae ken? What herm is there in a wheen innocent muskitties, furinstance? Insecks! Humph!"The absurdity of my remark seemed to tickle him vastly, and as he brokethe eucalyptus twigs preparatory to setting a match to the pile he hadcollected, he continued to chuckle audibly. Then suddenly there wassilence, a silence so strange that I felt impelled to look out of thetent and see what had happened; but before I had time to set down thetinware cups I held in my hands, his voice broke out afresh. "Insecks!"I heard him mutter. "Noo A wunner----; bit no, that canna be, fur snakeshiv'na got feet, an' this deevil's weel supplied i' that direction. It'sa bonnie beast, too. I wunner if it bites?" I gathered from theseremarks that the valiant Mac had made the acquaintance of some unknownspecies of "insect" with which he was unduly interested. "If it's aninseck," came the voice again, "this countrie maun be anex-tra-ord'nar'----Haud aff! ye deevil. Haud off! I tell ye." Ihastened outside just in time to see my companion ruthlessly slaughter alarge-sized centipede, which had evidently refused to be propitiated byhis advances."It's a vera re-markable thing," said he, looking up with a perfectlygrave countenance, "hoo they--insecks--persist in bringin' destruckshunon themsel's. I wis just pokin' this onfort'nate beast wi' a stick--in afreen'ly wey, ye ken--an' the deevil made a rin at me, wi' malishusintent, I'm thinkin', an' noo he's peyed the penalty o' his misguidedackshun."[Illustration: STEWART PREPARING OUR FIRST MEAL.]"In future, Mac," I warned, "you'd better not attempt to get on friendlyterms with these--insects; a bite from a centipede might kill you.""I'll gie ye best about the insecks," he returned thoughtfully, applyinga match to the pile, "bit ye'll admit," he added, after some moments'pause, "that it's maist ex-tra-ord'nar' tae see insecks o' sichonnaitural descripshun rinnin' aboot on the face o' the earth."I fully concurred, much to his satisfaction, and just then Stewartarrived, perspiring under his watery load."Dae ye mean tae tell me," howled the new-comer, addressing no one inparticular, "that ye hiv'na got the fire ken'l'd yet?""Ca' canny, Stewart, ca' canny," sternly admonished the guilty one."There's been a narrow escape here, ma man, a verra narrow escape."Stewart's ruddy face blanched slightly, then slowly regained its colourwhen the slain centipede was pointed out. "Ye've raelly had aprovidenshul escape, Mac," said he. "Noo, staun aside an' let me get onwi' the cookin'."Our first breakfast in camp was an unqualified success; it was not avery elegant repast, certainly, but the traveller must learn to foregoall luxuries and enjoy rough fare, and we had already served ourapprenticeship in that direction. Stewart, however, had lost none of hisart in matters culinary, and, as he himself averred, could cook"onything frae a muskittie tae an Injun," so we had every reason to becontented."If we wur only camped aside a second Gold Bottom!" sighed Mac, gettinghis pipe into working order."It's a bonnie countrie," mused his companion, "wi' a bonnie blue skyabune, an' what mair could a man want?""I think we have had no cause to complain, so far, boys," was myaddition to the conversation, "and I'll go into the township in an houror so and make investigations as to the latest strikes. To-morrow we maymake a definite camp."And so the early day passed while we rested and smoked, and recalled ourgrim experiences in the land of snows."It's mebbe wrang tae mak' compairisons," grunted Mac, "bit gie me thesunshine an' the floo'ers----""An' the centipedes!" Stewart slyly interpolated."D--n centipedes!" roared Mac; then he recovered himself. "Mak' nae mairallushuns, ma man," said he with dignity. "An' hoo daur ye spile mapoetic inspirashun?"The sun was now well overhead and shooting down intense burning rays;the sky was cloudless, and not a breath stirred the branches of thedwarfed eucalyptii on the plains."It's a g-glorious day," murmured Stewart, mopping his perspiringforehead.Mac chuckled: "Wait till ye see some o' the insecks the sun'll bringout," said he, "ye'll be fairly bamfoozled."At this moment I was surprised to notice a man, armed with pick andshovel, approaching rapidly in our direction. As he came near I saw thathe bore, strapped to his shoulders, a bundle of wooden pegs which hadevidently been hastily cut from the outlying timber. "Some energeticindividual thinks we have made a find at this camp," I thought; but Iwas mistaken. The stranger made as if to pass a good way off our tent;then he hesitated, looked back, apprehensively, it seemed to me, andcame quickly towards us."What in thunder does yer mean by campin' here, mates?" he demandedhurriedly, grounding his shovel impatiently and letting his eyes roam inan unseeing manner over the surrounding country.I had barely time to explain that ours was only a temporary camp, when,without a word, he shouldered his shovel and sped onwards into thebrush."Maist onmainnerly behaviour," Mac snorted wrathfully. "Noo, if I meetthat man again, I'll----" He stopped suddenly. "Ho, ho!" he chuckled,"there's mair o' them comin'; I begin tae smell a rat." We now observedwhat had caused the sudden flight of our visitor. Rushing from everyshanty near the township, and issuing from the main street in a chaoticmass, a perfect sea of men bearing axes and picks and shovels camesurging down on us. As we looked the fleeter members of the "rush"forged quickly ahead, so that the spectacle soon appeared as a medleyarmy advancing desperately at the double in Indian file.There was no need to be in ignorance as to what it meant; we had seenthe same thing often enough in Alaska when strikes on the Upper Klondikewere frequent."Get the tent down, boys," I said, "and follow on when you're ready.I'll represent this camp and see that it is not last on the programme."Even before I had finished speaking, my companions were tugging wildlyat the guy ropes, and loosening the wall pegs of the tent."We'll no be faur ahint," growled Mac from beneath the canvas foldswhich in his zeal he had brought down upon himself."Ye shid let me gang first," grumbled Stewart, "fur ye ken weel that Ican sprint wi' ony man."I seized an axe and shovel and awaited the approach of the van-leader ofthe struggling line of humanity, who was fast drawing near: not knowingthe destination of the rush, it was necessary that I should follow someone who did. I had not long to wait. A lean, lanky true son of the bush,with nether garments held in position by an old cartridge belt, burstthrough the brushwood a few yards wide of us. His leathery face showednot the slightest trace of emotion, and though the heat was swelteringnot a drop of perspiration beaded on his forehead. Heaven knows howoften he may have taken part in a rush and been disappointed."Mornin', boys," he said genially. "Fust-class exercise, this," and hepassed at a regular swinging pace, with eyes fixed straight ahead,steering a direct course."He gangs like clockwork," said Mac admiringly, gazing after him; "bithaud on. What's this comin'?"The second runner was now coming forward at a rate that was rapidlyannihilating distance; he had passed the bulk of the others since he hadjoined the race, and I had been much interested in watching hisprogress."Guid Lor'," ejaculated Stewart, stopping in his work of rolling up thetent, and gazing at the approaching runner in dismay. "Did ye ever seeonything like that in a' yer born days?"There was ample excuse for his astonishment. The fleeing figure washatless, and otherwise ludicrously garbed--for Westralia. What Stewartcalled a "lang-tailie coat" spread out behind him like streamers in abreeze, a "biled" collar had, in the same gentleman's terse language,"burst its moorings" and projected in two miniature wings at the back ofhis ears, and a shirt that had once been white, bosomed out expansivelythrough an open vest. Yet, notwithstanding his cumbrous habiliments, hehad well outdistanced his nearest "hanger-on," and it was plain that thewiry sandgroper still in front would have to screw on more speed if hemeant to keep his lead long.With lengthy strides the strangely-garbed runner shot past; in his handhe gripped a spade, which tended to make his appearance the morewonderful, but that he meant business was very evident."Fur Heaven's sake, pit aff the coat!" howled Stewart, and Mac toneddown the impertinence of the remark by adding stentoriously--"Ye'll rin lichter withoot it, ma man."The individual addressed slowed up at once. "Thanks for the idea, boys,"said he good-naturedly, and he promptly discarded the objectionableemblem of civilised parts and threw it carelessly into a mulga bush.Then noting that he was a good way in advance of the main army, hemopped his streaming face and gave the information, "There's been a bigstrike at the Five Mile, boys, wherever that may be. I am letting thefirst man steer the way on purpose.""Ye're a daisy tae rin," admiringly spoke Mac, seizing the tent and apacket of miscellaneous merchandise, while Stewart feverishly gatheredup the remainder of our meagre belongings. He of the "biled shirt" nowset down to work again, making a pace which I, who had joined in thechase, found hard indeed to emulate; and my companions, heavily laden asthey were, hung into our rear like leeches.Far behind we could hear the sand crunch under hundreds of feet, and themallee shrubs crackling and breaking, but hardly a word was spoken. Mileafter mile we crashed through the endless brush and over the monotonousiron-shot plains. Mac puffed and blowed like some huge grampus, andStewart's deep breathing sounded like the exhaust expirations of anoverworked steam engine."Keep her gaun, Mac; keep her gaun," this personage would splutter whenhis more portly comrade showed signs of flagging, which well he might,considering that he clutched in his arms a weight of nearly fortypounds."Wha's stoppin'? ye inseegneeficant broken-winded donkey engine!"retorted his aggravated compatriot, rolling along manfully.But the race was nearly over. Half a mile further on the land dippedever so slightly, and in the gentle hollow formed about a dozen menrushed madly about, pacing off prospectors' claims, and driving rudepegs at the boundary corners.The sight had an exhilarating effect on Mac and Stewart, and with wildshouts they quickly drew up the little distance they had lost, and wouldhave passed my white-shirted pacemaker and myself were we not compelledfor very shame to keep our lead if we died for it."By Jove!" panted he of the strange garments, "these beggars behind canrun."And Mac at his heels chivalrously grunted between his breaths, "I'venever had a harder tussle tae keep up ma deegnity--no never."A few minutes more, and we reached the field of operations. The menthere were too busy marking off their properties to give us muchattention. I noticed swiftly that our first visitor of the few words hadhis claim neatly pegged, and was sitting in the middle of it,complacently smoking. He must have received special information of thefind or he could not have got away so much before the others. Our secondpassing acquaintance--he of the emotionless countenance who had steeredour quartet unknowingly--had got in a hundred yards ahead of us, and hewas now coolly cutting pegs with which to mark his chosen area."It's a deep alluvial leader, mate," he said to me. Then he addedobligingly, "I guess I knows the lie of the kintry, an' if ye hitch onat the end o' my boundaries, ye'll likely sink on it, plumb."The advice of an experienced miner should always be accepted; and whileMac and Stewart were felling several small trees for use asmarking-posts, I proceeded to line off the direction of our claim assuggested by the angle of my adviser's corner channels. I performed thiswork with much care, knowing how slim are one's chances of holding anygold-bearing area at a rush unless the holder's title is beyond disputeaccording to official regulations.The straggling body of men was now beginning to appear on the crest ofthe undulation which marked the only visible natural boundary of thevalley; in less than three minutes the madly-striving crowd would beupon us, and we should be assuredly swamped by its numbers so that nopegs could be driven. Then I noticed the man who had doffed hisfashionable coat to oblige Stewart, standing dejectedly near by; hissleeves were rolled up, displaying splendidly-formed muscles, and heheld his shovel loosely in his hand as if uncertain what to do with it."Better get your pegs fixed quickly," I advised.But he shook his head rather sadly. "I haven't got an axe," he said,"and--and I'm new to this sort of thing."Mac had by this time obtained the four blazed posts necessary to denoteour "three-men square," and Stewart promptly began to smite them intoposition in their proper places."If ye'll alloo me," said Mac, "I'll get the bitties o' sticks fur ye;I'd be vera sorry tae a bonnie rinner like you left in the cauld."But there was no time now."Shift out our posts instead, Mac," I instructed, "we'll make a four-menlot of it and divide afterwards."Our white-shirted associate looked at me gratefully, and held out hishand. "My name is Philip Morris," he said. "I am an Englishman, just outfrom the old country."A swaying mob of perspiring and fiery-eyed men of all nationalities nowflooded the valley as a tumultuous sea of humanity, and scattered intwos and fours throughout its entire length."You've struck a circus for a start, Morris," I said. "I think we'll allremember the Five-Mile Rush."SINKING FOR GOLDNext morning the Five-Mile Flat was the scene of extraordinary activity.Tents sprung up like mushrooms in all directions, and the thud, thud ofpicks sounded incessantly. It was almost pitiful to witness the feverisheagerness with which most of the diggers tried to bottom on theirclaims. The depth of the Lead at Discovery shaft was given out to beonly forty feet, but the strata encountered before that level wasreached had been of a flinty impervious nature, necessitating the use ofmuch giant powder.At least the original prospectors, who were camped near to us, gave methat information in a fit of generosity when they learned that I hadsome little experience of geological formations. They even allowed me todescend their shaft--most unheard-of thing--and compute the angle anddip of the lode for the benefit of the general assembly; a privilegewhich was duly appreciated, as it enabled me to calculate the properposition in our own claim at which to sink. The lode, so called, provedto be an auriferous wash, or alluvial gutter, the bed of an extremelyancient watercourse, probably silted up long before the time of thePharaohs.Our newly-acquired companion, who had already won the good graces ofboth Mac and Stewart, astonished me greatly, while I was expounding mytheories on these matters for his special edification, by makingseveral courteous corrections to my statements, so that I was forced totread more cautiously; and when I had finished, he capped my argumentwith a lucid technical discourse and much scientific addenda."You certainly know a fair-sized amount for an inexperienced man," Isaid, with some irritation; but he hastened to explain."My knowledge is purely theoretical," he replied. "Perhaps I should nothave spoken."His admirable good sense appealed to Mac's idea of fairness. "I'mthinkin'," began that gentleman, gazing at me reproachfully, "I'mthinkin' that oor freen Phil-ip is a vera modest man, a vera modest manindeed.""I'm o' the opeenion," cried Stewart, from the interior of the tent,"that if he keeps awa' frae tailie coats, and dresses rashunal, he'll bea rale orniment tae ony camp."The young man was much moved by these expressions of good-will; but whenI asked him to mark off his allotment on our too large mining territory,he stubbornly refused. "If it had not been for your kindness I shouldhave no claim to any corner of the ground," he said.I explained, however, that Mac, Stewart, and myself would not be allowedby law to possess a four-men holding, and therefore there was nokindness on my part in giving him back his own. Yet still he hesitated."I am all alone, boys," he said at last, "and I don't think I could domuch damage to the ground by myself. Might I come in with you?"This was a _dénoûement_ I had not anticipated, though in someunaccountable manner I felt drawn to the stranger; still, the vision ofhis coat-tails fluttering in the wind could not be dispelled."What do you say, Mac?" I asked, expecting a gruff rejoinder in thenegative; but the answer agreeably surprised me.[Illustration: "DISCOVERY" SHAFT--ON GOLD.]"He's a man o' pairts like oorsel's, a modest man, an' a golologistforbye," replied Mac, grandiloquently; "it wud be sinfu' tae refuse himoor guid company."Then Stewart, who had been paying great attention, rushed from the tentand added his testimony. "Tailie coat or no tailie coat," he shouted,"he's a guid man, as I kin testeefy, an' me an' Mac'll be prood tae haehim wi' us. Forbye," he continued, "he's a Breetisher, an' tho' he isnaScotch, me an' Mac'll look ower that fau't wi' muckle tolerashun.""I wis aboot tae re-mark----" began Mac, but Stewart had not completedhis peroration."Haud yer tongue, Mac," said he sternly; "ye ken weel yer nae speakerlike me." Then he resumed the flow of his eloquence: "An' noo," he said,"on behauf o' Mac--wha is a man o' disteenction tho' he disna lookit--an' in conformeety wi' ma ain incleenations, I hae pleesure insignifyin' oor muckle approval o' yer qualities."The candidate for admission to our illustrious company looked gratified,as well he might, and straightening his tall form he endeavoured to makesuitable reply to the expectant couple."Gentlemen!" said he, and at the word Mac hitched up his nether garmentsand looked solemn, while Stewart coughed discreetly. "Gentlemen,"repeated "tailie coat" in a voice that seemed to issue from his boots,"it is with considerable feeling of elation that I have heard yourextemporaneous----""Haud on!" howled Mac in horror; "ye'll dae, ma man, ye'll dae. Come on,Stewart." And as they walked sorrowfully apart Stewart's voice floatedback plaintively,"Noo, Mac, hoo am I gaun tae keep up oor digneety efterthat--ex-tem-por-anee----! He's deceived us, Mac; he's a lamb in sheep'sooter gairments, he is.""Well, Phil," I said, when they had disappeared within the tent, "Ithink we'll get along all right.""I feel at home already," he replied, looking towards the tent in grimamusement, "and enthusiastic enough to swing a pick with either Mac orStewart, and that means much, I think.""It does," I agreed with significance, and we went off to mark the siteof our prospective shaft.It was nearly midday before we commenced to excavate the ground, and bythat time most of the miners around had penetrated several feet of thetop sandy formation in their various claims. But haste is not alwaysadvisable under such circumstances, and I preferred to make as sure aspossible of the lode's position within our pegs before sinking, and soobviate any necessity for laborious "driving" when bedrock was reached.We were fortunately in the "shallowest" ground, being within a hundredyards of the forty-feet level strike, which meant, judging by the dip orinclination of the auriferous wash, that we should probably find bottomabout fifty feet down. As for the numbers below us, they might have tosink over a hundred feet, and even then miss the golden leader, soelusive are these subterranean channels.The usual size of prospectors' shafts on any goldfield is five feet sixinches long, by two feet six inches wide, and this just permits ofsufficient room for one man to wield a pick. The aim of every miner onan unproved field is to get down to bedrock with the least possiblelabour, which is also the speediest method. A shaft can be widenedafterwards when it has been found worth while, but it is always well torefrain from shovelling out two or three tons of granite-like substance,as is done by most "new chums," merely for the sake of having moreelbow-room during the trying process of sinking.After our experience with the frozen gravel at Klondike, it almostseemed like child's play to dig out the comparatively loose sandconglomeration which formed the topmost layer in the line of ourdescent. There was no fire-burning necessary here, but Nature,nevertheless, had made the balance even, for the auriferous levels inAlaska were rarely half as deep as even the shallow gutter we were nowsearching for. And again, in frozen ground the surface formations arenaturally the hardest, whereas in most other workings that order isreversed."It's a pleesure tae work i' this grund," was Mac's statement, when,after scarcely two hours' labour, he stood nearly waist deep in the newshaft. With much foresight, that wily individual had volunteered to sinkthe first few feet alone. "I'm just burstin' wi' surplush energy," heexplained to Stewart, "an' you can dae twa or three fit o' the easystuff when I'm feenished.""It's rale conseederate o' ye, Mac," said Stewart feelingly, withthoughts on the nature of things at Skookum Gulch, and he went insidethe tent to try if anything edible could be gathered together for lunch,a matter on which he said he had "graive doots."Our new comrade, whom we had already begun to address as "Phil," quicklyshowed himself to be a very worthy addition to our party. Afterexploring the scrub for timber suitable for banking-up purposes, anddrawing back a goodly load, he politely insisted on Mac taking a spellwhile he swung the pick. "I can see," he said diplomatically, "that youwould soon work yourself to death out of sheer consideration forothers.""Dae ye think sae?" grunted he in the shaft cautiously, pausing in hislabours."I do, indeed," reiterated Phil with much earnestness.Then Mac laid down his weapon, and leaning back lazily in his excavationmade further circuitous inquiry. "Ye've never dug holes afore, Phil?"said he; and receiving a negative answer, he supplemented, "An' ye kenthat ironstane is a wee bit--weel, I'll say solid?""Yes, I can understand that much," admitted Phil wonderingly."Weel," continued Mac, lowering his voice, "I've come on a bed o' it thenoo, an' I'm jist makin' the tap o't clean an' tidy fur Stewart when hecomes. He thinks he can equal me at onything, an' I've got tae checkthat fause impreshun. Dae ye savy?""Mac," said Phil with decision, "he'll be a smart man that gets thebetter of you.""I've traivelled a bit," returned the schemer shortly, "an' Stewart'ssometimes ill tae pit up wi'. I'll gie ye a bonnie saft bit taepracteese on efterwards," he added after a pause.A little later Stewart announced that he had got some rice and "tinneddog" cooked. "I houp ye'll excuse the rice," said he, "it's a bit podgy,fur there wis vera little watter tae bile it in.""Ye're looking rale worried-like, Stewart," said Mac sympathetically, ashe gulped down his portion of the roasted grains. "It's exerceese ye'reneedin', I'm thinkin'.""Mebbe it is," sighed Stewart dolorously."Weel," spoke Mac again, "ye can try an' wear doon the shaft a bit inthe efternoon, an' me an' Phil 'll gang into the city an' getsome tasty bits o' provisions. I'm vera concerned aboot ye, ma man."It was indeed very necessary that we should obtain supplies withoutdelay, for our stores consisted only of the remnants carried sohurriedly from our previous camp. Already, the first flush of excitementhaving died away, representatives from the different claims werehurrying towards the township on a similar mission. Enthusiasm and anempty stomach seldom agree. But here a difficulty arose. Phil's wardrobewas painfully small; his once spotless shirt was now yellow with sand,and almost torn into shreds, and the rest of his limited apparel was insuch a state of disrepair, owing to his scramble through the brush,that, as Mac said, he looked "hardly respeectable.""Ye can hae ma jecket," said Stewart magnanimously, "seein' that it wison ma account ye pit aff the tailie coat."Phil accepted the offer promptly. "There's a wonderful change in myappearance since I left the Old Country a few short weeks ago," said he,surveying his dilapidated garb ruefully."I shid think sae," grinned Mac. "It wud be a rale treat tae see ye walkdoon Peecadeely in they claes." And they departed."Dae ye tell me that Mac has gaun doon five fit?" asked Stewart, when wewere alone."I believe he has," I replied, "but in this country it is easy to dignear the surface where the sand has not even solidified.""Easy or no' easy," responded Stewart impressively, baring his strongright arm, "what Mac can dae, I'll dae. Wha pu'd harder than I did gauntae Klonduk?" he demanded, making a digression, but I waived thequestion."Let me know when you have had enough of the shaft," I said, "and I'llrelieve you.""Umph!" he grunted, ignoring my remark in turn, "Five feet! Whaur's thepick?" And he strode off to emulate his comrade's achievement.A few moments later a series of sharp metallic echoes issued from theshaft mouth, intimating that Stewart had attacked a hard unyieldingsubstance. Then, not wishing to be present when he desisted from hislabours, I made my way stealthily to the adjoining claim and enteredinto conversation with its owner; but still the unsympathetic ring ofsteel meeting some kindred element reached my ears, and I sorrowed forthe unfortunate Stewart right deeply.The wiry sandgroper whom I interviewed was not one of the bustling kind.I found him enjoying a siesta under the scant shade of the solitarymulga bush on his domain, and scaring the numberless flies away by hisvigorous snores. It was almost impossible to realise that he was thevaliant runner of the day before. "Mornin', mate," said he, rubbing hiseyes, after I had hustled him gently. It was late afternoon, but thatwas a small matter, and I did not trouble to correct him; and we talkedtogether on mining subjects for about an hour."I ain't wan o' them cusses," he said, "that tries to git disappintedearly. My tactics is: git thar in the fust place--at which you'll allowI is no slouch, nuther?" I made the necessary allowance, and heproceeded. "In the second place, thar ain't no call to be desp'rit'lyexcited; thishyer life won't change worse'n a muskitter whether we doesgit to bottom on a spec. three or four days sooner or later." I venturedto remark that his reasonings did him credit. "I does philosophise abit, mate," he agreed languidly. Then there followed a long silence,during which I missed the regular thuds of Stewart's pick, and wonderedwhere that persistent gentleman had gone.Suddenly a noise as of thunder startled me; it was succeeded by anexplosion that shook the ground under our feet. "By the Great Howlin'Billy!" ejaculated my leather-skinned companion, "somebody's fired yourshaft." I looked in time to see great boulders of jagged ironstone, anda dense volume of sand, hurled from the mouth of the narrow pit whereStewart had been working.Filled with a vague fear I rushed to the scene of the disturbance, wherethe sand-clouds were fast settling, and just as I arrived I beheldStewart calmly coming out towards me from behind Phil's timber pile,where he had been sheltered. My surprise was so great that for themoment speech failed me, and I looked vacantly at the shaft and at mycompanion in turn. Then he took pity on me, and condescended to explain."It's a' richt. I'm nae pheenix," he announced cheerfully, and he led meto the mouth of the shaft, which no longer retained its oblong contour,but was ragged and rent with the upheaval. "I wis lookin' fur ye abootan hour since," he continued further, "tae get yer opeenion concernin' asort o' irin furmashun what wis gi'en me sair trouble, bit as I could'nasee ye, I kent ye could rely on ma guid jidgement tae dae what I thochtbest----""But I was not aware that we had any gelignite or giant powder in ourpossession," I interrupted."Nae mair we had," said he, "bit I kept ane or twa extra speecialcartreedges what we used fur burstin' glashiers oot in Alaskie--assamples, ye ken--an' I pit them a' in. They've made a vera bonnie hole,"he wound up; "that's the best o' they labour-savin' devices."On examination it was found that the ironstone bar had been completelyshattered, and little trouble was experienced in removing the remainingfragments. The cavity wherein it had rested was fully five feet deep, sothat Mac's plot for outwitting his rival had proved a signal failure.It was six o'clock when we descried Mac and Phil returning fromKalgoorlie, laden with stores; darkness was rapidly closing over thevalley, so that their forms could not be distinguished until they werequite close. Then Stewart uttered a howl of rage. "They've brocht backthe tailie coat," he cried feebly, and in strutted Mac, wearing not onlythat hateful garment, but also having perched on his head at a rakishtilt a highly-burnished silk hat."We fund the hat a wee bit faurer on than the coatie," said he, doffinghis glossy headgear and gazing at it admiringly."If ye've ony regaird fur ma feelin's, ye'll pit them baith awa' ataince," Stewart implored, much affected.His compatriot gazed at him commiseratingly. "Ye've been workin' ow'erhard the day, ma man," said he, "yer nerves are in a gey bad state, I'mthinkin'. Hoosomever," he added sternly after brief thought, "it'songratefu' on your pairt tae despise the gairment, fur I promised Philthat ye shid hae it, purvided ye had sunk aboot three feet the day.Which," he climaxed, nonchalantly, "I hae nae doot ye hae dune?"Stewart beamed. "I apologeese, Mac," he said, "noo gie me the coatie.""Hoo muckle hae ye sunk?" demanded the generous giver, much taken aback."Full five feet," came the smiling answer. "Mac, ma vera dear freen,ye've made a ser'us mistak' this time."Mac stood as if transfixed, gazing appealingly at Phil, who seemedequally amazed; then he turned without a word and rushed out to theshaft. When he came back a moment later, he stripped off the coat andhanded it to Stewart. "I'm prood o' ye, ma man," he said with an effort;"ye're an indiveedual o' muckle strategy."Then Phil joined in with commendable tact. "You've still got the hat,Mac," laughed he, "it's a fair divide."[Illustration: STEWART FINDS THE GROUND HARD.]WE "STRIKE" GOLDFor over a week sinking operations on the Five-Mile Flat were continuedwith unabated vigour, and then a hush of expectation seemed to fall overthe community, for the miners in the shallow ground at the head of thelead were nearing bottom, and the vast array who had pegged along thesupposed course of the auriferous wash ceased their labours and waitedin tremulous eagerness for reports from Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, belowDiscovery. There was good reason for anxiety. If these claims bottomedon pipe-clay deposits or other barren clayey formations, little hopecould be entertained for those who had followed their line of guidance.The direction of the golden channel certainly could not be ascertainedby judging the lie of the country on the surface, for it was almostabsolutely flat, and bore not the slightest resemblance to the originalcountry far beneath. Practical tracing from claim to claim was the onlymethod by which a miner could safely calculate, and that meant thatthose a little way off the first proved shaft, and all followingclaim-holders, must either be possessed of a vast amount of hope andenergy or an equal amount of patience. It is not unusual, also, to finda deep lead suddenly "fizzle" out with little warning; and again, itseldom fails to create consternation and disappointment at an anxioustime by shooting off at right angles, or diverging into numerousinfinitesimal leaderettes.So it was that when the first flush of excitement had died awayattention was turned to those claims mentioned, and for the time allwork was suspended. We, at No. 7, were still several feet above thelevel at which we had calculated to find bottom. Since Stewart soperemptorily burst out the ironstone bar we had encountered nothing buta series of sand formations, which we managed to crash through at therate of five feet each day, and now our shaft measured fully forty-onefeet in depth.My companions worked like Trojans in their efforts to reach gold-payinggravel before their neighbours. Neither Stewart nor Mac had theslightest fear of our shaft proving a duffer, and their extremeconfidence was so infecting that Phil forswore many of his petgeological theories in order to fall into line with their ideas. "Afterall," he said to me, "geological rules seem to be flatly contradicted bythe arrangement of the formations here, and only the old adage holdsgood, that an ounce of practice is worth a ton of theory.""It looks that way," I answered, "yet I do not like the look of theseenormous bodies of sandstone. If I were to go by my experience in othercountries, I should promptly forsake this ground and look for morepromising tracts."We were standing by the windlass pulling up the heavy buckets ofconglomerate material which Mac was picking below with much gusto. Theglare of the sun reached barely half-way down the shaft, and thesolitary worker was beyond our gaze, but well within hearing,nevertheless, for his voice rumbled up from the depths in strongprotest."I'll no hae mae idees corrupted wi' sich fulish argiment. Naitur haswyes o' her ain, an' whaur golologists think gold is, ye may be surethere's nane; bit whaur it raelly is, there ignorant golologists insistit insna. There's nae pleasin' some fouk."We kept silence, and, after waiting vainly for our comment, Mac againattacked the solid sandstone with sullen ferocity.The air was close and sultry, and the dumps thrown up from the manyshafts around glistened in the intense light and crumbled off into theheat haze as filmy clouds of dust. The entire landscape seemed as abiographic picture, and affected the eyes in similar degree. It was atypical Westralian day. Thud! thud! went Mac's pick, and now and thencame a grunt of annoyance from that perspiring individual as anunusually refractory substance would temporarily defy his strength.We leaned against the windlass barrel, awaiting his call of "Bucket!"which would intimate that further material was accumulated below, andready for discharge into the outer air. Few men were about, unless atNo. 2 shaft, where there was much activity. On the adjoining lot ourfriend of the leathery skin--who rejoiced in the title of "EmuBill"--dozed under the shade of a rudely-erected wigwam."It's a bit warm," ventured Phil. He was not quite sure of his ground,and did not wish to exaggerate."It's d--d hot!" rolled a well-known voice from the depths, and Stewartwithin the tent sang gaily an adaption from "Greenland's icy mountains."When quiet was restored I looked again towards No. 2, and at that momenta red handkerchief fluttered to the top of a tiny flagpole surmountingthe windlass, and hung limp. A moment later a long, hoarse cheer sweptthe flat from end to end, and, as if by magic, each claim appeared fullymanned, and a sea of faces turned in our direction. No. 2 had signalled,"On Gold.""Staun by the windlass! I'm comin' up!" roared Mac, who had vaguelyheard the sound-waves pass overhead and was wondering what had happened."Gold struck on No. 2, Mac!" I shouted, and Phil, who had not quiteunderstood, staggered in amazement, loosening with his feet a quantityof sand and rubble which descended with much force on Mac's upturnedface, and interrupted a second passionate appeal to "Staun by thewindlass!""I'll hae yer life fur that, ye deevil!" he spluttered. "Ye did it onpurpose."Then Stewart came upon the scene in great haste. "I tell't ye sae! Itell't ye sae!" he cried, and for the especial benefit of his isolatedcompanion he bellowed down, "They've got gold at number twa, Mac! Oceanso't!"Mac was then half-way to the surface, with one foot resting in the emptybucket attached to the cable, and both hands gripping the strong wirerope, which strained and rasped as it slowly coiled on the wooden drum.He was no light weight, and Phil and I felt our muscles twitch as weheld against the windlass arm at each dead centre, for there was noratchet arrangement attached to prevent a quick rush back, and our heavybucket-load made the safety of his position somewhat doubtful by swayingthe rope impatiently, and indulging in other restless antics.However, when he came near the light and saw how matters stood he becamequiet as a lamb; but the sight of his face smeared with the grime sorecently deposited upon it, and wearing an intensely savage expression,was too much for our gravity, and our efforts faltered."Hang on, ye deevils!" pathetically implored he, as he felt himselftremble in the balance. Then seeing Stewart's face peering down uponhim, he besought his aid. "Staun by the winlass, Stewart, ma man," heentreated, "or I'll never see auld Scotland again."But Stewart was at that moment seized with a paroxysm of laughter. Theappeal was vain, and his comrade, being now near _terra firma_, andcomparatively safe, again addressed him."Git oot o' ma sicht, ye red-heided baboon!" said he. "Nae wuner theycouldna work the winlass wi' you staunin' aside them."It is an unwritten law on most goldfields throughout the world where theindividual miner tries his luck that a flag be at once hoisted overevery shaft that bottoms on paying gravel. It is a pretty custom, and agenerous one to the less fortunate diggers, who judge by the progressingline of flags whether their own remote claims may have a chance ofintercepting the golden channel. As it happened in this case, No. 2shaft could hardly have failed to pick up the lead, which had beentraced in its direction to the boundaries of Discovery claim. Still,there was much rejoicing when the red symbol went up, and for the restof the day a renewed activity was in force to the uttermost end of theFlat. Even "Emu Bill," as our near neighbour was picturesquely styled,felt called upon to do a little work; but, as he took care to explain,he did it only to satisfy mining regulations, which demand that acertain amount of labour must be performed each day. "You'll notice,"said he, "that 3, 4, and 5 hiv tacked on d'reckly in line--as theythought--an' you'll furrer notice thishyer propperty, No. 6, an' yerown, No. 7, hiv not exzactly played foller the leader." Which was true;for Emu Bill's claim had taken only a diagonal guidance from itspredecessor, and ours continued the altered route, while those followingvaried considerably between the two angles thus given."When you sees a flag floatin' on No. 3, boys," continued hemeditatively, "it's time to pack up your traps, an', as I said afore, Ibelieve in waitin' events an' jedgin' accordin'.""Hoo lang hae you been diggin' holes in this countrie, Leatherskin?"Stewart politely inquired. And he of the weary countenance chewed hisquid reflectively for several minutes ere he made reply."I reckon over a dozen years," he said at length, "in which time Iperspected Coolgardie an' Kalgoorlie wi' old Pat Hannan when there wasnothin' but niggers within' a couple of hundred miles of us.""A'm o' the opeenion," announced Mac, "that what Mr. Leatherskin disnaken aboot the vagaries o' his ain playgrun' is no worth menshun.""Seven is supposed to be a lucky number," spoke Phil, "and I think itwill prove so with us."After which Emu Bill went back to slumber, and Phil went down to labourin the shaft. "You've got tae mind," instructed Mac, who manipulated hisdescent, "when you want the bucket jist lift up yer voice tae thateffeck, and I'll drap it doon gently on the end o' the rope."Phil promised, and was speedily lowered into the darkness, and Mac,neglecting his post at once, came round into the tent, where Stewart andmyself were trying hard to find a half-hour's oblivion in the realms ofdreamland, and the myriad flies buzzing everywhere were trying equallyhard, and with greater success, to prevent our succumbing to the softinfluence. Mac's entrance at this moment was particularly distasteful tohis comrade, who was just on the verge of sweet unconsciousness, andwhose essayed snores were beginning to alarm the flies besieging hisface."Go awa' oot this meenit, Mac," said he, opening his eyes, "and tak' yerbig feet aff ma stummick at aince."Just then a far-away cry of "Bucket" was vaguely heard, and calmlyignored by the new-comer. "Stewart, ma man," he began, sitting down on aportion of the weary one's anatomy, "I wis wantin' tae get yer idees onone or twa maitters o' scienteefic interest.""Get out, Mac!" I ordered. But he seemed not to hear, and another hoarsecall for "Bucket" passed unobserved."I wis wantin', for instance," he continued earnestly, "tae speak wi' yeser'usly on metapheesical quest-shuns----""Let me alane!" Stewart howled, writhing in torment. But his visitor wasnot to be shaken off.Five minutes later a stentorian yell from the shaft intimated thatPhil's patience was being unduly strained, and Mac reluctantly desistedfrom expounding further the intricacies of science, and rose to go. Asmay be understood, the bottom of a narrow and deep pit is not the mostpleasant of places in which to idle away the time, and Phil, afterdigging as much as the limited area of operations would allow, wasfilled with wrath at the neglect of his associate, and cursed thatworthy gentleman with fervour between his shouts. "Bucket!" he roared,for the twentieth time, and Mac, who was then scrambling towards thewindlass, inwardly commented on the unusual savageness of the voice."He's a wee bit annoyed," he murmured. "I'll better try an' propeetiatehim." So he leaned his head over the shaft mouth and whispered inwinning tones, "Are ye vera faur doon, Pheel-up?""Lower away the bucket, you flounder-faced mummy!" came the promptreply, which penetrated the darkness in sharp staccato syllables.Mac looked pained. "Noo, if that had been Stewart," he muttered grimly,"I wud a kent weel what tae dae, bit being the golologist----" He shookhis head feebly, and reached for the hide bucket, which was lying near.Then, forgetting in the flurry of the moment to hitch it on to the rope,he let it descend at the fastest speed the law of gravity would permit."Staun frae under!" he yelled, realising too late what he had done; butin such a narrow space there was no room for dodging, and the leathernreceptacle struck the unfortunate man below with more force than wasagreeable. "Ye brocht it on yersel'," consolingly spoke Mac. "It's aveesitation o' Providence fur miscain' me sae sairly."The words that greeted his ears were eloquent and emphatic, and hemarched into the tent in high dudgeon. "Gang an' pull the golologist ooto' the shaft," said he to Stewart. "He's in the position o' a humourist,an' he canna see throo't."Perhaps there are few who could have smiled and looked pleasant undersimilar circumstances; but the "golologist" was of a forgiving nature,and his enmity dissolved when he reached the surface."You'll admit, Mac," he said, after allowances had been made on bothsides, "that I had some slight cause for grumbling, and in yourmagnanimity you might have spared me your last forcible addition to theargument.""That wis a mistak'," Mac replied apologetically. "I had the baggie inma haun, meanin' tae send it doon in orthodox manner; bit yer injudishusremarks made me nervish, and doon it drappit, sudden-like."After these explanations peace reigned again; but Stewart's rest hadbeen so rudely broken that he now thought to work off his lassitude byan hour's graft with the pick. We had arranged ourselves into shifts,which went on and off alternately, or otherwise, as we thought fit; butit was my plan to reach bedrock without delay, so the shaft was neverallowed to remain long unoccupied. Leaving Mac and Phil to attend toculinary matters, I went out with Stewart, and, after lowering him intothe Stygian gloom, kept watch by the windlass until the night closedover and Phil announced that tea was ready.[Illustration: NO. 2 CLAIM--JUST STRUCK GOLD.]Two more days passed uneventfully. The hourly-expected bulletin of goodnews from No. 3 was being long deferred, and vague fears were beginningto be expressed that all was not satisfactory there. It was known thatNos. 3, 4, and 5 had put on extra shifts in the last few nights, and thedepths of their sinkings must at this time have exceeded fifty feet. Weat No. 7 awaited developments with keen interest. It was natural that weshould hope for the worst at No. 3, for, as Emu Bill had said, we wereon an entirely different tack, and might cease our labours when thegaudy emblem appeared over that claim. In these two days progress hadbeen very slow with us, for a hard bar of conglomerate quartz hadintervened at the 45-foot level, and we dared not use gelignite in casethe heavy discharge might bring the upper walls inward and render ourwhole work useless.It is always precarious to use blasting powder of any description at thedeep levels of an alluvial shaft, and the more so when the upperformations have proved to be of non-cohesive nature. So we werecompelled to laboriously pick the unyielding mass where we might, andotherwise drill and shatter it with hammers.On the morning of the third day after the flag had been raised at No. 2the Emu seemed to awake from his lethargy in earnest, and set to workwith right good-will to make up for lost time."You wasn't wrong in takin' my advice arter all, mate," he said to me,when I appeared to inquire the reason of his unwonted activity."There's no flag up at No. 3 yet," I answered tentatively."No, nor won't be, nuther," he returned with evident satisfaction. "Itell you what, mate," he continued impressively, "the first flag thatgoes up will be at your own shaft, No. 7, so you'd better get yourflagpole ready. The man what says I don't know this country is a liar,every time."Yet still the men at the shafts in question continued to dig deeper anddeeper. "We hasn't reached bottom yet," they said, in answer to allquestions, and on that point they appeared decided."I'll go up and pint out the evil o' their ways," Emu Bill said, comingover to us after midday. "I don't believe in no man exartin' hissel' tono good." Then he addressed himself to Mac far below: "I say, Scottie,you're going to strike it first, and good luck to you, you hard-workingsinner.""Same to you, Leatherskin, an mony o' them," a voice from the depthsreplied gruffly, for the "hard-working sinner" had but imperfectlyunderstood.Leaving Phil in charge of the windlass, I accompanied Emu Bill to theshafts he now considered doomed. "Look at the stuff they're takin' out,"said he, drawing my attention to a heap of white and yellow cement-likesubstance; "the beggars have gone clean through the bedrock and don'tknow it."The men at the windlass eyed us savagely as we came near, and Iexperienced for a moment a malicious joy when I noticed ouruncommunicative visitor among them. "We don't want no more opinions,"one of their number cried; "we knows we hasn't struck bottom yet.""Mates," said Emu Bill, with dignity, "I hiv sunk more duffers than tharbe years in my life--an' I'm no chicken--an' I tells ye straight, you'venot only struck bottom, but you've gone three or four feet past it. Ifyou means to tunnel through to Ole England, that's your business, but ifnot, you'd better give it best."Without further words, we retraced our steps, my companion fuminginwardly because of his brusque reception. Yet his advice must have haddue effect, for that evening the unfortunately-placed shafts were beingdismantled and late in the night the all too sanguine owners strucktheir camps and departed for other fields. Their disappointment waskeen. They had missed fortune by only a few yards.Next morning all the Flat knew that Nos. 3, 4, and 5 had duffered out,and, as a result, there was a great exodus of those who had been guidedby these locations; but, on the other hand, rejoicings were the order ofthe day with the miners who believed Nos. 6 and 7 to mark the truecontinuation of the lead, which had last been proved at the secondworkings.Our claim was then the cynosure of all eyes, for the Emu's shaft was yetbarely six feet deep, and we were supposed to be close on the dreadedbottom. I was convinced that we should know our luck immediately theironstone bar was penetrated, and that obstruction was not likely tohinder us much longer."I'll be the man that'll see gold first," Mac announced confidently, ashe shouldered his pick after breakfast and prepared to take first shift."I've got a rale bonnie flag to pit up when ye're ready," said Stewart,displaying an imposing-looking Union Jack which had done service atKlondike, and which he had been surreptitiously repairing for some dayspast.Phil was silent. "I sincerely hope we may not be disappointed," he saidat length. Like me, he could not understand the presence of therefractory formation so close upon auriferous wash--if the latterreally existed in our claim."Geological rules don't count in this country, Phil," I suggestedhopefully; then Mac departed, grumbling loudly at what he was pleased tocall my "Job's comfortings."For the best part of the forenoon I listened to the thudding of the pickwith an anxious interest, for any stroke now might penetrate to themysterious compound known as the cement wash; but the blows still runghard and clear, and I grew weary waiting. It was not necessary to sendthe bucket below often. Though Mac smote the flinty rock with all hisstrength, and a vigour which few could have sustained, the result of hislabours was almost infinitesimal. Every half-hour Stewart would receivefrom his perspiring companion a blunted pick, hoisted up on the end ofthe cable, while a fresh one was provided to continue the onslaught. Macseemed tireless, and Stewart above, at a blazing fire, practised all hissmithy art to keep the sorely-used tools in order; while ever and anon ahoarse voice would bellow from the underground, "Mak' them hard,Stewart, ma man. Mind that it is no butter A'm diggin'.""You must come up, Mac," I said, when one o'clock drew near, but hewould not hear of it. "I ken I hivna faur tae gang noo," he cried. "Ican hear the sound gettin' hollow."Another ten minutes passed, and now I could distinctly note a differencein the tone of the echoes ringing upwards. Thud! Thud! Thud! went thepick, and Mac's breath came in long deep gasps, that made Stewart ravewildly at the severe nature of his comrade's exertions.Then suddenly there was a crash, followed by a shout of joy. Mac hadbottomed at last.For several moments complete silence reigned; then a subdued scrapingbelow indicated that Mac was collecting some of the newly-exposedstratum for analysis."What does it look like?" I whispered down. There are few indeed whocould withstand a touch of the gold fever at such a critical time, and Iwas impatient to know the best or the worst; either report would haveallayed the indescribable feeling that possessed me then. The mosthardened goldseeker is not immune from the thrill created when bottomhas been reached; at that moment he is at one with the veriest novicewho eagerly expects to view gold in its rough state for the first time.My companion did not at once gratify my longing for knowledge, and whenhe replied, Phil, Stewart, and myself were peering down into the shaftawaiting intelligence with breathless interest."I think," he muttered, in tones that struck upon our ears as a knell ofdoom, "I raelly think--ye micht keep yer heids oot o' the licht.""Mac!" I admonished, "remember this is no time for pleasantries.""Weel, weel," he responded apologetically, "I wis wantin' tae giecorrect infurmashun, bit the glint aff Stewart's pow mak's a' thingcoloured." Stewart promptly drew back his head with a howl of rage."Mak' nae mair refleckshuns!" he cried indignantly.There came a creak at the windlass rope as Mac put his foot into thehalf-filled bucket and prepared to ascend; then his voice rolled up tous again. "Wha's makin' refleckshuns? I was only makin' menshun o' thebonnie auburn----""Shut up, Mac," Phil interrupted, and Mac obligingly cut short hissoliloquy and roared--"Staun by the windlass, ye deevils, I'm comin' up wi' specimens!"If he had had cause at one time to comment on the slow and uncertainnature of his upward flight, he assuredly had no room for complaint inthat direction on this occasion. All three of us went to the windlassand yanked our comrade to the surface at a rate that caused him muchconsternation. Then I seized the bucket, which contained a few pounds ofan alarmingly white-looking deposit, and hurried with it into the tent,where the gold-pan, freshly scrubbed, lay waiting beside a kerosene tinhalf filled with muddy water. On closer examination the samples lookeddecidedly more promising; little granules of quartz were interspersedwith the white cement, and a sprinkling of ironshot particles were alsoin evidence. We had struck an alluvial wash: that was clear enough, andnow the question was--would it prove to be auriferous? Without speakingwe commenced to crush the matrix into as fine a powder as possible, andwhen that operation was completed, the whole was emptied into thegold-pan."It looks just like sugar," Stewart broke out, "an' no near so dirty asKlonduk gravel.""Get your flag ready," I said, "we'll know our luck in a few minutes." Inow filled the pan with water, and began to give it that concentricmotion so familiar to those who search for the yellow metal. Gradually,very gradually, the water was canted off, carrying with it the bulk ofthe lighter sands, and finally the residue was left in the form of someounces of black ironstone powder, which, because of its weight, hadremained, and about an equal amount of coarse quartz grains that hadescaped crushing."But I don't see any gold," said Phil despondingly."Ye're faur too impatient," Mac reproved. "Ye didna expec' tae see itfloatin' on tap o' a' that stuff surely?"I tilted the pan obliquely several times in order to make the contentsslide round in the circular groove provided, and as it slowly movedunder the gentle pressure of the little water remaining, it left aglittering trail in its wake, which caused my three companions to breakout in a whoop of delight.Some sixty seconds later the Union Jack floated bravely above ourwindlass, and was hailed with a thunder of applause.CAMP-FIRE REMINISCENCESFor many weeks work went on merrily. One after another the variousclaims reached paying gravel, and flags of all designs and colours soonmarked the course of the lead for fully half a mile, after whichdistance the golden vein effectually eluded discovery; it had apparentlydisappeared into the bowels of the earth. For the first few dayssucceeding our location of the auriferous wash we contented ourselves indollying the more easily disintegrated parts of the white conglomerate,and collecting the solid and cumbrous blocks excavated into sacks, eachof which when filled weighed over a hundred pounds. These I meant tosend to some crushing battery when several tons had been raised.The water for dollying as well as for all other purposes was obtainedfrom a deep shaft sunk near at hand by a speculative individual, whoconsidered that water might ultimately pay him as generously as gold,and as he charged eightpence a gallon for the brackish fluid, and had anunlimited demand for it at that, he probably found it a less troublesomeand much more lucrative commodity than even a moderately wealthy claimon the Five-Mile Lead. As it so happened, however, when other claimsbegan to copy our tactics and dolly portions of their wash, it was madeevident that the water bore was not equal to the strain, and once ortwice it ran dry at a most critical time. After a careful computation ofits capacity we saw that it could only be drawn upon for domesticpurposes in future, and even then there was every probability of thesupply giving out if a good rainfall did not soon occur to moisten theland and percolate to the impervious basin tapped by the bore inquestion.[Illustration: OUR SHAFT.]At this time a public battery, owned by a limited company, was doingyeoman service to the dwellers on an alluvial field some five milessouth of us; and after much consideration we, in common with the most ofthe miners, arranged to despatch our golden gravel thither, as being theonly way out of a difficulty. Public batteries exist all over thosegoldfields, for, owing to the absence of water, a prospector can rarelydo more than test samples of his find, and thereby estimate its value;and these public crushing plants are, therefore, a very necessaryadjunct to his success.The time passed pleasantly enough now that the trying uncertainty of thefirst fortnight was no longer with us, and the auriferous channel wasbeing slowly and surely tunnelled and cut in every conceivabledirection. Work was pursued in matter-of-fact fashion. The glamour ofthe goldseeker's life had departed with the risk.Yet when the practical and perhaps sordid work of the day was done, andwe gathered together around one or other of the numerous camp fires, itseemed as if a new world had descended upon us when daylight gave placeto the mystic glimmer of the lesser stars and the steadfast radiance ofthe glorious Southern Cross. Only the world-wanderer who has sleptbeneath all skies can truly appreciate the grandeur of the southernconstellations. The bushman has grown to love them from his infancy;they have been his companions on many a weary journey, and he regardsthem with an almost sacrilegious familiarity. But to the traveller fromother lands these shining guideposts in the heavens arouse a feelingakin to reverence, and later, when he ventures into his grim desertland and trusts his life to their constancy, his admiration, were itpossible, increases tenfold. There is, of course, one great reason forthe stranger's attachment to the sky sentinels of an Australian nightother than their calm, clear brilliance. In no other country is thewanderer brought so close, as it were, to the luminaries of night. InCanada, Alaska, America, India, or China, or, indeed, in any portion ofthe globe, by reason of climatic or other conditions, one must perforcesleep under canvas, and in some cases where the cold is severe--as inAlaska--the shelter of a heavily-logged hut is almost a necessity. Butin the inland parts of Australia, where rain seldom falls, and where nopestilence taints the atmosphere, the sky alone usually forms thetraveller's roof. Many times have I gone to sleep in the great silentinterior with only my coat for a pillow, and coaxed myself into slumberwhile watching for the advent of a favourite star, or tracing thegradual course of the Southern Cross.To me the stars of the south have a peculiar significance. When I gazedat them, even while divided from civilisation by over a thousand milesof dreary arid sand plains, I felt comforted, for though compass andsextant may fail, the stars will still show the way.I recall our evenings spent at the Five-Mile Camp with deepest pleasure.There only did I meet and talk with the typical men of the West, and thesimple, true-hearted, restless spirits of the Island Continent who havepushed the outposts of their country far into the desert. It was my oneexperience of a Western Australian mining camp, and afterwards, duringour weary wanderings in the far interior, we often longed for thecompany of the generous-minded men who used to gather round our fire andreview their early experiences with such vivid effect.Emu Bill, I have already mentioned, but there were several others whomwe came to know during the later days of our sojourn at the golden flat,and they had all their own peculiar characteristics, with a sterlinghonesty of purpose as the keynote of their lives."Old Tom," I remember, possessed an interest in the claim next to ours;not much of an interest it was, either, for he was too old a man to havecome in nearly first in the rush. He had simply been promised apercentage of returns in No. 8 for doing all the work thereon; and as atfirst the presence of gold there was much doubted, it was no greatgenerosity on the part of the owner of the lot to promise slight rewardand no wages for labour done. Yet for once Old Tom scored in a bargain,and his labours were not, as he cheerfully said they had ever been,wholly vain.Old Tom must have been a splendid specimen of manhood in his day; now hewas nearly seventy years of age, and his bent shoulders detractedsomewhat from his great stature, while his slightly-bowed legs--whosedeviation from the perpendicular, he insisted, had been caused by muchwalking--gave to him a more frail appearance than was justified.His knowledge of his own country was extensive, but he had fallen intothe strange belief that the world began at Australia, and that Europe,Asia, and other portions of the globe were merely remote colonies ordependencies of his own land. "I hiv walked all over Australia, mates,"he used to say; "I know the world well.""You ought to see London, Tom," I said, one night, after he had beenrecounting his travelling experiences; but he shook his head."It's too far to walk," he replied sadly; "Old Tom's walking days arenearly over. But," and he brightened considerably, "I've heard tell thatLunnon is full o' people, an' there wouldn't be no room for an old manlike me to peg his claim."It was one of his fixed ideas that the whole world was but a goldfieldon which all men had to try their luck. And the sea had its terrors forhim, as it has for nearly all bushmen, although most of them getaccustomed to it sooner or later. With Old Tom it would be never. "Iwent on a ship once," he admitted, "when I was a young 'un, an' themem'ry o't will never leave me." He shuddered at the recollection of hissufferings. "I kin walk 'bout as fast as a ship, anyway," he added withmuch satisfaction, "an' a hundred miles more or less don't make muchdifference when Old Tom is on the wallaby."At another time, when news of Kitchener's brilliant successes in theSoudan had reached us, I read out to him from an old home newspaperdetails of the capture of Omdurman. There were many around the fire thatnight, and all listened eagerly to the thrilling narrative except OldTom; he gazed listlessly into the glowing fire, and smoked his pipeunmoved."Have you no interest in these things, Tom?" I asked."It's a long time since I've been in the Eastern Colonies," he answeredslowly, "an' I hiv lost my bearin's among them names. Soudan is inQueensland, isn't it? Or mebbe it is west'ard in Noo South Wales?" PoorOld Tom! he had fought the aborigines times without number, and takenhis life in his hands on many a lone trail, yet he would have beensurprised had anyone said that he was more than usually venturesome. Heknew no fear, and acted his weary part in life nobly and well.[Illustration: NUGGETY DICK AND SILENT TED.]"Silent Ted" was another of our camp-fire comrades; he was, as his nameimplied, not a talkative individual. Long years spent in the bush hadserved to dry up the vials of his speech. Yet he was not morose ortaciturn by nature; he simply seemed too tired to give expression to histhoughts. His eyes were ever fixed and emotionless as the desertsands--sure evidence of the bushman who has lived in the drearywilderness beyond the Darling. He had been a long time in striking gold,and we all thought his shaft was likely to prove a duffer; but despiteour gloomy prophecies he joined our evening circle night after night,and smoked his pipe cheerful as usual, though that was not saying much."I forgot to tell you, mates," he broke out one evening, to our greatsurprise, "that I struck bottom yesterday."He meant to say more, but his mouth closed with a click in spite ofhimself, and in reply to our congratulations he handed round forexamination two fine specimens of alluvial gold which he had taken fromhis first day's tests, and when they had been inspected by the communityand returned to him, he passed them on to his neighbour with a sigh; hehad apparently already forgotten their existence.The devil-may-care fossicker, also, was well represented, and hisspecies rejoiced in cognomens so euphonious and varied that I couldnever remember the correct titles to bestow upon their several owners,and only realised my mistakes when greeted with reproachful glances.Among our acquaintances were, "Dead Broke Sam," a proverbiallyunfortunate miner in a perpetual state of pecuniary embarrassment;"Lucky Dave," who always "came out on top;" "Happy Jack," who seemed tofind much cause for merriment in his rather commonplace existence; and"Nuggety Dick," who at all times could unearth one or two specimens fromsome secret place in his meagre wardrobe, and describe minutely wherethey had been obtained--usually some place comprehensively indicated as"away out back."These gaunt, bearded men had many strange stories to tell, and in theruddy firelight they would trace on the sand intricate charts emblematicof their wanderings. They were those whose roving natures compelledthem to follow up every gold rush, with the firm belief thatextraordinary fortune would one day crown their efforts. "It's a durnedhard life, boys," Dead Broke Sam, who worked with Old Tom on similarterms of remuneration, would often say, looking round for thesympathetic chorus that was always forthcoming, "but if we doesn't pegout, we is bound to strike it some day."There is no blasphemy in the speech of the Australian miner. The mostrugged-looking fossicker is gentle as a lamb, save when unduepresumption on the part of some new chum, or "furriner," arouses hisire, and then he makes things hum generally; but his forcible words aremerely forcible, and perhaps "picturesque," but nothing more; the inaneprofanity of the Yankee fortune-seeker finds no exponent in theAustralian back-blocker.Many were the tales "pitched" on these long starlit nights, andnarratives of adventure in search of gold, and hairbreadth escapes fromthe aborigines succeeded each other until the evening was far spent, andthe Southern Cross had sunk beyond the horizon. Then we would dispersewith a monosyllabic "night, boys," all round, and seek our separatesandy couches.My comrades, Mac and Stewart, were shining satellites at these meetings,and weird stories from the Pampas plains and the Klondike valley formedat intervals a pleasing change--from the miners' point of view--to theaccounts of gold-finds, and rushes, and hostile natives, so fluentlydescribed by Nuggety Dick and Co. And now and then a whaling anecdotewould lend zest to the gathering, faithfully told by Stewart with muchdramatic effect; he was, indeed, a past master at the art, and neverfailed to hold his audience spellbound.Emu Bill, though recognised by all as the most experienced minerpresent, rarely condescended to spin a yarn, and he listened to his_confrères'_ tales with ill-concealed impatience, but showed a decidedliking for my two warriors' romances. One evening, however, he broke hisreserve and proceeded to give a rambling survey of his wanderings, andas he warmed to his subject his eyes began to glow, and his gesturesbecame eloquent and impassioned."Yes, boys," said he, winding up a _resumé_ of his exploits in variousparts of Australia, "I calc'late I hev had a fair-sized experience o'gold mining in my time, an' as ye may guess, I hevn't allus come outright end up, nuther, else I shouldn't be here. Thank the Lord! I'vestruck something at last.""I'm wi' ye thar, mate," grunted Old Tom in sympathy. "I guess this isOld Tom's last rise."Then a silence fell over the little assembly, during which Emu Bill drewfanciful diagrams in the sand with an improvised camp poker, and SilentTed almost went to sleep. The rest of us gazed at Emu Bill with a showof interest, expecting him to proceed with his reminiscences, and soonhe started again."Yes, boys, I've had my disappintments, as we've all had, I opine, but Ihad an un-common disappintment at the time o' the Kalgoorlie Rush----""Kalgoorlie Rush, Bill?" I exclaimed. "Were you in that?""Wur I in that?" he echoed dismally. "I wur, an' I wurn't, which is notmebbe a very plain statement, but you kin jedge fur yourself if you careto hear my yarn.""Let her go, Bill," said Nuggety Dick."I'm listenin' wi' vera great interest," Mac spoke slowly. "Ye've been aman o' pairts, Emoo."After sundry expressions of approval had been elicited, Bill againpicked up the thread of his narrative."You've heard o' old Hannan, of course," he began, "the diskiverer o'Kalgoorlie? The diskiverer o' Kalgoorlie!" he repeated, mimicking ageneral expression often heard on the fields. "Well, boys, I kin tellyou how Kalgoorlie was diskivered.... Pat Hannan an' me had been matesfor a considerable time. We walked from South'ron Cross together aforethe railway, an' we 'specked around Coolgardie camp wi' fairish success.There was no township at Coolgardie then, boys, though that jumped upquick enough. One day we thought we'd jine a party as was going outeastward to 'speck for gold furrer back in the nigger country; an' aftergettin' our water-bags filled an' provisions for a month rolled up inour swags, we all cleared out. In two days we camped at Kalgoorlie well.You know where that is, boys; but there was nary a shanty withintwenty-five miles of it then, nothin' but sand an' black boys, an' hostso' nigs. But we never thought o' lookin' for gold there, worse luck; atleast, none o' the rest did; but old Hannan had a skirmish round' an'reported nary sign o't, so we struck camp at oncet. But jest as we wurmovin' off, Hannan comes to me with a twist on his mug an' snickers,'Bill, me bhoy, phwat can I do? Me water-bag's bust!' Now that wur aser'us matter, for we needed all the water we could carry, not knowin'when another well might turn up, so I voted we shid all camp again untilPat's water-bag had been repaired, an' the rest o' the boys of courseagreed, unan'mous. But that wouldn't suit old Hannan, 'Ye'd better goon, boys,' said he, 'an' I'll come after yez in half an hour.' So wewent on; but though we went slow, and arterards waited fur half a day,no Hannan turned up, an' we had to continue our journey without him.Well, boys, we came back in less'n a fortnight, arter trampin' about inthe durnedest country on God's earth in search o' water an' findin'none. We hadn't time to look fur gold, so ye kin guess we wur mightymiserable when we drew near to the place where old Hannan's water-baghad busted; but the appearance o' the camp sort o' mystified us, tharwur rows an' rows o' tents, an' the ground was pegged fur miles.'Howlin' tarnation!' I yelled at the first man we came across. 'Is thisa mir-adge, or what has we struck?' 'Nary mir-adge, mate,' said he,'this is Hannan's Find, or Kalgoorlie if yous like that namebetter.' ... An' it wur a bitter fack, boys. Old Hannan musthave notised an outcrop somewheres around, an' being allfired afearedthat we, his mates, might get too much benefit, he had ripped thewater-bag on purpose so as to get an excoose fur waitin' behind. Then,of course, he had gone back to Coolgardie an' got the Governmentdiskivery reward, which otherwise would have been divided atween us. Butwe got nothin', boys, nary cent, an' nary square inch o' ground. Thecamp had been rushed when we wur sufferin' howlin' terrors out back....There's wan favour I'd ask of you, boys, don't none of you start 'Godblessin'' old Hannan for diskivering Kalgoorlie in my hearing. I can'tstand it, boys, an' you know why."Bill ceased, and a murmur of sympathy ran round the little group. TheKalgoorlie rush was fresh in the minds of nearly all present, many ofwhom had taken part in it. Every one knew Hannan, but who better thanhis one-time partner? and if his tale showed the much-honoured finder ofKalgoorlie in a less favourable light than that in which he was usuallyregarded, no one doubted Emu Bill's version of the story; yet it washard to dispel from the mind the glamour of romance associated with theevent from the first. One more illustration of the difference betweenthe real and the ideal, but it seems almost a pity to destroy theillusions, they lend so much colour and interest to otherwise sordidepisodes.The night was unusually dark, fleeting clouds constantly obscured thefeeble light of a slender crescent moon, and the myriad stars glimmeredfitfully. Our fire was the only cheerful object in the darkness, and itblazed and crackled, lighting up the weather-beaten faces of the circlearound it, and illuminating our tent in the background. For a long timeno one spoke, every man seemed gloomily affected by Bill's story, andwith chins resting on their hands they gazed into the vortex of theflaming logs long and earnestly.Then a familiar voice interrupted their reveries. "When Stewart an' mediscovered Gold Bottom Creek----""Go slow, Mac," I objected wearily; "it's getting late and we'd betterturn in.""It is wearin' on fur midnight," grunted Dead Broke Sam, surveying theheavens for the position of his favourite reckoning star."What was your last battery returns, mate?" asked Emu Bill, turning tome with a revival of practical interest."Fifty tons for 150 ounces," I replied."Not too bad," commented Nuggety Dick."I'm 20 tons fur 60 ounces," said my interrogator, "which is the sameratio. I guess Nos. 6 and 7 are the best properties on the Five Mile.""I'm 25 for 51," announced Happy Jack cheerfully."Thank the Lord, we've all got somethin'," Old Tom muttered devoutly, ashe rose to his feet. Then we went our several ways.[Illustration: HAPPY JACK AND DEAD-BROKE SAM.]THE "SACRED" NUGGETAt this time much interest was aroused by the report that anextraordinarily large nugget had been found within a few miles ofKanowna, an outlying township, but as the days passed and noconfirmation of the rumour was forthcoming, the miners throughout thewhole district decided to hold a court of inquiry and elicit the facts,or at least the foundations on which the panic-creating statement hadbeen based. As may be imagined, where gold is in question no rumour,however wild, is allowed to die a natural death. The miners _will_ siftand probe into the matter to the bitter end--and usually the end isbitter indeed to those who have been too eager to join the inevitablerush, and sink the almost equally inevitable duffer shafts.In the present case, however, the sifting process was speedily fruitfulof results. Tangible evidence was obtained that two men had been seenearly one morning carrying what seemed to be an enormous nugget in ablanket, some little distance from the settlement. Where the men camefrom with their find no one knew, and it was not likely that they wouldhave given the information had it been asked; but where they had goneafterwards promised to be an equally mysterious question; they hadvanished, leaving no trace or clue.The warden of the district professed complete ignorance of the entireaffair, and suggested that a practical joke had been played on thepeople; but this only served to make the miners unite in an outburst ofgenuine indignation. Already many shafts had been sunk in the mostunlikely places by men who could ill afford to labour in vain. The madenthusiasm created had had dire effect. Hundreds of men were floodinginto the camp daily from every quarter; work on all the leads had ceasedin anticipation of a rush. The joke, if joke it was, was indeed a cruelone, and its perpetrators deserved the wild denunciations that wereheaped upon them. "We'll lynch them!" roared the miners, and they meantit; but despite the utmost searching, the nugget-carriers--whose nameswere known--could not be found.Then just as excitement was dying out, when the people were all butconvinced that they had been hoaxed, and were preparing to return totheir various labours, confirmation of the rumour came from a mostunexpected quarter. A Roman Catholic priest publicly stated that he wasaware of the existence of the nugget, that he had been under a promiseof secrecy to the finders not to reveal its location for ten days, butthat owing to the extreme panic aroused he felt constrained to admit itsauthenticity, so that one doubt might be set at rest. As for thedistrict in which the great find had been made, he would give fullparticulars on the following Tuesday. He further gave out that thenugget weighed something over a hundred pounds, and was a perfectspecimen of true alluvial gold.The state of affairs after that can be better imagined than written.There promised to be a rush unequalled in the annals of goldfieldshistory. Men flocked into Kanowna in their thousands; excitement wasraised to fever heat; and the whole country seemed to await the comingof Tuesday.We, on the Five Mile, did not escape the prevalent craze. Our variousproperties were becoming worked out, and in any case who could resistbeing influenced by the mention of such a large nugget? The gold feveris, indeed, a rampant, raging disease which few can withstand."It'll be a bonnie run," said Stewart, "bit I can haud ma ain wi' onyman.""I think Phil could gie ye a sair tussle," commented Mac, "an' as furmasel'--I alloo naebody's sooperiority."But it was plain to all, long before the eventful day arrived, that therush for the Sacred Nugget, as it was called, would be totally differentfrom that in which we had taken part with so much success. And littlewonder. Since Father Long's announcement, horses and bicycles andbuggies of all descriptions were being held in readiness. No one had anotion how near or how far the rush might lead, but all seemeddetermined to have the speediest means of locomotion at their disposal.Under these circumstances my companions' running powers could availlittle, and I was not disposed to favour their desire to try their luckin the stampede."We've had enough of gold-mining, boys," I said, "and after we havefinished here I think we'll prospect further out." And the thought ofjourneying into the unknown back country pleased them mightily. It hadlong been my wish to explore the central parts of the great WesternColony, and I was seriously considering the feasibility of my planstowards that purpose when the Sacred Nugget excitement burst intoprominence, and for the time being served to demoralise my schemes."I don't think we ought to trouble with any new strike about here," Philsaid wearily. The monotony of the gold-seeker's life in WesternAustralia was beginning to affect even his usually buoyant nature."Don't go, boys," advised Emu Bill earnestly. "I is satisfied the thingisn't straight. Father Long or no Father Long, thar's been too muchmystery about the consarn. Thar's a ser'us hoax somewheres."It was a surprise to hear such advice from him. I thought of the timewhen I first saw him leading the rush to Five Mile, and unconsciously Ismiled. "In spite of what you say, I believe you'll be there yourself,Bill," I said. "I'm sure it would break your heart to be absent fromsuch an event.""I'm not deny'n' but you're right," he replied soberly. "Wi' me it's asort o' madness, but that don't affeck the honesty o' my remarks wanlittle bit.""Weel," began Mac with emphasis, "if ye dinna want tae gang, ye'll nogang. Stewart and me'll see efter that. I'll dae ye a kindness furaince, Emoo."We decided at last that Phil and I should go and view the "circus"--notto join in it by any means, but simply that we should see, and have ourcuriosity gratified; and so the matter rested. But on Tuesday morning,when Emu Bill saw the eager throngs passing inwards in the direction ofKanowna, his resolutions began to waver, and when the Five-Mile Flatalso began to show a deserted appearance, he came over to our tent witha mournful countenance."I is goin' with you arter all, mates," he said simply."Ye're gaun tae dae naething o' the sort, Emoo," roared Mac. "Did ye nopromise tae wait wi' Stewart an' me? No, ma man, fur yer ain guid we'llkeep ye here."And after much eloquent argument Bill resigned himself to his fate,almost cheerful at last to find his own views resisted so strongly. Butas Phil and I were starting out, he came to me with an eager light inhis eyes. "If you does think it's goin' to be any good," he said,"mention my name to Tom Doyle. He'll give you anything you want.Goodbye, boys, an'--an' good luck." And he was led away to be regaledwith stirring stories of other lands, by the masterful pair.The momentous announcement had been advertised to take place on Tuesday,at 3.30 p.m., from the balcony of the Criterion Hotel, and when wereached the township about midday we found the main thoroughfare ajostling mass of boisterous humanity; while cyclists in hundreds,lightly garbed as if for a great race, waited patiently in the sidestreet leading to the post-office, and in full view of themuch-advertised balcony. The cyclist element was composed of strangers,for the most part, who had cycled from Kalgoorlie and other settlementswithin a radius of twenty miles; hence their early arrival on the scene;they had timed themselves to be well ahead, so as to be fully restedbefore the fateful signal was given.As we forced our way through the crowd I could not help remarking thatthe majority had been imbibing over-freely to ensure rapidity of actionlater on. Indeed, it looked as if the Criterion Hotel, which formed thecentre of interest, was to be most benefited by the rush. It had notbeen by any means the most popular rendezvous of the miners, but on thisday it received a huge advertisement, and profited accordingly.We walked to the end of the street, where the bustle was considerablyless, and here we noticed a large wooden erection bearing the sign, "TomDoyle, Kanowna Hotel.""That is the name Bill mentioned," said Phil; "he seems a fairlyimportant individual in his own way. Suppose we interview him, or atleast have dinner in his mansion."To the latter part of the suggestion I was agreeable, and so in wewent. I had met Tom Doyle on several occasions since my arrival in thecountry; that gentleman was most ubiquitous in his habits, and had akeen scent for gold, so that his lanky figure might be expected anywherewhere good prospects had recently been obtained. He was also futuremayor of the camp, and so was, as Phil had put it, quite an importantindividual in his way; but how we could benefit by giving him Emu Bill'sname and compliments was more than I could understand.The hotel seemed to be completely empty; even the bar was deserted,which showed an extraordinary state of matters. "If Mac and Stewart werehere," laughed Phil, "there would be a repetition of the Indian villageraid I have heard so much about." Which I fear was only too true.However, we determined to give fair warning of our presence in theestablishment, and halloed out lustily; and at last a heavy footstepsounded in the room above."Doyle!" I cried, "Sir Thomas Doyle!""Lord Doyle!" added Phil, in a voice that might have awakened the sevensleepers."Phwat the thunder'n' blazes is yez yellin' at!" roared the object ofour inquiry, suddenly appearing on the stairway. Then he noticed thevacant bar. "Thunder'n' turf!" he muttered helplessly, "has all the shopcleared out after that d----d nugget?""Looks like it, Tom," I suggested. "Have you been asleep?""Av coorse. It's me afternoon siesta I was having. I'll be in time forthe rush all right, an' don't you forget it.""We didn't come to warn you about that," I said. "Emu Bill of the FiveMile said you had a few good horses----"[Illustration: READY FOR THE RUSH.]"Emoo Bill!" he howled."Same man," I admitted; "do you know him?""Does I know Emoo Bill? Well, I should smile. Why, me an' him were withHannan when that old skunk went back on us at the discovery ovKalgoorlie. Howly Moses! Poor owld Emoo! Horses, boys? Surely. I'm goin'to use 'Prince' myself, but yez can have the two steeplechasers, 'Satan'an' 'Reprieve.' I'll do that much for the Emoo; an' d----n the otherswho expect the horses."Events had certainly developed much more rapidly than I had anticipated;neither Phil nor myself had entertained the idea of joining in the rush.I had mentioned Emu Bill's message idly, never dreaming it would producesuch a prompt effect. Tom Doyle was a noted sporting man in thedistrict, a second Harry Lorrequer in a small way, and provided he wasnot drunk, he could break in even the most unruly horse when all othershad failed.The noise on the street was now becoming terrific; small armies ofminers bearing picks and stakes were arriving from the local diggings,and buggies and horses were being hurriedly equipped."We'll have a dhrop av the crater first," said Tom, noting thedisturbance outside, "and then we'll saddle up."Shortly afterwards we emerged from the hotel courtyard mounted on horsesthat were the pride of the countryside. Tom rode "Prince," apowerful-limbed, coal-black cob of sixteen hands; Phil bestrode "Satan,"a fiery Australian brumby; and I clung to "Reprieve," an impetuoushigh-stepping bay. "Keep at my heels, boys," cried Tom, as he startedoff at a canter, and it was at once evident that if we could keep at hisheels we should be in at the death without a doubt. It was slightlyafter three o'clock, and when we reached the scene of excitement wefound the street absolutely blocked. There must have been severalthousand men packed like sardines right across the broad passage, and onthe outskirts of this vast crowd over a hundred cyclists stood ready;beyond them still, a line of horsemen were drawn up, in numbersexceeding a regimental squadron.Scores of buggies and other spidery racing contrivances were scatterednear at hand, and extended far down the side street leading towards thepost-office. It was indeed an extraordinary sight. We formed up with theother horsemen, Tom's approach being hailed with loud cheers, for everyone knew the dare-devil Irishman."You'll get a broken neck this time, Tom," cried one of hisacquaintances cheerfully."I didn't know Prince was broken in to the saddle yet, Tom," saidanother."No more he isn't," replied Tom, "but he's broken enough for me. Standclear, bhoys."And then the black charger reared and bucked and curvetted wildly, whileits rider kicked his feet out of the stirrups and kept his seat like aCentaur. Few of the horses present had been much used before, and theynow became restive also, and pranced dangerously. Phil and I had a badfive minutes. We did not know the nature or temper of our mounts; andbesides, neither of us cared to place much reliance on our stirrupleathers, they looked frayed and wofully fragile."If they _go_ with yez, bhoys," advised Tom, "give 'em their heads.They'll get tired soon enough. Thar's lots o' room in this country.""Oh, Lord!" groaned Phil, "what a comfortable prospect we have beforeus! My back is about broken with this kicking brute already."The vast assembly was now becoming impatient. The stated time, 3.30,had been reached, and as yet there was no sign of the Reverend Fatherwho had been the cause of the extraordinary meeting. Then just asthreats and curses were being muttered, a pale-faced young man inclerical garb made his appearance on the balcony, and a deathlikestillness reigned in an instant. In a few words the priest explained hisstrange position, but he was rudely interrupted many times."It's gettin' late. Where did the nugget come from?" the rougher spiritsroared. The young man hesitated for a moment."The nugget was found on the Lake Gwinne track," he said, "at a depth ofthree feet----"With a long, indescribable roar the multitude scattered, and thespeaker's concluding words were drowned in the din. "Hold on!" criedTom, as Phil and I swung round to follow the main rush, "the d----didiots didn't wait to hear how _far_ it was from Lake Gwinne." There wasscarcely a dozen of us left; the breaking-up had been as the melting ofsummer snows."And the position is two miles from the lake," repeated the young man,wearily. Then Tom gave his horse a free rein and we followed suit.Lake Gwinne was a salt-crusted depression in the sand surface, aboutfive miles distant from the township, and in a very little frequentedvicinity. The so-called track towards it was nothing more than a windingcamel pad through the bush, and had the miners stopped to think, theywould have at once realised how insufficient was the data given. Withour additional information we were slightly better off; nevertheless Iwas not at all inclined to grow enthusiastic over our chances. Thedistrict mentioned had been very thoroughly prospected many monthsbefore, and with little success. "I think Father Long has been hoaxedafter all," I said to Phil, as we crashed through scrub and overironstone gullies in the wake of the main body, which we were rapidlyovertaking. But he could not reply; his horse was clearing the brush ingreat bounds, and as it had the bit between its teeth, my companionevidently had his work cut out for him.A few yards ahead Tom's great charger kept up a swinging gallop, andevery now and then that jolly roysterer would turn in the saddle andencourage us by cheery shouts. We soon passed the men who were hurryingon foot, but the buggies and the cycles were still in front. The sandsoil throughout was so tightly packed that it formed an ideal cyclepath, but the sparse eucalypti dotting its surface were dangerousobstacles, and made careful steering a necessity. The goldfield cyclist,however, is a reckless individual, and rarely counts the cost of hisadventurousness. Soon we came near to the cyclist army; the spokes oftheir wheels scintillated in the sunlight as they scudded over the openpatches. But one by one they dropped out, the twisted wheels showing howthey had tried conclusions with flinty boulders, or collided with one orother of the numberless mallee stumps protruding above the ground.On one occasion Tom gave a warning shout, and I saw his horse take aflying leap over a struggling cyclist who had got mixed up in the partsof his machine. I had just time to swerve my steed to avoid a calamity,and then we crashed on again at a mad gallop, evading the bicycles asbest we could, and sometimes clearing those which had come to grief at abound. It was in truth a wild and desperate race.When the last of the cyclists had been left behind, and the swaying,dust-enshrouded buggies and one or two solitary horsemen were still infront, Tom turned again."Let her go now, bhoys," he said, "there's a clear field ahead. Whoopla! Tally ho!"For the remainder of that gallop I had little time to view mysurroundings; I dug my heels into "Reprieve's" flanks, and he stretchedout his long neck and shot forward like an arrow from the bow. Buggiesand miscellaneous vehicles were overtaken and left in the rear. Varioushorsemen would sometimes range alongside for a trial of speed, but"Reprieve" outdistanced them all."It's Doyle's 'Reprieve,'" one of the disgusted riders cried; "an'there's 'Satan,' an', fire an' brimstone! here's Doyle hissel'."Tom's weight was beginning to tell on his noble animal, which had giventhe lead to my horse who carried the lightest load; but with scarcely adozen lengths between us we thundered past the foremost racing buggy,and were quickly dashing down towards Lake Gwinne, whose sands nowshimmered in the near distance. We were first in the rush after all.Suddenly we came upon a recently-excavated shaft with a dismantledwindlass lying near, and with one accord we drew up and dismounted."If this is where the Sacred Nugget came out of, it looks d----d badthat no one is about," growled Tom, throwing the reins of his horse overa mulga sapling and looking around doubtfully. It was clearly thevicinity indicated by Father Long, and we lost no time in marking offour lots in the direction we considered most promising. We had barelytaken these preliminary precautions when horsemen and buggies began toarrive in mixed order, and in a short time the ground all the way downto the lake was swarming with excited goldseekers."I'm blest if I like the look o' things at all, at all," mused Tom, andI was inclined to take a similar view of matters, for a morebarren-looking stretch of country would have been hard to find. Then,again, by examining the strata exposed in the abandoned shaft we couldform a fair estimate of the nature of the supposed gold-bearingformation; and after Phil and I had made a minute survey of allindications shown, we came to the conclusion that our ground, acquiredafter such a hard ride, was practically worthless and not likely torepay even the labour of sinking in it.The hundreds of others who had pegged out beyond us were not so quicklyconvinced, and they announced their intention of sinking to bedrock ifthey "busted" in the attempt. About an hour after our arrival at theSacred Nugget Patch, Phil and I started back for the Five-Mile Flat,satisfied to have taken part in so strange a rush, yet quite certainthat the Sacred Nugget had been unearthed in some other district, orthat the entire concern had been a stupendous hoax. Tom Doyle decided tocamp on the so-called "Patch" all night, without any special reason fordoing so beyond holding the ground in case some fool might want to buyit for flotation purposes, as had been done often before with uselessproperties.When we reached home that evening we were tired indeed, and in spite ofourselves we felt rather disappointed at the unsuccessful issue of themuch-advertised stampede."Ye've had a gran' time," said Mac regretfully, when Phil told of how heand "Satan" came in first after a most desperate race."I'm glad I didn't go with you," said Bill. "I hope I can resisttemptation in the way o' rushes until I is ready to sail back homeward.""It would certainly be better," I allowed, "than to give up a provedproperty for a miserable sham."As it happened, the famous rush had indeed proved but a worthlessdemonstration. Not a grain of gold was discovered near the Sacred Patch;and after much labour had been expended there, the disgusted minersabandoned their shafts in a body.[Illustration: A BREAKDOWN IN THE RUSH.]The mystery connected with the alleged nugget was never explained. Everybank in the Colony denied having seen it, and its supposed finders didnot again appear on the fields. Father Long must have been cruellyvictimised, of that there was no doubt, for no one could for a momentbelieve that he had perjured himself. He was justly known as athoroughly honourable man and a conscientious teacher. Even the mostsuspicious mind could not accuse him in any way. And he, the unfortunatedupe of a pair of unscrupulous rogues, did not long survive the severeshock given to an already feeble system. He died some months later, andwith him went the secret, if any, of the Great Sacred Nugget.INTO THE "NEVER NEVER" LANDA few weeks after the Sacred Nugget rush had taken place we lowered ourflag at the Five-Mile Flat, having come to an end of the auriferousworkings within our boundaries. I had meanwhile succeeded in purchasingfrom an Afghan trader two powerful camels and five horses, with theintention of using them on our projected inland expedition. The horses,I feared, would prove of little service, but for the early part of thejourney they might relieve the camels somewhat by carrying the varioustinned foodstuffs necessary for a long sojourn in the desert. These"various" stores vary but little notwithstanding their distinguishinglabels, and the bushman's vocabulary, always expressive, contains forthem a general title, namely, "tinned dog."Tinned dog and flour are, indeed, the sum total of the Australianexplorer's needs. The traveller in the great "Never Never" land is notan epicure by any means, and should he be burdened by over-æsthetictastes they quickly vanish when "snake sausage" or "bardie pie" hasappeared on his _menu_ for some days!Phil had decided to accompany us, and as he had shared our fortunessince our entry into the country, I was by no means loath to accept ofhis services, knowing him to be a highly trustworthy comrade, and aninvaluable addition to our little party he proved.It was hard to say goodbye to our old associates of the camp fire; Iknew they would not remain much longer at the same diggings, which wereshowing signs of playing out in almost every claim, and it was notlikely we should ever meet again.Old Tom was much affected; he had been our near neighbour so long, andunder the happiest circumstances of his wandering life, so he said, andnow we were going back into the "Never Never" country, and would neversee him more. I was not quite certain whether Old Tom meant that weshould most probably leave our bones in the central deserts, or whetherhis words were due to an extreme sentimentalism on his part, but Ipreferred to believe the latter."We'll call and see you at Adelaide some of these times, Tom," I said,while Stewart and Mac were bidding him an affectionate farewell, but heonly shook his head mournfully, and would not be comforted.As for Emu Bill, he had considerable faith in our enterprise, and would,I believe, have come with us had I said the word. He was, however, atrue specimen of the independent bushman, and unwilling to demonstratehis wishes."Durn it all, boys," said he with vigour, "I is not an old man yet, an'tho' I knows you aire a big enuff party without me to get through themallee country, I guess I'll coast it round to Derby in time to jine youin a Leopolds trip.""I thought you were going home after this rise, Bill," I saidquizzically, not surprised to find his early resolutions wavering."I'll mebbe see you 'cross the Leopolds first," he replied gravely. "Icalc'late I knows that bit o' kintry better'n any white man.""Goodbye, boys," roared Nuggety Dick and his satellites, waving theirshovels from their distant claims, and the echoes were taken up fromend to end of the lead, for where I was wholly unknown Mac and Stewarthad endeared themselves by devices peculiar to that crafty pair. It waspleasant to receive such a genial send-off, and though I am not as arule affected by farewell greetings, yet on this occasion I feltstrangely moved. The camels and horses stood ready, laden with the greatwater-bags and unwieldy mining machinery, and Phil was stroking the maneof one of the horses in listless fashion."It's a fairly long trip for you to start on, Phil," I said, noting thefar-away expression on his usually bright face."I was thinking of _other_ things," he answered quietly."Gee up, Misery!" cried Mac, cracking his long whip."Gee up, Slavery!" echoed Stewart. And we started out, heading N.N.E.,bound for the land where the pelican builds its nest.For the first few miles we crossed the gridiron-like tracks connectingthe numerous camps and settlements lying out from the main township ofKalgoorlie; but soon these signs of civilisation vanished, and in theearly afternoon our course lay over a wildering scrubland, withiron-shot sand-patches here and there among the stunted shrubs. Thecamels, which we had named "Slavery" and "Misery," led the trail. Theywere, indeed, wiry animals, and as I paced beside them, noting theiralmost ludicrously leisurely tread, I could not help remarking on thevast amount of latent power indicated in every movement of theirrubber-like bodies. "Slavery" was a patient and gentle animal, andmarched along meekly under his load of full seven hundred pounds, but"Misery" soon displayed a somewhat fiery temper, and before our firstday's journey was completed we were compelled to adopt stern measureswith the recalcitrant brute.The horses formed a sad-looking line behind the sturdier beasts ofburden, and they would cheerfully have forced along at a speedier ratethan the progress of the camels allowed. Among them were twohigh-spirited animals, which we named "Sir John" and "Reprieve," whilethe three others we dubbed simply "Sin," "Sand," and "Sorrow."We camped that evening just twelve miles from our starting-point, andyet it seemed as if we were already beyond the reach of civilisation.Not a trace of a white man's presence was visible anywhere, and for thefirst night we missed the crashing rattle of the ever-working batteries.A deathlike stillness filled the air, broken only by the startled screamof the carrion crow or the weird double note of the mopoke."There's any amount of room for prospecting here," hazarded Phil, gazingaround, after the horses and camels had been safely picketed. Which wastrue; yet who could have the heart to sink a proving shaft amid suchinhospitable surroundings?"If we locate an outcrop, boys," I said, "we may trace it up, butotherwise we can only test the surface sands with the dryblower."It was but vaguely known what kind of country lay far to eastward of us.Many thousands of square miles had never been crossed by any traveller,and strange rumours were often circulated among the miners of thevarious outposts regarding the extraordinary riches of the vast "NeverNever" land. It was even predicted that a great inland river flowednorthwards towards the Gulf of Carpentaria; how far it flowed beforesinking in the arid sands was a matter for conjecture, but it wasconfidently supposed to drain fertile valleys, and to be flanked bynoble mountain ranges rich in gold and precious gems. It was a rosyenough picture, surely, but one which, unfortunately, no explorer hadyet succeeded in bearing out."It's a gran' thing," said Mac thoughtfully, when supper was over, andwe were reclining on our blankets gazing at the stars, and listening tothe tinkling of the camel bells. "It's a vera gran' thing," he repeated,"tae be alane aince mair, an' wi' the bonnie stars shinin' brichtlyabune----""Here's a centipede!" roared Stewart, interrupting his comrade'smoralising."Then pit it in yer pocket, ma man," was the calm reply; and he resumedwhere he had left off: "Ay, it's a gran' thing, Phil, tae ken that ye'retraivellin' in new country, breathin' the bonnie pure air. Noo if ye hadbeen wi' me an' Stewart oot in Alaskie----""Spin me a yarn, Mac," said Phil, drawing his blanket closer, whileStewart started up in sheer amazement.Mac was visibly affected; he took his pipe from his mouth and gazed atthe camp fire blankly for some time without speaking. "Ye're a guid an'thochtfu' man, Phil," he said at length with great earnestness, "an'A'll gie ye a rale bonnie story...."I will pass but briefly over the early days of our march. Our track atfirst led through the Murchison district, for I wished to make amid-northerly latitude before steering east; but after leaving theGascoyne Channel the country traversed was of the most dreary nature,and similar to that around the more desolate southern gold camps.Several soaks were found opportunely when the water-bags were becomingdangerously flat, and our progress continued uneventfully for over aweek, but then the formation of the land-surface began to change rapidlyfor the worse. The dwarfed eucalypti became sparser and sparser, and intheir room appeared bushy clumps of saltbush and tufts of spiky spinifexgrass. The hard ironsand soil, too, gave place to a white yieldinggravel which hindered our advance greatly. The camels, certainly, werenot seriously inconvenienced, but the staggering horses sank over thefetlocks at each step, and stumbled forward painfully, while wefloundered alongside, almost blinded by the rising iron dust whichfilled our ears and nostrils.[Illustration: OUR LAST VIEW OF THE FIVE-MILE WORKING.]For two days we crossed this disheartening waste, fearing greatly forthe safety of the horses, which showed signs of collapse. No water hadbeen located for three days before entering upon this miserable tract,and assuredly none promised on its parched expanse. The horses--pooranimals!--fared rather ill in consequence, for we dared not give themmuch of our rapidly-diminishing fluid supply. On the morning of thethird day, however, our course led across slightly-improved country, sothat better progress was made, and our chances of finding water weredecidedly more encouraging.At noon we entered a belt of scrub, and soon were crashing through aminiature forest of stunted mallee; but this state of affairs was notdestined to last, for we could see in the distance, at a slightly higheraltitude, the open plain extending back into the horizon. At this pointPhil considered the indications very favourable for water, and wedecided to make a temporary camp, and search the district thoroughlybefore proceeding. We were preparing to unload the camels, when Stewart,who had gone a little way ahead, came rushing back in great excitement."Niggers!" he hoarsely whispered. Looking up I saw quite an assembly ofstalwart bucks directly in our course, and scarcely two hundred yards infront. Some bushes partially hid them from our view, and they hadevidently not yet observed us. They were well equipped with spears andwaddies; probably they were out on a hunting expedition, and, if so, itboded well for the resources of the district.While we hesitated, debating on our best plan of action, they saw us,and gave vent to a series of shrill yells, yet were apparently undecidedwhether to resent our presence or escape while they might. Then a showerof spears whizzed through the air, but fell short, and buried theirheads in the sand at our feet. We were just out of range of thesemissiles, luckily enough. My companions were not disposed to toleratesuch tactics, and Mac discharged his gun, loaded with small shot, at thehostile band. They waited no longer, but made a wild rush into thedensest part of the scrub, and were quickly lost to sight. Then weproceeded onwards warily, whilst far in the distance the branchescrackled and broke before the fleeing horde. The scene of their standwas littered with fragments of brushwood, and the dying embers of a firesmouldered in the centre of a small clearing close by. All around,shields, spears, and boomerangs lay scattered as they had been thrownwhen their owners took to flight. The sight was curiously strange andimpressive.My usually loquacious companions had been wonderfully silent during thelast day or so, owing, perhaps, to the uninspiring nature of ourenvironment, but now Mac succeeded in launching into a lengthy diatribe,in which he consigned the blacks generally to a very warm climateindeed."At the same time," said he, "we shidna forget that such inceedentsserve a vera usefu' purpose.""They seemed rale dacent black buddies," reflectively murmured Stewart."And they entertained the laudable desire of puncturing us with 'raledacent' spears," Phil added shortly.The camels stood patiently within the clearing, with their long necksoutstretched, and their heads moving up and down with the regularity ofautomatons; the horses straggled behind, gasping feebly."We'd better make a halt right here, boys," I said; "the horses seemplayed out completely." So while Mac and Stewart were engaged in thework of unloading them, Phil and I made a minute survey of oursurroundings. A huge breakwind guarded the circular space, and behind ita well-padded track led backwards into a richly-foliaged dell. Creepingplants and luxurious ferns grew in profession around the base of asingle lime-tree which found root in the hollow, and a long wiry kind ofgrass flourished abundantly under its genial shade."I'll investigate the cause of such unusual vegetation," Phil said,stepping forward."Look out for snakes," I warned; then turned to assist Mac in raisingpoor "Sorrow," who had rolled over on the ground, pack-saddle and all."The puir beastie's feenished," Mac said sorrowfully, "an' nae wunner.""Here's anither ane," wailed Stewart, and I looked up to see him wildlyendeavouring to keep "Sin" from falling on the top of sundry cookingutensils. It was plain that two at least of the horses could go nofurther if fortune did not speedily favour us."This is the deevil's ain countrie," groaned Mac helplessly, and for themoment I felt utterly disheartened as I watched the poor animalsconvulsively gasping on the sand.A shout from Phil drew my attention. "There's a spring here, boys," hecried gleefully from the lime-tree hollow.It was a welcome discovery; I had almost despaired of finding water inthe vicinity. "We'll camp for the day," I said, "and give our pack traina much-needed rest."The spring was a small one and beautifully clear; its waters gurgledgently through a fissure in a white kaolin formation, and the surplusflow was absorbed by the spreading roots of the climbing growthsmentioned. It was half hidden by an outjutting boulder, and furthercunningly screened from view by a heavy clump of overhanging grass.Evidently the blacks were in the habit of camping here frequently; thebreakwind might have been erected for one night's shelter, but the tracktowards the well had been long in use."I hope our landlords do not visit us to-night," Phil remarked, as wegazed at each other through the smoke of our camp fire some little timelater."It wud be a vera onfort'nate happenin'," Mac grunted placidly, drawinghis gun closer."They're mebbe cannibals," suggested Stewart uneasily."We'll keep a watch in case of accident," I said; "but I don't expectthey'll give us any trouble."But Stewart was still uneasy. "Their spears ha' an ex-tra-or'-nar'bluid-thirsty look," he grumbled again, examining the double-barbedweapons he had collected, "an' I hae nae faith whitever in theyblack-skinned heathen."However, the night passed without alarm, though we kept a careful watchand were ready for an attack should any have been attempted.We continued our march next morning, and in less than half an hour hademerged into open country, but now the surface soil was of a hard,gravelly nature, liberally strewn with the iron pebbles so abundant inmore southerly latitudes. Straggling growths of mallee and mulga spreadeverywhere, and at their roots reptiles and numberless nameless pestsseemed to abide. Black snakes writhed across our path, centipedessquirmed over our boots, iguanas in myriads started before ourapproach, and flying creatures with hard, scaly wings rose from theshadeless branches and dashed into our faces. Flies in dense cloudsassailed us, causing indescribable torture, and the diminutive sandinsect was also extremely active, seeking into our socks and raggedclothing despite our most stringent precautions.For over a week we journeyed across this dreary wilderness, nor did weonce observe a break in the horizon's even curve; the weather,meanwhile, being of sweltering description. Then a dim haze towards thenorth-east gradually outlined into a well-defined mountain range as weadvanced, and the country in general took on a more irregularappearance. We were now nearing the line of the explorer Wells'snorthward march, and I altered our course slightly in order to intersectit at a point where a good water supply was charted, for four days hadelapsed since we had last discovered any trace of moisture.All that day we forced onwards wearily, the sun beating down upon usmercilessly the while. No more desolate tract could be imagined thanthat which lies in these latitudes: the motionless mallee and mulgashrubs, the glistening beady surface over which we dragged our feet, thequivering heat haze that so distorted our vision, and the solemnstillness--the awful stillness of a tomb--all tended to overwhelm themind. A broken range of sandstone hills loomed clearly out of the hazeearly in the afternoon, directly in our track, and I again shifted thecourse so as to round their southern extremity. Towards the south thesand wastes extended far as the eye could reach, but east and north manymouldering peaks now interrupted our view.We found the spring without difficulty; it contained about forty gallonsof muddy water, over which a thick green scum had gathered, and it wassimply moving with animal life. Many bones of doubtful origin layheaped near to it; some were probably the remains of kangaroos killed bythe natives, of whom there were numerous signs in the neighbourhood, butPhil insisted that not a few human bones were among the bleaching mass.At the bottom of the spring the complete vertebræ of several snakes andsimilar reptiles almost wholly covered the chalky, impervious base, buthow these came to be there was a matter beyond my comprehension."Most probably," said Phil, "the natives like a snaky flavour in thewater.""It mak's it extra paleetable tae them, nae doot," groaned Mac with ashudder, "but I hae nae parshiality fur crawly bastes, even when they'redeid."Stewart had by this time acquired a philosophical turn of mind. "What'sthe guid o' growlin', Mac?" he snorted. "There's mebbe waur than thattae come yet."That we were in a district favoured by the blacks was very certain,although we had not yet observed any of the dusky savages; three or fourbreakwinds sheltered a space close to the spring, and the ground wasblack with burnt-out smokes and charred logs. The water, notwithstandingits pronounced medicinal flavour, was a great improvement on the fetidsolutions of the various soaks we had encountered, and we decided tocamp by it for several days, so as to test the auriferous resources ofthe surface sands, which looked rather promising, and also to give ustime to make some much-needed repairs in our tattered wardrobe.The results of our experiments with the supposed auriferous countryproved too insignificant for more than a passing mention here. A fewcolours were obtained, but nothing to give confidence to even the mostunambitious goldseeker. Rather disconsolately we prepared to resume ourmarch in a more N.E. direction, and three days later we started on ouraltered course. The eternal sameness of things in the Australianinterior makes daily records of progress unentertaining reading, andthough each day's travel comes back to my mind now as I write withpainful vividness, yet it but cries out in the same strain as itspredecessor and follower, "Sand, sand, everlasting sand."For many miserable days and weeks we struggled eastward, sometimesdeviating to the north or south in vain endeavour to escape unusuallydeterrent belts of the frightful wastes now so familiar to us all.Sometimes we would locate a soak or claypan when least expecting such afind, and again, we might be reduced to almost certain disaster beforethe water-bags were replenished at some providential mudhole in ourcourse. I do not wish to enlarge upon the miseries of our journeyings;we took these willingly on ourselves at the start, hoping for acompensating reward in the shape of valuable knowledge; and is notexperience always priceless? Knowledge we did gain, it is true, but notof the kind we had over-fondly anticipated; still, we had not yetreached the planned limit of our expedition, and who knew what mightawait us in the dim, shadowy mountain that stretched its cumberingheight far on the eastern horizon?We had sighted this landmark nearly a week before, but having been morethan usually zealous in our search for the precious metal among theoutcropping iron formations now frequently encountered, our rate oftravel had been reduced to a few miles each day. Two of the horses werestill left us; the last of the ill-fated three had succumbed from sheerexhaustion nearly fifty miles back, but "Sir John" and "Reprieve,"though no longer the high-spirited animals they once were, still carriedtheir jolting burdens of tinned meats, flour, and extracts, thoughtheir steps were daily becoming weaker, and their bright eyes cloudingin a manner that foretold the worst. The camels stubbornly paced ahead,with the great water-bags tantalisingly lapping their tough hides, andthe miscellaneous mining implements perched on their hollow backs; theyhad already served us well and nobly, and I devoutly hoped their vastenergies would bear them over the worst that lay before us.[Illustration: TAKING OUR POSITION.]EL DORADO!We were now close on the 125th degree of longitude, which I had markedas the limit of our eastward course, and my faith in more northerlylatitudes was so little, indeed, that I dreaded making any change in ourdirection of travel."If we don't strike gold within the next couple of days," said Phil,"there isn't much likelihood of our being overburdened with wealth atthe end of the trip."Mac, who was pulling the nose rope of the leading camel, at once liftedup his voice in protest."For Heaven's sake be mair pleasant wi' yer remarks, Phil," he cried. "Iwas calculatin' on goin' home like a young millionaire----""You'll need to calculate again, then, Mac," interrupted Phil, "for Idon't think we'll get a red cent out of the ground on this journey."But the complainer was not yet satisfied."What's the guid o' bein' a golologist?" he demanded wrathfully. "Ithocht----"What he thought remained unspoken, for at that moment we heard ascramble behind, and looking round we saw the doughty Mac and hiscompatriot Stewart engaged in fierce conflict."I saw it first, ye red-heided baboon," roared the former, withremarkable fluency of expression."The fact o' seeing it is naething--naething at a'," returned the otherwith great complacency, "It's sufficient to say that I hae got it."The camels, feeling the strain of guidance relaxed, had come to a halt,and were now seemingly taking an interest in the squabble. It was a rarething for them to be left to their own devices, even for a moment. Timeis precious when crossing these vast salt tracts, and midday stoppagesin the blazing sun are dangerous."What are you two quarrelling about now?" I asked sternly, feeling in nogentle mood with the hinderers. Mac's face assumed an intenselyaggrieved expression, but he held his peace, and Stewart calmlydisplayed a small rounded pebble between his finger and thumb,announcing blandly that it alone was the cause of the disturbance."It's a bonnie stane," said he, gazing at his treasure admiringly."An' it's mine by richt," howled Mac.I was about to lecture the pair strongly on their foolish behaviour overwhat I supposed to be an ordinary fragment of white quartz, when Philuttered an exclamation, and, rushing back, snatched the pebble fromStewart's hand and proceeded to examine it closely. So eager was hisscrutiny that in a moment we were clustered round him, awaiting hisverdict with extreme interest."What do you make of it?" said he at length, handing the stone to me."Weather-worn quartz," I replied promptly. He shook his head."We'll work it out in specific gravity later," he said, with the air ofone who was sure of his ground; "but I will bet you this half of a shirtI am wearing that it's a genuine ruby, and there must be more of them inthe vicinity.""Hurroo!" yelled Mac and Stewart in unison, prancing around delightedly,and for the moment Phil's delinquencies were forgotten in the tribute ofpraise that my worthy henchmen generously accorded the "golologist."They ended by making him a present of the fateful gem, though Macsomewhat spoilt the effect of the gift by soliloquising rather loudly--"It'll be well to propeetiate the golologist, Stewart, my man, for he'snae sae stupid as he looks, efter a'."Soon after we renewed our march, much uplifted at the thought ofacquiring treasure even more valuable than gold; but though we kept asharp look-out on the ground surface, the early afternoon passed withoutany further coloured pebbles being discovered, whereat Mac againcommenced to revile the country with his customary eloquence."That ruby wis a delooshun," he asserted stoutly. "Some o' the El Doradofairies must ha'e put it there on purpose to deceive us, an' noo they'llbe having grand fun at oor expense.""Hustle along old Misery, and don't moralise," I interjected hastily."Moralise?" he echoed. "Me moralise? No vera likely. I never dae such athing. Gee up, Meesery, an' stop winkin' at me this meenit."But the mention of El Dorado had aroused in Stewart a strain ofrecollection, and as he paced beside his cumbrous charge he made severalineffectual attempts to recite some ancient verses as learned in thedays of his youth."I canna mind the poetry o' it," he broke out at last, "but the storywas real bonnie; it telt hoo a warrior went out to seek for El Dorado,and--and----" Then his memory came back to him, and he chanted outdismally--      "And as his strength      Failed him at length,    He met a pilgrim shadow.      'Shadow,' said he,      'Where can it be,    This land of El Dorado?'      'Over the mountains      Of the moon,    Down the valley of the Shadow,      Ride, boldly ride,'      The Shade replied,    'If you seek for El Dorado.'""Which is," grunted Mac, "which is, metaphorically speaking, preceeselywhat we are doing. Gee up, Meesery, and dinna look sae weary-like.""Our specimen must have been shed from that mountain," I repeated, whenwe lay down in our blankets at night.The morning dawned clear and beautifully calm. The sky was cloudless,save where in the east a billowy sea of gold marked where the sun hadrisen. The leafless branches of the mulga shrubs growing near quiveredin the rising rays, and the long sand-track ahead sparkled as the watersof a gilded ocean. But now, through the dispelling haze the firm outlineof a precipitous mountain became clearly visible only a few miles ahead.In our eager search on the preceding afternoon we had not observed thenearness of the welcome sentinel, or probably it was that the darkeningsky in the early evening had shut it from our view. There was certainlyno doubt about its presence now, and we hailed it right gladly as wewatched it loom out of the dissolving mists."It's mebbe a mirage," suggested Stewart apprehensively."Nary miradge," retorted Mac; "it's El Dorado, that's what it is. Justwhat we were looking for."Five minutes later I was ogling the sun with my sextant, while Philstood by with the trusty chronometer in his hand to note the time of myobservations."125 degrees 17 minutes east longitude," he announced, after a roughcalculation, "which makes the mountain about ten miles off."      "'Shadow,' said he,      'Whaur can it be,    This land o' El Dorado?'"Stewart trolled out lustily as he set about the preparation of themorning meal. About eight o'clock we were ready to start, which showedunusual alacrity in our movements. The camels, too, seemed imbued withfresh life, and allowed themselves to be loaded without their customaryprotests."I've never seen Meesery sae tractable," Mac said in amazement, pattingthe trembling nostrils of the leading camel. "I wonder what's gaun tohappen?""We're all ready," sung out Phil blithely, and I gave the usual signalfor the advance."Gee up, Meesery," grunted Mac."Aince mair, Slavery," implored Stewart, and we set out for the mountainat an unusually lively pace. The forenoon passed without event, and sospeedy had been our progress that our midday halt was made amongst thestraggling timber belt which feathered the base of the mountain. We lostno time in making ready for the ascent, and within an hour after ourarrival we had hobbled the camels and were starting out on our journeyof discovery.For the first half-hour we made fairly good headway through thestraggling belt of eucalypti covering the lower slopes, then we emergedon a treeless, boulder-strewn expanse, on which the sun scintillatedwith burning intensity. Over this scorched area we clambered as best wecould. The sharp rubble cut through our boots, and the glistening rocks,hot as a fiery furnace, burnt our clutching hands. Our mountainexploration was surely becoming less of a picnic than we hadanticipated. Directly above, a solid mass of basalt reared its head,gaunt and bare, but when we came to the edge of the glass-like cap, wehesitated--we might as well have attempted to cross a field of moltenmetal. From this point various dry channels tore down the face of thehill, radiating outwards into the plain. They were so silted up withrock fragments and ironsand as to be scarcely perceptible, but Phil'strained eye at once noted their significance."Ages ago," said he, "those gullies were filled with rushing torrents,which goes to prove that a crater lake existed on the top of themountain."He walked over to one of the ancient beds and scraped among the drift ofblack sand conglomeration. At once several water-worn specimens ofquartzite were uncovered, and of these over fifty per cent bore thecharacteristic markings of the ruby."Fill your pockets with these, Mac," he said quietly. "They should beworth considerably more than their weight in gold."Prolonged travelling in Western Australia does not tend to developenthusiasm, and the extraordinary find so unexpectedly made was greetedby no extravagant manifestations of delight. Relief rather than joy wasours at that moment, for in one important sense at least our questseemed surely ended."If we can find water in the vicinity we'll camp at the foot of the hillfor a few days, boys," I announced with much satisfaction. "Meanwhile wehad better explore a little further, and see what the country looks likefrom the summit."[Illustration: A NATIVE CAMP.]But Mac and Stewart were already busily engaged collecting specimens,which they stowed in every nook and corner of their ragged garments."Come along, you gloating misers!" cried Phil, as he and I started tonegotiate the last stiff climb."There's nae time like the present," growled Mac oracularly, pursuinghis congenial task with supreme content."I'm o' the same opeenion," spluttered Stewart, who had turned his mouthinto a receptacle for the finest gems in his collection. So we crawledover the smooth climaxing dome alone. Our surprise was great when onreaching the top we found ourselves on the edge of a small circular areathat depressed ever so slightly towards the centre, providing a spacewhich looked remarkably like an ordinary circus ring. This impressionwas much heightened by the fact that a well-marked path seemed to havebeen worn around the periphery; but through what agency this had beendone I could not well imagine. We stood surveying the odd arena, filledwith wonder."It is one of Nature's strange tricks," I said, after a considerablesilence.Phil looked doubtful, but he did not speak. Then we made a furtherdiscovery. The saucer-shaped hollow was graven out of a solid lavaformation, but exactly over the point of its deepest dip severalcrumbling branches lay strewn. Of a certainty they had not come there oftheir own accord, and at once we were overwhelmed with dire misgivings."It means that there are some native tribes in the neighbourhood," saidPhil, watching me kick aside the branches with much interest. What wesaw then did not add to our bewilderment, for we had already partlyguessed the significance of the peculiar arrangement. Under the layer ofbrush, a narrow, funnel-like shaft had been hid, which apparentlydescended into the heart of the mouldering desert sentinel, but why thishole had been covered was more than we could understand. While we stoodin silent contemplation of the remarkable state of affairs disclosed,our energetic companions, having marvelled at our long absence, swarmedup beside us, breathing heavily."Nebuchadnezzar's furnace wouldna be in the same street wi' that biler,"began Mac, patting his scantily-covered knees with tender solicitude."I smell nigger," howled Stewart, taking in the scene at a glance."That's aye what happens when A come oot withoot my gun," sorrowfullymuttered the first arrival, moving over to the narrow crater mouth andpeering into the darkness with studied nonchalance.It so happened, however, that the loose pockets of his flimsy uppergarment were filled to overflowing with cherished specimens, and thehalf-kneeling attitude which he assumed allowed them to escape in acopious stream, so that they fell down into the depths. With a bellow ofrage he drew back, but not before the bulk of his treasure haddisappeared; then the air was filled with the fulness of his wrath, andsulphurous expressions loud and deep were hurled into the Stygian gloom."Calm yersel', Mac--calm yersel'," adjured Stewart soothingly."Calm be d----d!" roared the afflicted one. "Hoo am I goin' to get backmy rubies?"This was a point which seemed unanswerable."You'll get more to-morrow, Mac," I said, "but we'll have to return tothe camels now, in case the natives get a hold of them before we havetime to take precautions."He remained unappeased, however."We'll mebbe hae to flee for oor lives afore morning," he protestedgloomily. "It's no the first time we've had to strike camp in a hurry."As he spoke he unwound from his waist a long coil of rope which heusually carried in case of emergency, and, with dogged determination,proceeded to sound the depths of the well."You'd better let me gang," advised Stewart, guessing his companion'sintentions before they had been uttered; "I'm no sae bulky as you,an'----"He got no further."Mak' nae mair allooshuns," came the answer, with a chilling dignity."I'll engineer this funeral mysel'."Hastily fastening a fragment of rock to the end of the rope, he droppedit into the narrow orifice and carefully noted the length of line runout. All this time Phil and I had made little comment, never expectingthat any satisfactory bottom would be found; but great was our surpriseto see the rope become stationary when little over twenty feet had beenpaid out."I'm really anxious to know what is at the bottom of that hole, Mac,"said Phil; "but I hope you don't find a nice fat, healthy crocodileawaiting you----""Haud the end o' the rope, Phil, an' dinna speechify," broke out theharassed Mac impatiently; and he wriggled his somewhat substantial forminto the vertical channel until his arms alone saved him from fallingdown altogether."It's a--a tight fit," he grumbled, with diminishing enthusiasm. "Noohaud on tight, ye deevils; haud on--haud on!"His voice rumbled up dolorously to our ears as we lowered him gentlyinto the mysterious pit, until, when the lower depths were reached, therocky vault seemed to tremble with vague echoes. Suddenly the strain onthe rope was relaxed, and we waited expectantly for tidings from theadventurer."It's vera dark doon here," came the ghost-like voice from theunderground. "I think--I think I'll come up----""What sort of bottom have you got, Mac?" I shouted. "Try and fetch up aspecimen."A few more inconsequent remarks issued from the pit mouth, then we couldsee the dull glimmer of a match far below. Almost immediately after ajubilant yell of triumph swelled up to the surface."I've got them! I've got them!" he cried. "An' there's gold quartz here,foreby." Then came a crash, a rumble, and a dull, heavy splash, and weon the surface gazed on each other in dismay."Let me doon! Let me doon!" wailed Stewart. "Something serious hashappened to Mac. Haud on to the rope." He let himself into the narrowaperture with unwonted agility, and, with an unspeakable fear in ourhearts, Phil and I commenced to pay out the rope."Wha the--who the----Wha's blockin' the licht?" bellowed awell-known voice from the bowels of the earth, which had the effect ofejecting Stewart into the outer air with a celerity astonishing tobehold. Then we breathed again.Apparently some ledge had first intercepted our sounding-line, and alsoprovided a precarious foothold for our valiant associate; but that thetrue bottom had now been reached there was little room for doubt."I might have guessed before," said Phil, "that the crater would have animpervious base, and so retain any rain that might be collected."Judging by the snorts and puffs emitted by the individual who was in aposition to know, the shaft must have held a fair amount of liquidcontents."Haul on the rope, for heaven's sake!" spluttered he. "This water wouldpushion a nigger. Haul me up quick! There's snakes an' wee crocodilestickling me!"In haste we endeavoured to obey his beseeching call, but the sodden cordwas not equal to the strain, and twice the strands snapped before ourcomrade's bulk was raised from the water."We'd better double the line, boys," I said. "Mac must have increased inweight during his sojourn below."The unfortunate victim of his own prowess groaned lugubriously from hisdank and dark prison, but found time between his grumbling to curseright heartily the various denizens of his watery environment."Be patient, Mac, be patient," counselled Stewart, rearranging thehaulage system. "Scientific exploration is not without its drawbacks, asyou should well ken by this time." He continued addressing choice wordsof wisdom to his helpless compatriot while he deftly spliced the rope.During this lull in operations I chanced to look abroad over thesweltering plain, and at once my eyes detected the curling "smokes" of anative camp. We had been too busily engrossed with other matters sinceour arrival on the hill-top to observe the landscape on the east, andnow the nearness of a possible hostile band appalled me. Our rifles hadbeen left in camp, and I only carried a revolver."By Jove!" said Phil, "we are going to be in a fix." Then a shout ofalarm broke from him: "There's about a dozen of the ugliest bucks I eversaw coming right up the hill," he said feebly. I followed his gaze, and,sure enough, I could see a number of hideously-scarred andfeather-bedecked warriors making their way through the scraggybrushwood, scarcely a hundred yards from where we stood. With frantichaste, we again endeavoured to rescue our companion from his awkwardpredicament, but fate was surely against us. We had with our combinedefforts raised him only a few feet when the rope came in contact withthe broken ledge, and the strands parted like so many straws, so thatMac was once more precipitated back into the slimy waters. Our plans hadnow to be made quickly."Go down to the camp, Stewart," I said, "and fetch a camel pack-rope andmy rifle. Phil and I will make the best of things till you come back."Forgetful alike of the burning rock and the sharp-edged rubble, he sliddown the smooth declivity, and made a wild burst for the foot of thehill. Almost immediately the many-barbed spears of the aborigines boreinto view from the opposite side of the dome, and we laid ourselves flaton the curving wall and breathlessly waited events. Slowly a weirdprocession filed on to the elevated platform, and continued a solemnmarch around the well-trod channel which had first claimed ourattention. Round and round they circled, clashing their spears andshields, and swaying their lithe black bodies drunken-like. Thensuddenly they broke out into a dismal chant, and quickened their stepinto a half-run, ludicrous to behold. It was soon evident to us that thewarrior band had not come to level their spears against us; they neveronce glanced in our direction. Their gaze was apparently fixed on theancient crater in which Mac lay entombed. They had come to worship thegreat spirit Wangul, the dreaded "Dweller in the Waters."The _dénoûement_ of this interesting ceremonial was rapid andunexpected. Just when the reeling warriors had ceased their vocalexercise from sheer want of breath, when the ensuing silence was brokenonly by the pattering of many feet on the sun-baked lava, a hoarse voicethundered up from subterranean caverns, and at the sound the poornomads halted in their mad career, and gazed at each otherterror-stricken."Babba, Wangul, Moori!" they cried shrilly, "Babba, Wangul, Moori!"("The Water God speaks"). Again a sonorous echo reverberated up from theheart of the mountain, completing their demoralisation. A moment theyhesitated, then, dashing their warlike arms to the ground, and tearingthe feathers from their hair, they fled madly back whence they had come.Phil gave a gasp of relief, and I felt thankful beyond expression. Thenwe quickly made our way through the litter of discarded weapons towardsthe Wangul's home. The words that floated to our ears when we gazed intothe depths were sulphurous in the extreme. Poor Mac could not understandwhy he had been so ruthlessly neglected, and his complaints were deepand eloquent."Stewart, ye red-heided deevil, are ye goin' to pu' me oot, or are yeno?" he howled in righteous indignation, and I was glad that theindividual named, who just then came swarming over the rocks, puffingtempestuously, had not heard the fervent malediction bestowed upon hisfaithful person. He approached laden with the whole armoury of theexpedition, the perspiration streaming from his face, and his gauntframe trembling visibly."I thought ye had been all slauchtered," he muttered, subsiding behindhis equipment, "an' I wis goin' to hae revenge."With the aid of the stout camel-ropes we soon raised our drippingcomrade to the surface. As he approached the light of day I noticed thathis rugged old face bore a distinctly grim expression, as if he was ofthe opinion that we had been having a huge joke at his expense; but whenhe heard of what had occurred, and the part he had unwittingly playedin the ceremonial, resentment gave place to mirth, and he laugheduproariously."An' here's the rubies, Stewart, my man," he said, extracting theprecious stones from some secret corner of his bedraggled wardrobe; "Igot them safe efter a', and you shall have the finest are o' thecollection for yer maist splendifferous efforts on my behalf."Soon after we returned to camp, but it was many days later when we saidgoodbye to the lonely mountain which Mac persisted in misnaming ElDorado.[Illustration: EL DORADO!]WHERE THE PELICAN BUILDS ITS NESTThere is little need to recount the monotonous details of my log-bookfor the many weeks that ensued. The same description applies to nearlyall the vast interior country, and we struggled over ironshotsand-plains and through scraggy brushwood belts, with rarely a diversionin the landscape to gladden our weary eyes. The sun shines on no moredesolate or dreary country than this great "Never Never" land ofAustralia, whose grim deserts have claimed many a victim to the cause ofknowledge. The explorer's life amid the deadly solitudes is not one ofmany pleasures. Rather do unpleasant possibilities for ever obtrude uponhis jaded brain until he is well-nigh distraught, or at least reduced toa morbid state of melancholy in keeping with his miserable surroundings.Little wonder, therefore, that disaster so often attends the travellerin these lonely lands. The strongest will becomes weakened by theinsidious influences of the country, and the most buoyant spirit isquickly dulled. All Nature seems to conspire against him. The stuntedmallee and mulga shrubs afford no welcome shade; they dot thesand-wastes in endless even growths, and the eye is wearied by theireverlasting motionless presence. The saltbush clumps and spinifexpatches conceal hideous reptiles. Snakes and centipedes crawl acrossthe track; scaly lizards, venomous scorpions, ungainly bungarrows, and ahost of nameless pests, are always near to torture and distract. Eventhe birds are imbued with a solemnity profound that adds still more tothe plenteous cares that already overwhelm the wanderer in the silentbushland. The pelican stands owlishly in his path as if to guard fromintrusion its undiscovered home; the horrible carrion crow with itsdemoralising croak is for ever circling overhead; and the mopoke's dullmonotone is as a calling from a shadowy world.These various influences were not without their effect upon my littleparty, and we became strangely silent as we kept up our dogged march offifteen miles each day; and when danger threatened, as it did on morethan one occasion, we almost viewed our approaching fate withindifference, so sodden had our mental faculties become. Eleven daysafter leaving the mountain, our last horse, "Sir John," dropped quietlyto the ground, utterly exhausted, and at once the air was filled withscreaming crows, and flies in thousands began to settle on the dyinganimal's heaving flank, and crowded into his ears and nostrils. I endedthe poor brute's agony with a revolver shot, and again old "Slavery"received additional burden; then we hastened onwards, not daring to lookback.We were now many hundreds of miles from any outpost settlement, and withonly two camels between us and--eternity. Yet these ponderous animalsbore up bravely, seldom showing signs of weakness even when crossing themost dismally arid wastes, and their slow but sure movement raised ourdrooping spirits when our circling crow convoy became suggestivelydaring. I made a course due north, determined to intersect any promisingcountry that might intervene in the middle latitudes, but so far ourchanged route had led us full three hundred miles over the mostbarren-looking desert that could possibly be imagined.Only once did we observe natives, and that was when under the 23rdParallel, in a scrubby country offering the only inducement to the poornomads within a hundred miles. At this place we located a local wellcontaining, seemingly, an unlimited supply of lime-flavoured fluid; ourperilously-flat water-bags were thankfully refilled, and our hopes rosehigh at the unexpected find. But when we renewed our march thescrub-land soon merged into the blistering plain, and our dreams of acoming El Dorado were again rudely dashed.On one occasion we encountered a stretch of salt-crusted country,evidently the bed of an ancient lake: it extended for five miles in aN.N.E. direction, and towards its latter extremity the surface wasmarshy and damp. We extracted sufficient moisture from the muddy basinfor cooking our usual allowance of rice, so that we might save whatremained of our comparatively fresh supply for more urgent needs.Beyond this swamp we entered upon a more broken expanse than had met ourview for many weeks. Decaying sandstone rocks reared their heads abovethe gravel, and enormous dry gullies tore up the ground in alldirections. But this state of affairs did not continue with us long,and, as if by a grim law of compensation, a belt of the most miserablesand country soon intervened to retard our progress. Here the sand wasloose and deep, and unmixed with the usual iron gravel; and theslightest wind blew the fine dust into our faces, almost blinding us. Wesank over the ankles at each step, and the camels slowed their alreadyslow march to a mere crawl, and staggered and floundered in the wavymasses.Gradually the land-surface took on the appearance of a great sand-sea,with billows rolling back in a northwesterly direction. As far as theeye could reach, a series of gentle undulations rippled into the vastdistance. I altered the course several points to eastward, and wetraversed the disheartening obstacles at a difficult angle; but theundulations grew more general as we advanced, until they surrounded usin the form of seemingly endless furrows, about a hundred and fiftyyards apart, and from ten to fifteen feet in height. A sparse vegetationof spinifex found root in the hill-crests, giving the appearance--from adistance--of a huge cultivated and well-tended field. But on closeracquaintance the ridges showed up miserably bare and cheerless, andtheir white gleaming sand formation caused our eyes to quiver and close,so trying was the light reflected from them. No life of any kind wasobserved. Even the crows had abandoned us. We seemed to be traversingthe bed of an ocean whose waters had long since subsided. A day's marchover these hindering obstructions, however, led us into the familiarironshot and scrub country, which, desolate though it was, looked cooland inviting after our experience with the sand elevations.More than once after this fortune favoured us opportunely by the happylocation of a soak or claypan in our course, and we grew to trustProvidence in a much greater measure than we had ever anticipated. Theweather was almost unbearably hot; a vertical sun stared down on us inthe daytime with burning intensity, and at night the air was as thebreath of Hades. We were surely paying the penalty of the pioneer to thefull.By this time our clothing had reached a state far beyond repair, and wemust have formed an extraordinarily dilapidated-looking quartet. Ourgarments, not very lavish from the start, had been discarded intattered portions, and we were left with cool and scanty apparel, thesight of which would have caused the most abandoned tramp to turn asidein disgust. It came to be a subject of jocularity with us as we notedthe gradual disintegration of our meagre remaining sartorial glory; andI was glad even for such an excuse to introduce the lighter vein intoour conversation. "I'll shin be able tae flee," Mac would say, ruefullysurveying his rags. "Ay, Mac, the wings are sproutin' awfu' fast," hiscomrade would sorrowfully reply. "Bit it's a blessin' the weather's nocauld," he never failed to add, with philosophical gratitude.We were reaching an extreme northerly latitude, with the great centraldeserts behind us, and though we had been bitterly disappointed with thenon-auriferous country crossed, yet the thought of emerging safely fromthe "Never Never" land for the time took the place of vain regrets andcheered us on to fresh endeavour. We had found no El Dorado in theblistering salt plains; the Land of Promise had eluded us completely--ifsuch a land existed. Our time, it is true, had been more taken up insearching for water than prospecting for gold; still, we took occasionto analyse samples of every probable gold-bearing patch encountered, butalways with insignificant result.One morning we found ourselves in the unenviable position of having buta few pints of water left in the canvas bags, and as we had located nosoak for over a week, our immediate future seemed gloomy indeed. Thecamels were for the first time showing signs of collapse; and littlewonder; they had gone eight days without a drink, and their load, sincethe last of the horses had succumbed, had been unduly heavy."We've got to find water to-day, boys," I said, "or something serious isbound to happen."Mac chuckled dryly. "The deil aye tak's care o' his ain," he announcedwith an effort at pleasantry; and Stewart cackled harshly in agreement.Soon after breakfast, Phil, in surveying the landscape by the aid of hisfield-glasses--a very cherished possession--detected in the distance along, curling column of smoke, sure evidence of the aborigines'presence, and at once our hearts became lighter and our waning strengthrenewed. "There must be moisture of some sort about," I said to Phil, aswe staggered along together in the wake of the camels. "The country ischanging for the better," he replied, "yet I can scarcely imagine aspring to exist in any such soft sand formation." The vagaries of theinterior plains had always mystified him, but he could not be brought toreason against his geological principles.Mac's verdict was borne of a more practical kind of observation. "Furony sake haud yer tongue aboot furmashuns, Phil," he shouted back fromhis position by the side of "Slavery." "A black buddie needs a drink asweel as a white buddie, an' we'll shin be in the land o' Goschen noo.""There's one thing we had best remember, boys," I said. "The natives inthese latitudes are probably very different from those in the south.They may be cannibals, and considerably more hostile than any tribe wehave yet met.""Niggers!" snorted Mac and Stewart almost simultaneously, with anindescribable inflection of contempt. Further words failed them, but Icould see that they had completely forgotten the little episode at ElDorado.Towards noon we arrived at the point where the smoke had been seen, butonly a few charred logs were now in evidence, and they were scatteredabout in the sand as if they had been partially burnt long previously,and afterwards half submerged in the drifts caused by many seasons'willie-willies. The natives had vanished in some unaccountable manner,leaving not a trace of their recent presence in the vicinity. Far offnear the horizon a thick belt of timber stretched across our track, butbeyond that again the bare desert merged into the skyline."Whaur hae the black deevils gaun to?" Mac demanded indignantly, as if aconsiderable breach of etiquette had been committed by the rapid flightof our prospective hosts.Then Stewart proceeded to poke among the scattered ashes, and soondiscovered several still glowing logs well sunk beneath the surface."Mac," said he solemnly, when we clustered round to examine his find,"we'll hae tae ca' canny; the deevils are no defeecient in strategy, an'it's plain they dinna want oor guid company."Stewart was right; the blacks must have observed our approach, and beingunwilling to meet us, had hastily decamped, first taking care to coverup any clue that might have aroused our curiosity. "That field-glass ofyours has done good work, Phil," I said, when we turned away. "If youhad not noticed the smoke we should never have dreamed that there hadbeen any one here for at least a year, and goodness knows what mighthave happened if we had gone to sleep in this district without keeping awatch."Mac chirruped to his patient charge. "Gee up, Slavery," said he, "ye'llget a drink the nicht."In spite of our most strenuous efforts, however, we were unable to reachthe timber belt that day, and darkness closed over and compelled us tocamp while we were yet a good way out in the open. For the last severalmiles the camels had literally to be dragged over the ground by aconstant pressure on their nose ropes, and when we halted our wearycaravan and unloaded the suffering beasts, they sank upon their kneesbreathing heavily, and made no attempt to search for anything to eat. Itwas plain that, should another day pass without water being discovered,our four-footed companions must give up the struggle, which in turnwould mean that we should all be doomed to a most unenviable fate."Ma puir animile," said Mac, stroking "Slavery's" quivering nostrils,"ye've been nine days withoot a drink, but ye'll get a' ye can tak' themorn.""Slavery" seemed almost to understand the sympathetic words, and gruntedfeebly in reply; then I was surprised to see him struggle to his feetand proceed to feed on the spinifex tufts growing around."He kens I'm tellin' the truth!" shouted Mac delightedly; and there wasmuch joy among us when "Misery," determined not to be outdone, afterseveral efforts succeeded in rising shakily and joining his neighbour."There's life in auld 'Misery' yet," applauded Stewart with heartysatisfaction; and the wonderful endurance shown by the dumb animals mademe somewhat ashamed of my own collapsing resolution."Let's be happy, boys," counselled Phil in most lugubrious tones. "Lifeis short, you know, and we'll be a long time dead.""If I hear ony mair o' they on-comfortable re-marks," slowly spoke Mac,with a reproachful glance at the last speaker, "I'll sing ye the DeidMarch. A lang time deid, did ye say? For ony sake, Phil, think onsomething cheery.""All right, Mac," retorted Phil. "I'll think of the feast we're going tohave in the Hotel Cecil when we get back to civilisation." While hespoke he unconsciously hitched in his belt another hole.Then Stewart's voice rasped out dismally, "There's ... nae ... placelike ... hame----""Stop that concert!" I cried, while Phil squirmed in agony; but Mac hadalready seized the throat of the musician in a relentless grip, and themelancholy refrain spluttered out spasmodically to a finish."Ye on-ceevilised backslider!" Mac roared in righteous wrath. "Hoo daurye whine aboot hame in sic a menner? Fur twa peens," he concluded, withrising ferocity--"fur twa peens, ma man, A'd shak' yer teeth oot!"The half-choked culprit smiled with benign expression, "I wis makin' ajoyfu' noise," he replied calmly. "Ye're gettin' gey hard tae please,I'm thinkin'."Phil laughed till the tears sprang to his eyes and traced small channelsdown his unwashed face, but he stopped abruptly when Mac shoved a tinpannikin under his chin."What a sinfu' waste o' water," said the sphinx. "I raelly wunner at ye,Phil."Stewart, who had been busying himself about the fire, now interruptedagain. "Supper's ready," he howled, "an' the menoo is tinned dug an'damper, or damper an' tinned dug; wi' a puckle roasted rice fur them aswants indee-gestion; the hale tae be washed doon wi' twa or three drapso' dirty watter.""That sounds nice," I commented, at which he began again."Aye an' it's vera dirty watter. It's the last in the bag, an' there'stadpoles an' wee crocodiles swimmin' in't, an----""Hold hard, Stewart," said Phil, while Mac was groping about forsomething substantial to throw at his comrade's head. "Hold hard, yougrinning gorilla, and let us discover the mysterious ingredients of ourhumble fare for ourselves.""There's an auld saying," Mac grunted complacently, "that what the eyedisna see the hert disna grieve fur. If ye'll tak' ma advice, ye'll dineawa' back frae the firelicht." And we took his advice without demur.We kept a watch that night for the first time during many weeks. Thereputation of the Northern Australian natives was not such as inspiredconfidence in me. I had a wholesome dread of being speared while asleep,and these hostile savages were known to make their attacks invariablyafter the sun had set, when their tired victims were probablyslumbering, unaware of the presence of danger.Mac volunteered for the first spell of duty, and as a preliminary hecarefully drew the small shot charges from his cherished elephant-gun,and replaced them with ominous-looking buckshot cartridges."This shid dae mair than tickle them," he grimly remarked, looking at usas we lay stretched upon our sandy couches, and his face, lit up by theruddy glare of the fire, assumed an unusually malevolent expression."You've got to remember, Mac," Phil warned, "that the beggars areprobably cannibals, and as you are the fattest of the party, the naturalsequence is----""Say nae mair," our wary guardian interrupted with a deprecatory wave ofhis hand, "Spare yer in-seen-uashuns. There's nae nigger'll get nearwhile I'm daein' sentry go, bit at the worst the black deevils wud neverbile me when they could get guid tender golologist." With which darkstatement he shouldered his gun and commenced to execute what lookedlike a solemn ghost dance around the boundary of our camp fire'sillumination.[Illustration: AN EXTINCT VOLCANO WE CAMPED ON.]The sultry hours dragged slowly on, and the Southern Cross had set andrisen again in the eastern sky, yet not a sound reached our ears. Philrelieved Mac at midnight, and I in turn took his place two hours later,but the night passed without alarm.We had a very dry and unpalatable breakfast next morning; only a fewdrops of chocolate-coloured sediment remained in the canvas bag, andthis none of us cared to swallow for a variety of reasons. So we munchedour hard damper, and chewed refractory portions of tinned dog, imaginingit to be the most luxurious fare extant, though, unfortunately ourimagination was not of a very strong order. We lost no time in making astart, for the early hours were the coolest for travelling, and wewished to gain the shelter of the brush before the sun had swung rightoverhead. The camels were truly in a very bad state; they could scarcelybear their usual burdens, and reeled drunken-like for several minutesafter being loaded, but seemed to recover somewhat when a few miles hadbeen traversed. Yet, strive as we might, we could not make speedyprogress, and it was almost noon when we drew near to the timber. Theheat was becoming very intense, and in our semi-famished condition wesuffered severely."We'll camp in the most shaded part of the scrub, boys," I cried,signing to Mac to alter "Slavery's" course more to westward. Phil nowclutched my arm excitedly."Is that smoke or a light cloud-patch over the tips of these trees?" heasked, directing my gaze towards a thick clump of lime-trees that laywell ahead in the line of our changed route.I surveyed the feathery shadow indicated intently. "A native smoke,Phil," I answered, as quietly as I could, though hope sprang up withinme at the sight."What we must do, then," said Phil determinedly, "is to capture one ortwo representatives of the tribe and make them lead us to water.""Me an' Stewart'll shin attend to that," growled Mac, hearing thesuggestion with ill-concealed delight.We were now entering the outskirts of the pigmy forest, and Phil and Itook the lead of our caravan with firearms ready in case of attack;while Mac and Stewart, leading their charges warily in our tracks,peered suspiciously into the densest shadows as they passed. The shrubswere of much greater height than we had expected, and soon theysurrounded us in thick even growths through which we steered an erraticcourse with difficulty.I was about to call a halt when a thick pile of withered branches,propped against the lower heights of some half-dozen close-growingtrees, arrested my attention. "A windbreak! Go slow!" I cautioned thosein the rear; but soon we found that we were in the midst of quite anumber of these rude shelters, all of which seemed to be of very recenterection. "There is evidently a tribe in the vicinity," I said to Phil,who was gazing at the strange contrivances with much curiosity, andnoting how differently they were constructed from the crudewind-barriers met during the earlier part of our journey."They appear to work on some design here," he remarked thoughtfully;"the branches are interlaced, and the construction might ultimatelyevolve into a kind of hut or wigwam.""I am much more concerned about the whereabouts of the population," Isaid, and I glanced apprehensively through the trees; then we resumedour march. A few minutes more passed in silence as we proceeded withears alert for the slightest sound.We were, as nearly as I could guess, about midway through the forestwhen Mac suddenly gave a yell of mingled joy and surprise."Haud on! Haud on!" he shouted. "I see niggers richt forrit a wee bit.Come on, Stewart, an' we'll shin catch are or twa speecimens."Mac's information was correct. A convenient gap in the foliage had notbeen overlooked by him, and his sharp eyes had quickly taken in the viewdirectly ahead. His warning had scarcely been given when we crashedthrough a maze of windbreaks and entered a clearing in the thicket, andthere, in the centre of the open space, fully a dozen hideously scarredand painted warriors stood with spears and boomerangs upraised, gazingin our direction. Mac and Stewart were now forcing past me, and it tookPhil and me all our time to restrain their ardour. We had instinctivelyretired into the shelter of the brush, and none too soon, for a hail ofspears rustled through the willowy branches and stuck fast without doingany damage."Their spears may be poisoned," I said to the indignant pair. "You'vegot a different sort of savage to deal with in these latitudes.""They'll get awa'!" Mac roared excitedly. "They'll get awa'!""Let me gang," implored Stewart. "I'm that thin they couldna hit me, an'in ony case I'm teuch eneuch tae staun ony pison.""Get the camels sheltered, boys," I ordered; "we'll try a policy ofconciliation in the first place."My aides-de-camp grumblingly led "Slavery" and "Misery" back a fewpaces, and Phil examined the chambers of his Colt Navy with considerableimpatience. We were by no means hidden by the scraggy branches fringingthe open space, and that fact was impressed upon us most plainly whenseveral more well-directed spears glanced along the sand at our feet.Mac fumed, and the hammers of his gun came back with an ominous doubleclick. "You can cover them with your cannon," I said to him, "while Itry the powers of persuasive language," and I stepped as boldly as Icould out towards the hostile band. "Babba, babba," I cried, with myhands raised in token of peace. They gave a curious gurgle of surpriseand retreated before me as if afraid. I repeated as much of the nativejargon as I knew, with, as I thought, an exceedingly friendlyinflection. Then they recovered themselves, and came rushing towards me.I stood irresolute for an instant, for the warriors had discarded theirspears, and I wondered for a brief space whether they were now hurryingto tender their expressions of good-will. When they were within a dozenyards off, however, they united in a shrill scream, and brandished intheir right hands most bloodthirsty-looking clubs which they had carriedsecreted at their backs. Their intention could not now be doubted, and Iturned and fled."Give them the small-shot barrel, Mac," I cried."Sma' shot be d----d!" he howled in reply, and the boom of hisartillery filled my ears as he spoke.When the smoke cleared away I saw that the blacks had retreated to theextreme end of the clearing, where the bulk of them stood huddledtogether, groaning horribly, and making most frightful grimaces at us.Two feather-bedizened warriors were prancing absurdly in the middledistance, and emitting piercing shrieks as they slowly hopped back torejoin their comrades."I aimed low," said Mac apologetically, noting their antics with muchsatisfaction, "an' I dinna see what they're makin' a' that row aboot."I was glad to notice that no serious injury had been done to the poorcreatures, and, judging by the activity shown by the wounded pair, theywere evidently much more frightened than hurt."I don't think there is any more fight in them, boys," I said, and Istepped forward, followed by my companions, who tugged at thenose-ropes of the reluctant camels. A few belated missiles, flung inhalf-hearted fashion, struck the ground at our feet; the blacks stillstood in our path, glaring at us sullenly."Level your cannon again, Mac," I instructed, "but _don't_ fire."He obeyed with alacrity, just in time to check a fresh flight of spears.The natives had already acquired a wholesome dread of theformidable-looking breechloader. With ear-splitting yells they scatteredbefore our advance, and in a moment were lost to sight in the forest.We made a brief halt by the scene of their stand in order to search thenear vicinity for water, but not a drop of moisture could be locatedanywhere around. Windbreaks were very numerous some little distance backfrom the enclosure, which showed that we had practically stumbled upon anative village. Yet it must have been only a settlement used as atemporary camp between two known springs, unless the water resources ofthe district were very cunningly hidden."There must be water near at hand," said Phil. "These trees could notgrow so freshly otherwise.""We've missed our one chance, I fear," I answered him sadly. "We oughtto have captured one of the natives while we had the opportunity.""Let us go now," said he; "they cannot be very far off yet.""We'll gang! we'll gang!" Mac and Stewart cried clamorously together."We'll shin catch the deevils!"But I restrained them. "You are both too reckless," I explained, "and weshould probably never see you again if you lost your bearings in thebush." I knew that my worthy henchmen would disdain to use anystratagem, and in consequence would surely be speared by the vengefulsavages."You can trust me, Mac," said Phil grimly. "I'll fetch you a specimen ortwo to play with," and Mac, noting his unusual fierceness of expression,felt comforted.Leaving our over-eager companions in charge of the camels, I took ahurried bearing of our position, and dashed off with Phil in thedirection taken by the fleeing band. I could still hear the branchescrackling before their wild rush, and I hoped that the sound might guideus in our quest. For several minutes we kept up a rapid pace, but wequickly realised that our running powers were not equal to those of theblacks. The blistering sand showered in our faces, and the brittle twigsof the mallee cut us severely. The sun had now reached his meridian, andshot his rays so fiercely upon us that we were soon compelled to reduceour speed. We dared not allow ourselves to perspire, and so lose thelittle moisture our bodies contained. Meanwhile the vague crackling ofthe brushwood in the far distance became fainter and fainter, intimatingto us very plainly that our intended prisoners were far from our reach.We were weary and hopeless, yet we mechanically continued on. Ourthoughts, as may be guessed, were the reverse of pleasant, and we didnot care to give them expression. Few would have recognised in Phil, thefresh-faced, merry-spirited young man who had led the Five-Mile rush.His face was now deeply bronzed, and bore the stamp of the hardshipsencountered, and his firm-set mouth showed a vastly increased force ofwill."The beggars seem to have vanished completely," he said, when we hadtravelled at least half a mile in silence. "What a tidy row of skeletonswe'll make," he added lightly. "'A rale dacent coleckshun,' as Mac wouldsay.""We'll hear Mac's remarks later," I answered, "and we're not by anymeans dead yet."We had now reached a slight dip in the land surface, and in thedepression a well-padded native track appeared. We followed it eagerlyuntil it broke off into two trails, forming an acute angle."You take one, I'll take the other," I said. "If you find anythingsignal with your revolver, and I'll do the same, though it is more thanlikely they lead to the same place.""All right!" he replied, and we separated.Hurriedly I sped along, now this way, now that, as the trail twisted andtwined in the manner peculiar to most bush tracks, and I seemed to haveentered a maze. Then I came to a point where it divided and subdivided,and I hesitated, wondering which branch to follow. I went down on myknees and closely examined the sand at the junction, and after a carefulscrutiny I was rewarded by distinguishing the imprint of an aboriginal'sungainly foot at the entrance to one of the offshoots, and I hastenedalong the course indicated, half stooping and sometimes kneeling, in myextreme anxiety to keep on the pad, which could only be traced with theutmost difficulty.Gaily-plumaged birds now surrounded me, chattering noisily, and theirpresence imbued me with hope. There, indeed, must be water near, if Icould only find it. My guiding path led me several hundred yards over asand and gravel surface, through which a stray blade of wiry grasspeeped here and there; but gradually the grasses grew closer, and theirtrampled appearance showed me that some one had only recently crossedthat way. I was brought to a halt abruptly. The track had come to anend, and I stood at the edge of a small circular space, in the centre ofwhich a tall lime-tree stretched high above the stunted shrubsadjoining.The significance of the sight was not altogether lost on me. I hadusually found lime-trees and water in close proximity, but here nowelcome spring gladdened my eyes, the circle was bare andparched-looking, except on the far-away side, where a rank clump ofspinifex lined the gaunt stems of the mallee. I was bitterlydisappointed."Looks like a circus-ring," I said to myself. "Probably used for holdinggrand corroborees." I turned away in disgust, and sat down in the sand,heedless alike of snakes, scorpions, or other crawling things. I wastrying to consider what our immediate future must be, and my deductionswere not cheering. Then I wondered where Phil had gone, and whether hisquest had been more successful than mine; but I had heard no signal,therefore, I reasoned, he would be in a somewhat similar plight tomyself, or perhaps he had already rejoined Mac and Stewart. I continuedmy musings in a calmly-resigned state of mind, but was suddenly arousedto alertness; the faint sound of rustling branches reached my ears. Igot up speedily and looked all round, but nothing could be seen, and Iblamed my too eager fancy for the alarm. Glancing at the sun, and takinga rough compass bearing, I prepared to return to my companions by adirect route through the bush. But again the peculiar sound attracted myattention. My fancy had not deceived me this time, and I surveyed theopen space closely, but nothing met my anxious gaze. Then, just as I wasleaving the scene, the secret of the rustling branches was revealed, andI smiled grimly at my lack of perception. On the extreme edge of theclearing, half hidden by the spidery tendrils of the sparse fringingbush, two natives lay sprawling on the sand, carefully piling a heap oftwigs and spinifex grass, as if in preparation for a large fire. Theylay with their backs towards me, pursuing their work with diligence, andas the colour of their bodies was almost similar to that of theirsurroundings, they were not easily observable, as I had already proved.I noticed with satisfaction that their weapons were strewn in the grasssome few yards out of their reach. These comprised two evil-lookingwaddies and a number of double-barbed spears--a formidable collection,truly. I examined my small S. and W. revolver with purposeful intent,and was on the point of rushing forward when a loud crackle came fromanother part of the ring. It seemed to me as if a stout branch had givenway before some other, and more impetuous, watcher than myself. Morenatives might be near. I drew back into the shadow. The dusky pair wereevidently wildly alarmed; they leapt to their feet and looked about witha startled expression, and then I recognised them as two of those whohad so stubbornly contested our advance less than an hour back. Theyglared at each other terror-stricken, and pointed to the sun and thefour corners of the earth in turn, accompanying their odd gesticulationsby a stream of monosyllabic utterances. Apparently they were invokingvarious gods to their aid. In the midst of this pantomime a well-knownfigure burst into the enclosure from the still swaying scrub, and beforethe natives could escape he clutched them both in a tight embrace, andbore them back by almost superhuman effort."Phil!" I cried in amazement, jumping forward, and relieving him of oneof his prisoners."We've got them!" he shouted with fierce emotion. "Keep still, you impof darkness!"His prisoner was still struggling violently, but soon realised thehopelessness of his efforts, and became quiescent as mine, who wasrolling his eyes at me beseechingly.Then we looked at each other, half in amusement half in surprise, and Inoticed that his sole upper garment, his sand-stained shirt, was tornhalf across the shoulders."It caught in a branch," he explained, examining the rent ruefully, "andthe noise I made in breaking loose nearly frightened the blacks away.""But how did you get here?" I asked, for the tracks we had followedseemed to lead very widely apart."The trails intersect, but all find their way here," he answered."Anyhow, I've been watching these beggars building a monument, orsomething like it, for the last five minutes or so.""I have had my eye on them also," I said, "but I didn't dream of yourbeing so close. Hold my prisoner a moment," I added; "we'll see whatthey have been doing."He promptly sat on my savage's neck, while I got up and kicked away thepile of branches. And lo! beneath them lay disclosed a gurgling springof clearest water.I could not describe the joy that was ours at that moment. Phil simplygasped with relief, and was not satisfied that his eyes did not deceivehim until I lifted some of the sparkling liquid in the palm of my handand let it trickle slowly through my fingers. The blacks remainedpassive enough now, only groaning dismally at intervals. It was notdifficult to understand why they had attempted to hide the spring. AsStewart had first surmised, they did not want our good company, and whocould blame them? There was no need to rejoin our comrades now, so wedischarged our revolvers as a signal to them to approach, and soon theirfamiliar voices were heard far back raised in high debate. Mac wasapparently holding forth on some pet doctrine with which Stewartdoggedly refused to coincide. They had forced their thoughts far awayfrom unpleasant topics; they knew how necessary it was to keep up asemblance of cheerfulness in trying times, and for the rest they trustedto my greater experience and Phil's superior knowledge.The dwarfed trees broke before the advancing train. Poor old "Slavery"was evidently leading the trail at a harder pace than usual."Come alang, 'Slavery'! Wad ye hae me pu' ye?" I heard Mac's voiceraised in pathetic entreaty, as the swaying brush about a hundred yardsback betokened their near approach. A few minutes more and "Slavery" and"Misery" staggered into the clearing, with Mac and Stewart pullingstrenuously at their nose-ropes. The poor beasts' eyes were gleamingstrangely, and their breath came in long wheezing groans."We can hang oot anither day yet," Mac shouted encouragingly immediatelyhe saw us, trying bravely to look cheerful. Then when he noticed thenatives on whom we were comfortably seated his astonishment was great."Guid heavens!" he ejaculated. "Stewart, we've got them efter a'."But Stewart had caught sight of the glistening water, and with a ferventexclamation he buried his face in it and drank deeply. The camels now,feeling the tension relieved at their nose-ropes, sank upon their kneesdead beat, and their heads drooped in the sand. Phil and I watched thescene in silence: it was as the last act of a drama, with the proverbialhappy ending. Mac's rugged features fairly glowed when he saw the savingspring. He strode forward, and jerked his comrade's dripping face fromthe water. "Dinna mak' a beast o' yersel'," he said shortly. "Owermuckle's bad for ye, an' it's ma turn onywey." But they found room fortwo heads, and Phil said they reduced the level of the water by severalinches.The camels' wants now received attention. We allowed them to drinksparingly only, as they would quickly have drained the well, whichrefilled very slowly; but before the day was out they had absorbed theirfull supply, and were on a fair way towards the recovery of their wontedvigour. We camped by the spring, which we named "Warriors' Well," fortwo days, during which time we were engaged filling the greatwater-bags, and patching our tattered clothing so as to make arespectable appearance when we arrived at the nearest settlement, nowless than a hundred miles distant. We fed our prisoners lavishly ontinned dog and flour while they remained in our charge, and they seemedto appreciate the diet hugely; yet, do what we might, they retainedtheir sullen demeanour, and always howled plaintively when we approachednear them. They made their escape on the morning of our departure, muchto Mac's disgust. That worthy had conceived the idea of training them toact in the capacity of body-servants to Stewart and himself."They would hae been bonnie orniments tae tak' hame tae auld Scotland,"he said regretfully."We'll be bonnie-like orniments oorsels, Mac," responded Stewart,surveying his dark-brown skin. "We'll be nigger enough like, I'mthinkin'."We resumed our march with lighter hearts than we had had for many a day.Our journey was practically completed, for our water supply would nowlast until we reached comparatively sure country. It is true we had notbenefited by the expedition as I had hoped when starting, but we hadgained a hard knowledge of the country, and of our own powers ofendurance under extremely adverse circumstances, which would proveinvaluable to us in the further journeyings I was at this stageplanning. Phil had become indissolubly connected with my little party.His worth had been demonstrated over and over again, and it was withpleasure I heard his decision, as we drew near settled latitudes, tothrow in his lot with mine in my future travels.[Illustration: THE ONLY CREATURES THAT CAN EXIST IN THE N.W. INTERIOR.]"Ye're a man o' pairts, Phil," was Mac's unhesitating verdict, andStewart added, as a fitting tribute, "I'm o' the same opeenion."Twelve days after leaving the providentially-found spring we arrived onthe north-west coast of Australia, and there disposed of our faithfulold camels to ready purchasers. Mac's eyes were moist when he saidgood-bye to the gentle "Slavery," and Stewart was loath to part with hisold charge, "Misery." As they were led away I bestowed a benediction onthe trusty servants of our dreary journey, and elicited a promise fromtheir new possessor that he would treat them kindly as they deserved.About a week later we sailed for Sydney.PART IIIPROMISCUOUS WANDERINGSIN THE AUSTRALIAN BACK-BLOCKSAustralia has attracted much attention from all quarters during the lastfew years, but to most people the vast interior is still a _terraincognita_; and even on the streets of Sydney or Melbourne theappearance of a copper-skinned back-blocker excites as much comment asmight a being from another planet. The man from "out west" cares littlefor the opinion of the townsman, however; and if his carriage be not sograceful as that of those whom he so unceremoniously jostles on thepavements of Bourke Street or the "Block," he gets over the ground morequickly; and if his speech be ungrammatical, it is at least expressive,and only used when absolutely necessary.The back-blocks, generally, are the western division of Queensland andNew South Wales; and although in some parts of the former State thehardy squatter has established himself well out into the great desert,the country inside the "run" of his domain is probably unprospected, andoutside entirely unexplored. In this almost boundless tract of country,where the bush merges into the silent desert, the back-blocker has hishome, and, indifferent to the flight of time and the struggle andworries attending existence in the outside world, he leads a life ofuntrammelled independence.Only occasionally does a stranger come among these sons of freedom; andif he once sees "where the pelican builds its nest," or experiences thestrange fascination of the desert camp-fire circle, he will not soonleave them. The new-comer may be fresh from the old home-land, anoutcast from continental Europe, or a wanderer from the crowded citieson the Australian coast-line; but in all cases he is welcomed, and soonhe speaks in the same quaint dialect, forgets his past, and becomes achild of fortune."But how do you manage to exist? This place would not support a rabbit,"I said to an assembly of those men one evening in Queensland. I hadstruck their camp while endeavouring with a companion to cycle fromSpencer Gulf to the Gulf of Carpentaria; and our surprise may beimagined when, hundreds of miles from the nearest settlement, as wethought, their camp-fire suddenly appeared in front of us. There wereabout twelve men in the party, and, as it was just sundown, we naturallycamped beside them, and, prompted by the somewhat elaborate preparationsbeing made for supper, I had put my question."Oh, not too bad," a tall and gaunt Queenslander answered. "We keeps ateam of our own always on the move with stores from the nearesttownship.""But that must cost a lot of money so far out as this. How do youearn----?""We can always make tucker shootin' kangaroos and emus for their skins;an' if any man wants a cheque bad, for a spell or anything, he canalways go shearing inside country. Of course we takes turns at opalling,if we strikes a good show; an' if thar's any new gold discoveries, wegit there quick an' lively.""But you can never make a fortune at work so uncertain?""Lor'! mate, but you is hard to please. Here, Charlie; you lend a handhere; this stranger's fresh, an' I is no good pitchin'----" Charliestepped forward, and at once relieved his comrade of the burden ofconversation.[Illustration: AN EMU'S NEST.]"You reckons we can't make no money?" he said. "Well, I reckons ye iswrong. How about old Tyson, the millioner? An' how about Gilgai Charliesitting over there?--my handle is Vic Charlie, cos' I comes fromVictoria--he made four thousan' clear outen his opal claim only lastweek; an', darn it all, mate! there's Shandy Bill, that little fellow onyer left, he made ten ounces yesterday jes' by dry-blowing in a pan----""Ten ounces! of copper?""No--of gold; an' Long Tom here shot one hundred and twenty-threekangaroos at ninepence each----""Did you say that your companion found gold?""I reckon I did, stranger, an' what's more, we has all dropped on togold.""What! There is no gold so far west as this.""So we was told, mate. Them as is supposed to know, say there can be nogold west of the ranges; but you can allow that this push knows goldwhen they see it, an'--but show it to him, Shandy." Shandy instantlydetached a leather pouch from his belt, and without a word put it intomy hands."That is gold without doubt," I said, handing it back; "I know by theweight." Vic Charlie seemed surprised at my knowledge of the metal, buthe said nothing."Does you know much about minerals?" inquired an elderly man who hadbeen listening intently to the conversation."I have prospected in most countries," I answered, "and ought to knowall that is worth knowing by this time, for the experience was about allI did get.""Tucker!" sang out some one. "Git table-covers for the visitors, an'look lively." My own companion, while I was talking, had been engaged insimilar fashion in the centre of another group, and I smiled to see howintensely interested were his listeners. _He_ was not seekinginformation, I knew, but from the unconscious ejaculations whichfrequently arose from his audience, I guessed that he was impartingsome; and his selections were invariably strange and wonderful. The cryof "Tucker," however, created a diversion, and during the half-hour thatfollowed, all apparently had but one object in view, and being blessedwith a healthy appetite, that same object was very pleasing to me. I wasplaced between a gentleman called Dead-broke Peter and one dubbed SilentTed. I afterwards discovered that Peter had been a member of the NewZealand Parliament, but Long Tom introduced him simply as the besttalker in camp. I suppose it was to balance matters that the thoughtfulTom placed Ted on my other side, for _he_ never spoke."He is a first-class cook an' a most extraordinar' thinker, though,"said Tom; and as Ted's corrugated but wonderfully expressive face beamedat the compliment, I saw that a tongue to him was quite unnecessary. Thenight was very dark, and as the fitful fire-flashes lit up thesurrounding gloom and cast fantastic shadows of the squatting men on thesands behind them, the scene was indeed weird. Towards the end of themeal Dead-broke Peter began a conversation, at first very general incharacter, and which I easily sustained without interrupting my study ofthe men around; but before I realised that Peter was a man with a past,I found myself floundering in the subject of astronomy hopelessly beyondmy depths."Yes," I said, endeavouring to collect my senses, "it is wonderful howthe science has advanced, but I cannot understand how you have made theheavens a clock.""Oh, that is a simple matter," he replied. "Canopus sets behind Warregoplains at half-past nine at present; take that fact for your unit, andthen the positions of the Cross will indicate plainly, even to minutes,the divisions of the night. But look at that poor snake crawling out ofthe hollow stump beside you; that means a cyclonic disturbance isapproaching----""Great Scot! That's a black snake. Look out, boys!" I cried, springingto my feet. Ted, who had been drinking in every word spoken, quietlyreached over, and catching the wriggling creature by the tail, skilfullyswung it round his shoulder and brought its head forcibly against thelog. The snake must have been killed instantly: but its long bodyquivered convulsively for a moment, and then with a sudden jerk shotbackwards and coiled tightly round Ted's arm. To my surprise, none ofhis comrades troubled even to look at Ted during this performance: all,with the exception of Peter and himself, were absorbing the words of myvery Scotch companion, who was relating with powerful dramatic effectsome peculiar experiences of his in other parts of the world. Butevidently Ted did not expect any attention, for without uttering a soundhe arose, shook his encumbrance into the fire, and sat down again, witha look on his face that plainly said to us, "Go on! What have youstopped for?"Peter politely directed my gaze to a nine-inch centipede that wasprospecting across my boots, and then launched into a discourse ontheological matters, which in time led into the supernatural, andfinally narrowed down to a discussion on the mysterious rites of theaborigines' Bora."Little Bob, that tall man sitting next your companion, has had muchexperience among the natives of the north," Peter said, "and if youcould only get him to talk he could tell some marvellous tales."I looked over to the other side of the fire, and saw that Little Bob wasthe individual who had asked the extent of my mineral knowledge. "I haveheard some tall stories of their corroborrees, Ghingis, and Bunyips," Ianswered; "but no white man has ever seen anything that could not beeasily explained.""Think not? Perhaps you are right, but my experience leads me to thinkdifferently. There is a Bunyip's pool seventeen miles from here--infact, we get our water from it; but there is not a man in this camp whowould go near it at night for--well for anything. And as for thecorroborrees, there are men here who have actually gone through a seriesof them, and if you stay with us, or travel northwards, you willprobably see some for yourself."Peter's words interested me greatly, so, careful not to interrupt hisflow of eloquence, I soon became as silent as the gentleman on my left,and was rewarded by hearing a most wonderful account of the dreadedBunyip--that strange mysterious creature, half fish and half fiend, thevery sight of which, it is said, means death to the unfortunatebeholder. I had often heard of this "dweller in the waters" fromhalf-caste aborigines in New South Wales, and knew that it was supposedto live in the subterranean pools which abound throughout the Australianinterior; but I never imagined that white men could be so firmlyconvinced of its existence as were my present companions."It's in the Brumbie's water-hole, you can bet your life," said astrangely deformed man, who had joined our group when the name wasmentioned."How do you know? Have you seen it?" I inquired."No, an' doesn't want to; but Jack Ford did.""And where is he?""Ask Sam Wilkins. He's the only glory prospector here.""What has he to do with it?""Lor'! stranger, if he doesn't know where Jack went, no one here does.Jack was as fine a mate as iver I met; but whether he staked off aclaim up aloft, or pegged out in the other place, I'm darned if I knows.He saw the Bunyip one full moon, an' croaked the next day."I now noticed that all the men had gathered round our little group, andbefore I could further question the speaker, Long Tom broke in. "Is yein a hurry to git up to the Gulf country?" he said."Not particularly," I answered."Yer mate tells us you is a great mineralogist?""Oh, no,--not great; but I know a little of the science.""Does ye know what that is?" Tom opened a sack as he spoke and took outa greenish mass of something."That is copper sulphide. Where did you get it?""Mate, if it's any good, there's hundreds and thousands o' tons o' itlyin' on top not mor'n fifty mile from here. But what is this?""Why, that is native silver; and that conglomeration in Ted's hand is anironstone formation carrying gold----""Say, mate," interrupted Little Bob, "does ye know what this is?" Heheld in the palm of his hand a mixture resembling tea in appearance, butwhich after tasting I knew could not be that substance, "Ah! ye isbested, mate, an' I is glad," continued Bob. "I knows ye is honest now,an' don't skite when ye doesn't know.""Thank you; but what is it?""Pidcherie, stranger. Money can't buy it. It comes from the Mullagineswamps; an' gold nor lead wouldn't make a black fellow part with it.Swallow that, an' you can dance in the fire an' not feel nothin'; cutyourself in little bits an' you'll think it fun. Only the niggers knowswhat it is, an' no white men barrin' us back boys has iver got any----""Time for that again, Little Bob," cried Long Tom, "The question justnow is, Will the stranger jine us? Yous can git two shares an' we doesall the work," he added, turning to me."But, Mr.--that is--Peter here knows more than I do. He----""Him!" snorted Tom. "Mate, he's the most onreasonable man in camp. Whenhe starts talking we can't stop him; an' when he is stopped, darn me ifwe can start him." I turned to see how my late entertainer took thesewords, but he was lying back on the sand--asleep. Finally, after muchquaint reasoning, the men persuaded us to try our luck with them, atleast for a time. "Yous can leave us when you like, if it doesn't pay,"was Tom's summing up; but as he had just told me of a sand-patch inwhich tucker could be made by dry-panning, and of a "darned curiouscountry across the Cooper" which was on fire with opal lying on thesurface, I thought that the adventure was well worth any risk in thatdirection. We were still talking when the Southern Cross dipped behindthe Grey Ranges; but before we stretched ourselves on the sand to restit was decided that I and three others should set out in the morning toinspect the opal formations beyond the Cooper, and pending our report asto its value, the others would keep up the funds by kangaroo-shootingand dry-blowing for gold.Next morning with the first faint streaks of dawn we were ready. Mac andI had our cycles, which we stripped of all their previous accoutrements,and Kangaroo George and Gilgai Charlie rode two of the finest horses inQueensland."Be good boys," cried Long Tom, as we prepared to move off afterbreakfast."There is a willy-willy coming soon, so watch where you camp," warnedDead-broke Peter; and without more ado we plunged into a clump ofgidgyas, and in a few minutes burst out on the ironshot plain. NeitherGeorge nor Charlie was inclined to waste his wisdom on the desert air,and even Mac found it advisable to keep his mouth closed when the fineclouds of sand began to rise. For hours we headed due west, dining atnoon, in the open, on a piece of damper and some cold mutton, washeddown with an extremely sparing amount of muddy fluid from ourwater-bags, and then going on again. Before sundown we reached adried-up creek, where, after scraping in the sand among the roots of asolitary lime-tree, we found sufficient liquid for the horses, which wethen hobbled and went into camp, fully forty miles from ourstarting-point. The sun was now racing down on the western horizon, andthe desert around seemed like a sea of gold. The day had beenoppressively hot, and consequently we expected that night would be keptlively by the many pests. Nor were we mistaken. Just as our surroundingsbecame blurred in the shadows of night a dingo's dismal howl broke thestrange stillness, and then the blood-curdling shrieks of somelaughing-jackasses in the tree above irritated us almost beyondendurance. The mosquitoes next joined in, sinking their sawlike suckersdeep into our sun-blistered skin; and when the mournful "morepork" addedits depressing note, the desert orchestra was completed."I reckon there's a storm comin'," remarked George, as he assisted asmall death-adder into the fire."For onysake let it come, then," growled Mac. "A dinna see what ye'vegot to complain aboot. Da----darn it!!""Is ye bit, Scottie?" inquired Charlie. "Lor'! there's a centipede onyour neck. It feels like red-hot coal, doesn't it?" he addedsympathetically."No," groaned Mac; "it's a rale cooling sensation; but, here, feel foryersel'." He poised the creature on a twig as he spoke, and skilfullylanded it on Charlie's back, and the yell that followed might haveawakened a Bunyip, had there been such a monster within five miles."Shut up! darn ye, Charlie!" roared George, lifting a nicely browneddamper from the ashes; "ye has set the black fellows' ghosts off again.Lor'! just listen to 'em.""Hurry up with that damper, George," I interrupted--"that is, if there'sno snakes in it.""There's many things worse than snakes, boss," innocently repliedGeorge; "they is prime, if ye roast 'em an' has got any salt----""Haud yer tongue, man, or A'll mak' a corroborree o' ye," roared thehungry Mac, and I had to interfere hastily to prevent bloodshed.The memory of that night's tortures still haunts me. The desert wasalive with all sorts of reptiles and insects, and from my companions, asthey rolled sleeplessly in the sand, many short but heartfeltexpressions arose which I dare not repeat. At sunrise we set out again,and all day travelled westward over country similar to that which we hadalready passed, camping at night on an "Ana" branch or backwater of thefamous Cooper, and enduring another night of misery."I reckon we should be near the Ghingi's opal now," said George as weresumed our journey on the third day; "but say, boss, what's wrong withthe ole sun? or is it the willy-willy?" There certainly was reason forGeorge's question, for the sun as it shot up over the edge of the plainsseemed merely a dull red ball; but the gem-shot haze which dancedbetween showed the cause, and I realised that a cloud formed of minuteparticles of sand was partly obscuring it from view."We'll get across the main river and look for shelter," I said, "forevidently this storm has been working up for some days." We crossed the"Ana" channel and proceeded slowly, for the ground was now broken up asif by volcanic agencies. I was anxious to see the Cooper, the greatinland sea of the early pioneers, but to my astonishment no water wasyet in evidence as far as the eye could reach; so, leading our steeds,we picked our way over the cleft and burnt ironstone."These is the Ghingi's holes," said Charlie, as we came to someunusually large and deep chasms, "an' keep your eyes open, for thereshould be opal here.""Whaur has that patent river got tae, I wunner," muttered Mac. "I neverhad muckle faith in Australian rivers, an' I doot the nearest water-holein the way we're goin' is the Indian Ocean.""Say, boss," suddenly said George, "how far is it to the war?""Oh, South Africa is about seven thousand miles from here. Are youthinking of going?""Well, some of the boys was talking that way; but none o' us knew thecountry, nor if the track was to sunrise or sundown.""Africa is west from here, George.""Is ther enuff water for horses on the trail?""Why, man! you cross the ocean.""Well, I reckon old Joy here can cross anything; but it beats me to knowhow a fellow can carry tucker. I s'pose there is plenty stations on theroad, though?" I looked at George in amazement, and Mac grinned withdelight."Maybe they wouldn't want us, Kangaroo," put in Charlie; "but I reckonwe can ride anything as has feet, an' shoot----""Lie down flat, mates!" shouted George; "here's the willy-willy."I turned and saw a huge black wall gyrating wildly towards us. A roarlike that of thunder filled the air, followed by a sound as of wavesbreaking upon a rocky beach. A fierce blast of back-drawn sand struck myface, and as I threw myself down I felt as if drowning for a moment;then a hail of stones, scrub, and sand rushed over me, tearing myclothes to shreds, and penetrating my skin like shot, while a thickblackness blotted out everything around. I lay still, conscious that adeposit of sand was fast covering me; but I also felt that thesuffocating tension was already becoming less severe, and next minute acurrent of moist cool air, delightfully soothing to my sand-blastedskin, swept over the desert, and I sat up. It was still dark; but theawful vortex had passed, and away to the west I could still hear theindescribable rumbling sound of the flying boulders among the Ghingiholes."Is we all here?" sounded Charlie's voice close beside me, and I feltrelieved when I heard the muffled responses of my comrades, for I knewthat if caught in the centre of such a storm we had just escaped,nothing living could withstand it. I groped for my cycle, and moistenedmy throat with the damp sand that now filled the water-bag, noticing, assome of the contents spilled down my neck, that the temperature musthave fallen considerably, for the accident caused me to shiver."Ye talk aboot gaun into the Australian interior," spoke Mac dolorously,as he in turn swallowed a mouthful, "but I'm thinkin' that a lot o'Australia has gone into mine.""Never mind, Mac," I replied, as we all crawled towards each other,"here comes the first rain we have had since leaving Adelaide, and ifthe horses are all right, so are we.""I reckon they is O.K.," said Charlie; "they knows more than mostpeople, them horses."While he was speaking we cast off our scanty garments and revelled inthe refreshing drops; but rain in the back-blocks is worth more than itsweight in gold, and this shower only lasted about a minute, and passedon in the wake of the willy-willy. Shortly afterwards the darknessrolled away to the west like a huge receding screen, and near us we sawthe two horses rolling on the ground with evident enjoyment. But I didnot ask my companions how it was that our four-footed friends hadescaped so lightly, for my attention was attracted by a scintillatingstreak of something on the edge of a small hole, and as my eyes becameused to the now blinding glare of the sun, I saw that the whole surfaceof the desert was literally blazing with small points of colour."Lor'!" exclaimed my Australian comrades simultaneously, "we has struckthe very place after all.""Ay, mon," said Mac wrathfully; "an' hoo did ye no' ken that afore?""'Cos the opal was dead," replied George, "an' the rain has made it'live again."Mac looked suspiciously at the speaker; but Charlie added that "dead"and "live" were terms used in speaking of dull opal that could be madeto flash as if alive by the application of water. This explained why wehad not seen the gems before, and without troubling to inquire where theCooper had gone, or how--if Charlie and George were correct--we had gotto the other side of it, we attacked the ironstone boulders with oursmall hand-picks."Every gibber's got an opal heart," remarked George, smashing a largeboulder to fragments."Take care, then," I warned, "or you will break it too.""Then how is we to do it, boss?" inquired Charlie, poising his pick inmid-air. "Does ye think it will come out if we whistle on it?"I did not; nor to this day have I found how to get that opal out intact.We tried every method that could be devised, but without success, foreach time we broke the outer casing the more brittle core was alsoshattered by the blow. Patiently and laboriously we chipped theironstone, only to find that the gem was in powder form when we reachedit. We then tried roasting the stones, carrying them to a small clump ofstunted gidgyas for that purpose; but found then, that although theshell broke with less hammering, the "life" of the opal was destroyed bythe heat, and a dull lump of glass-like substance was all our reward.For two days we wandered among the Ghingi holes trying specimenscontinually, but with the same results, and at last I was convinced thatfurther work under the circumstances was useless. The horses were nowbeginning to suffer for want of proper food, and I saw that the waterquestion would also trouble us as soon as the pools formed by thewilly-willy shower had evaporated. Cooper's creek as a flowing streamhad ceased to exist. Probably its waters, or all that seven years'drought had left of them, had gone to feed that strange tide which ebbsand flows so mysteriously under the heart of the great Lone Land; but inits old channels we saw only dead and dying creatures of the desert, andthe banks were simply a nursery for fever germs."I reckon we'll have to give it best," at length said Gilgai Charlie,and I could see no alternative."If sufficient rain came, we might be able to bring a team out," I said,"and cart a load of boulders back to Eromango. If we could not there getthe ironstone dissolved with acid, we could at least send them toBrisbane and get them cut.""That's all right, boss," spoke George, "but I reckon we might as welllook for gold nuggets droppin' from the sky as enough water for ateam." And I knew he was right.[Illustration: "LEICHARDT'S" TREE.               THE LAST TRACE FOUND OF THE GREAT EXPLORER WHO ATTEMPTED               TO CROSS THE INTERIOR AND WAS NEVER HEARD OF AGAIN.]We thought of striking across to the central ranges of South Australiato prospect the ruby formations there, but we found, when we reached theend of the broken ground, that our course lay through a belt of softsand in which our wheels sank over the rims; and having neithersufficient water nor stores to risk walking for an unknown distance, wewere forced to abandon the attempt. On the afternoon of the third day westarted on the back track, and that night camped on the Ana pool. Wemade our old camp by the "soak" the next night, and at noon, the dayfollowing, struck the camps of those of our comrades who had gonedry-blowing."Well, mates, don't worry. It doesn't matter anyhow, for we'll git itsome day, if we doesn't peg out," was the general comment when they hadheard our story; and then the billy was boiled.I was much surprised to see that gold was present in the sands of thedesert; and even although the quantity was small, and only in patcheswidely apart, the fact afforded much food for thought. The process ofdry-blowing adopted by the men was extremely simple, consisting ofdropping the sand from one pan raised above the head to another restingon the ground, then reversing the positions of the pans and repeatingthe operation. In action, most of the sand and other light material wascarried away or diverted by the wind; but the gold--if any--inaccordance with the law of gravitation, dropped straight. When the bulkwas thus reduced until only the precious metal and the heavierironstones were left, the contents were put aside, and another panfulproceeded with in the same manner. Finally the collected matter wasthrown on an improvised inclined plane that had bars of wood fastenedacross its surface. In rolling down, the ironstone pebbles clearedthese ripples and fell to the ground; but the gold, being too heavy todo likewise, was caught in the angles, and afterwards carefully removedby the operator. The work was very slow and laborious, and oftenattended with very disappointing results. "But," said Dead-broke Peter,while explaining this to me, "we sometimes strike a patch that payswell.""Can you explain why there is _any_ gold here?" I asked. "There are noauriferous reefs which could shed it nearer than eight hundred miles,and, according to all geologists, the entire desert is the deposit ofthe ocean.""That may be," Peter replied, "but I have conclusive proof that there isa gold-bearing reef not more than a quarter of a mile from where westand. I have no doubt that the rocks carrying it once reared themselvesabove the surrounding sea; but that was--well--before our time; and nowthey are too deep for us to reach."I suggested that if the men had some mechanical appliance which couldtreat the sand in large quantities, they might do well with the surfacedeposit. "Perhaps," Peter said indifferently; "but there would be toomuch worry attached." And seeing that Silent Ted had dinner ready, wechanged the subject.Long Tom and four of the men had gone out emu-and kangaroo-shooting, andwere not expected back for a week, and knowing that neither Mac nor Icould be of any special service to the men at dry-blowing, we at lengthresolved to proceed to the Gulf, as was our original intention.Our companions were very sorry when we announced this; but I told themwe had come out expressly to study the aborigines at home, and that whenwe had done so we might come back."You'll see them before you go far," said Shandy Bill."An' don't go foolin' near a corroborree, Scottie," warned Little Bob;"'cos if ye does thar will be a funeral, as sure as them currants inthat damper there is only ants."Dead-broke Peter was evidently qualifying for a Silent Ted reputation,for it was only when kicked repeatedly by that individual that he rousedhimself, and in effect said, "Remember, if you happen to get intotrouble, that the various corroborrees are only stages in the grandBora; and that the signs used in their working have a wonderfulresemblance to those of a certain society to which I see you belong."This information was startling, to say the least of it; but Peter hadagain fallen into his listless attitude, and could not be induced to saymore: so, after receiving many messages, written and verbal, to despatchfrom the first settlement reached, we departed.Eight days later we crossed the north Cooper (here called the Thomsonriver) at Jundah--it was in flood here(!)--and in another four days wereached Winton. From this unique township we made good time northwardsthrough a well-watered country, which, although in the tropics, isblessed with a pleasant climate; and while running down the Flindersriver had our first adventure with the natives. The Australianaboriginal is believed to be the lowest form of humanity extant; butthere are many things in his philosophy of which the white man has notdreamt. He fights with nature for his very existence, his food being thecrawling creatures of the earth and what he wrests from other animals;and even then he is haunted with an eternal dread of devouring demons,who--according to his belief--are for ever seeking his destruction. HisBora is his only safeguard against these Ghingis and Bunyips; and it isin matters pertaining to the observance of its various corroborreesthat he has achieved such triumphs over nature, and performs feats that,to the white man, are entirely inexplicable.An ordinary corroborree is merely a meeting that may be summoned by thechief or elders of any tribe; but those relating to the Bora are aseries of religious ceremonials culminating in a weird fire-test, whichall young warriors must undergo before attaining to the state ofmanhood. This fire-test, with various modifications, is also practisedby the New Guineans and South Sea Islanders; but with the latter it nowseems to have degenerated into a performance for the priests alone; andin the Fiji Isles a form of fire-walking is still observed, chiefly forthe benefit of the sensation-loving tourist. Among the Australianaborigines, however, the working of the Bora is the chief object oftheir existence, and with them the tests are very real indeed. Thefire-test is worked by a procession of aspiring natives marching roundon a path which leads through the centre of many fires. A figure in thefanciful attire of some strange monster apparently controls themovements of the warriors by the motion of some object which he swingsrapidly round his head, and which produces a humming sound not unlikethat of a steam-siren. The performance is followed by a warlike displaysupposed to strike terror to the heart of the dreaded Bunyip, and ifthat creature could see the grotesquely garbed warriors as we sawthem--hiding in the mulga scrub with our bicycles lying beside us--Ihave no doubt that it would speedily take itself off to some lessdangerous-looking part of the globe.It is supposed that no white men have ever witnessed the highercorroborrees; but that belief is erroneous, for during our journeynorthwards we met several backblockers on the wallaby to the opaldistrict who were quite familiar with the entire ceremony, and some,like little Bob, had even taken part in them, of course not willingly.The aborigines are very scarce now, and happily, perhaps for us, most ofour adventures with them tended more to be ludicrous than exciting, andin due course we arrived at Normanton, the chief town in the Gulfcountry.A month later we landed at Brisbane from the ss. _Peregrine_, and in twodays were completely tired out and disgusted with the artificialities ofcity life. The Queensland contingent of the Imperial Bushmen was toembark in the afternoon for South Africa, and we joined the cheeringthrong that lined Queen Street to see the men ride past. I have seen theScots Greys in Edinburgh, but the men of "England's last hope" were notlike them. Their smart dresses hung loosely on their angular frames, andtheir tanned faces were in vivid contrast to those of the Brisbanites.They were all tall, and sat in their saddles in a style that wascertainly not military, and their faces wore an absent-mindedexpression. I knew, however, that fever would have no effect on thesemen, that they could stand any hardship, that an earthquake could notunhorse them, and that every time those eyes with the far-away lookglanced along the rifle-barrel something would drop somewhere. A shoutfrom Mac interrupted my musings, and knowing that he always had somereason for what he did, I followed him through the densely-packed crowd,and found him in the act of hauling a trooper from his horse."It's Kangaroo George!" he yelled, "an' he's dreamin'!""Hallo, Scottie!" suddenly said the roused warrior; "did yous see thenigs?""Hang the niggers!" roared Mac; "it's you I want tae ken aboot.Hoo----?""I see you have got on to the South African trail after all, George," Isaid, grasping his hand."Close up there, men!" roared the sergeant."Darn it! Dead-broke, doesn't ye see who is here?" remonstrated anotherfamiliar voice, and next instant I was shaking hands with SergeantDead-broke Peter--I never knew his other name. There was now a generalconfusion owing to the men having to lead their horses down to the wharfwhere the transport _Maori King_ was waiting to receive them, and byadopting tactics not unknown nearer home Mac and I got down with thetroopers."An' has ye not a word for Shandy Bill?" suddenly spoke another voice atmy side."An' Sam Wilkins?" said a quiet-looking trooper."An' me--Corporal Vic Charlie?" cried the one who had remonstrated withhis sergeant."Is the whole camp here?" I cried surprisedly, while Mac mutteredstrange words anent the results of shaving on a person's appearance."No; only five," answered Vic Charlie. "Gilgai and Little Bob came downtoo; but they were too old, an' they is goin' out west again to-nightwhen they see us away.""I say, boss," whispered George to me, "you knows the trail, doesn'tye?""Fairly well, George," I replied; "you see the Southern Cross all theway.""Then can you give us a notion how far out our first camp is?""You don't camp at all. You travel night and day--that is, unless thepropellor shaft or something else breaks.""Lor!" was all George's comment, but his face spoke volumes.[Illustration: A FAMOUS MINE IN THE GULF COUNTRY.]We stayed with our old comrades until the last moment arrived; and then,in company with Gilgai Charlie and the giant Little Bob, who had joinedus on the wharf, went and dined. These two worthies were, as they said,already "full up with the city," and when the western express left thatnight it had on board four men and four cycles booked through forCunnamulla _en route_ to the opal fields. Twenty-eight hours afterwardswe landed at the western terminus, and taking advantage of the full moonand the hard camel-pads leading farther west, we made sixty miles beforemorning.ON THE OPAL FIELDS OF WHITE CLIFFSThere are many strange places and peoples in this world, and of thosethe opal fields and opal miners of White Cliffs, New South Wales, aregood examples. The opal district is situated sixty miles N.N.W. ofWilcannia, a somewhat remarkable township on the Darling River, and themen who make gem-hunting their profession number over two thousand. Ofthis amount, less than a half belong to some branch of the Anglo-Saxonrace, the remainder being a mixture of all nationalities, of whichGermans are the most numerous. The township of White Cliffs stands in ahollow in the centre of the "workings," but it is merely a collection ofgalvanised iron drinking saloons and stores; the population living outon their claims, some in tents, some in their horizontal excavations or"drives"; and others with only the sky for a roof. When it is statedthat the town also contains a Warden's residence, a hospital, and a goodsubstantial prison--there is as yet no church--that most of the storesare run by Chinamen, and that the Jew gem-buyers form the aristocracy,the description of the town is complete. The fields, however, at presentextend for three miles round the town, and in all probability willstretch further out on the great western desert when some means ofproviding sufficient water for the miners is devised. But the opal hasbeen proved to exist in such vast quantities within the three milesradius, that there is as yet no need for any one to go further out.The methods employed in searching for opal are extremely simple.Briefly, this consists of sinking a shaft, or, if the claim happens tobe located on a slope, tunnelling into the ground until a seam ofgem-carrying matrix is encountered; from which the opal is thenseparated by means of a small "gouging" pick or other tool. These layersexist at various parallel levels from the surface down to forty feet,but no "paying" opal has yet been struck at greater depths. It is highlyprobable, however, that this is because the task of further sinking withthe primitive means of pick, spade, and windlass, the only appliancesused, becomes at this point somewhat difficult, and the men, knowing thevalue of the shallower levels, prefer spending their energies on anothershaft in fresh country. The matrix in which the gem is found consists ofa hard silicious conglomeration, usually thickly impregnated withironstone. The opal is embedded in this material in the form of thinsheets, which, however large they may be while in the formation, canonly be removed in divisions of about the size of a five shilling piece.Opal is of all colours and shades, but unfortunately for the miner apiece of exquisitely coloured blue, green, or red stone is consideredabsolutely valueless if not accompanied with the vivid scintillatingflash which denotes its "lifeness." Tons upon tons of this worthlessstuff, "Potch," as it is called, are daily thrown out of the shafts bydisgusted opallers, for in common with most things in this world, thebad is very plentiful, in fact it is almost impossible to get away fromit; but the gem or "live" opal is correspondingly rare. Nevertheless,fortunes are frequently made here by the merest chance, and perhaps toa greater degree than elsewhere is a man justified by results inbelieving that some day he will "send his pick through a fortune." Assaid before, the miners are of nearly all the races of mankind, and manyincongruous partnerships are formed for the holding and working of atwo, three, or four men's claim; but on the whole, good fellowship rulesthroughout the camps, and an American negro, a half-caste Chinaman, or aTurk, stands by the windlass of a canny Scot, a Frenchman, or a Hindu.There are no disputes between capital and labour in White Cliffs, everyman is his own master, and follows out his own usually erraticinclinations, unless sometimes when, after a lucky find, he imbibes toomuch of a certain commodity falsely-labelled Scotch, and consequentlythe police exercise a slight control over his movements.There are no surface indications to guide one in searching for opal, andas the most experienced "gouger" knows no more where the gem may be thanthe latest new chum, all work is done on chance. To such a strange stateof mind has the desert environment reduced those men of the back-blocks,that they look upon the grim side of circumstances with indifference,and magnify the trivialities of life into a proportion which to thestranger suggests a land of Burlesque. But soon he, too, catches themysterious infection, unconsciously he is overwhelmed by the influenceof his surroundings, and he ceases to see anything remarkable either inhis own doings or in those of his fellows. An observer, while heretained his own mental equilibrium, might see instances of this strangeperversion in almost every man in White Cliffs; but, perhaps, my ownexperiences there may serve to give some fair examples.My claim was staked about a mile from the town on a small stretch ofrising ground which at some time in the Earth's history formed the banksof the lake, in the old bed of which White Cliffs now stands. Forcomrades I had a powerful Scotsman and two Australians, while the claimsaround us were worked by an American and a native of Mauritius, known asBlack George, a German and an Englishman--the latter being termed the"Parson," a New Zealander and a Swede, and several other single miners,the chief being one called Satan. We were all good friends, and nightlygathered round a common camp-fire to discuss things in general.Silent Ted and Emu Bill, my two Australian comrades, were perhaps themost experienced prospectors on the field; the one had a very thoughtfulcast of countenance, and never spoke, and the other was a splendidspecimen of the Australian pioneer, but when he spoke it was chiefly inshort, crisp words, of decided colonial origin, which Mac said wouldhave qualified him "A1 for the position of a Clyde stevedore." Togetherthey had crossed the divide between the Darling River and Cooper'sCreek, and occasionally, when the moon was full, and the Southern Crossdipping behind the Great Barrier Ranges, Bill would tell of a land wherefire-flashing opal burst through the surface sands, and shone indazzling streaks of every imaginable colour from every wind-swept ledge.Ted would eagerly follow his comrade's words, and his wonderful facewould light up with genuine admiration when Bill's word-pictures werepowerfully descriptive. But he was too sympathetic, and frequently,alas! got into trouble because of that."Shut up, Ted!" Bill would suddenly cry, pausing in the middle of hisnarrative. "Is it you that's tellin' this yarn or me?"At these rough words the silent one would slowly turn a reproachfulglance upon the speaker which said as plainly as words, "Why, Bill, Idid not speak.""I knows that," would come the unhesitating answer, "but your face does,an' it's been an' got to the end of this story afore me."This was in a manner true, and sometimes when Bill, as Hoskins theAmerican said, was "long-winded in getting to the point," we had but tolook at Ted's face for the _dénoûement_."But how vas it you came away unt leave all dat opal? There must bemillions there," our German friend would say when Bill's narrative wasconcluded."I reckon there is, Kaiser," the _raconteur_ would answer, "but thecountry is full o' darned crows an' willy-willys, an' ye can't sleep nohow with the sand-flies an' snakes an' 'skeeturs. Water, did ye say? No,there ain't none."However much Ted and Bill may have ignored the absence of the preciousfluid, that was the only consideration with most of their listeners, andhad there been any water, some of us, at least, would have gone out Westat once and chanced everything else.One evening Bill was unusually eloquent in his discourse on thelavishness with which Nature had gifted the desert, and as all ourclaims had been yielding but poor returns for the last week or so, wepaid more attention to his words than we had been in the habit of doing."I wouldn't mind having a try out back," said Scottie, "if there were arailway, or if we had fleein' machines.""Couldn't we go as we are?" lisped the Parson, "we may work here forever, and not better ourselves."Bill gave vent to some sarcastic remarks anent the last speaker's powersof endurance, but otherwise made no comment.[Illustration: BORING FOR OPAL INDICATIONS.]"Bill says the surface is ironshot," continued the Parson blandly, "and,as I saw a team come into town to-day with about two dozen bicycles forsale, I thought----""Man, ye are a thinker, Parson," cried Scottie, "I'll gang away wi' yethe morn if ye like--that is if the machines are no ow'r dear.""I think we ought to get them, no matter what they cost," I remarked,"for if we do go out they would enable us to cross right over to theCooper at a pinch, if they did not break down, and the ground waspassable.""Well, I guess I am one of the crowd that goes," announced Hoskins."Unt me," cried the German."I reckon we is all going," said Bill, looking round the camp-fire forcorroboration. "Int you, Satan?""Of course I is," answered the individual addressed, acorrugated-skinned specimen of humanity. "I is goin' where Scottie an'the Parson goes; but where in tarnation is ye goin', and what for?""Cooper's Creek, for opal," roared Scottie."Opal," repeated Satan vacantly. Then his eyes kindled suddenly, and heexclaimed, "Lor', I forgot to tell ye, boys, I has been haulin' thestuff out by the sackful these last two weeks.""What!" yelled all in chorus, springing to their feet, and even thestoical Ted stopped in the act of lighting his pipe to gaze at Satan."It are a fact, mates," continued that gentleman apologetically, "Ireckon I has near got a waggon-load dumped out by now. Lor', what's theracket, mates?"Few heard his last words, for as the full literal import of what he hadjust said began to dawn on the assembly, a stampede took place down thehill towards the shaft; but another surprise was in store. While somewere rummaging in Black George's tent for candles to explore the longdrive in Satan's claim, and others were sliding down his windlass rope,a series of sounds broke out round our deserted fire, the fervour ofwhich made Hoskins say, "Hallo, boys, how is Bill not here?""I is here, darn ye!" came the muffled response from the darkness;"that's Ted that's shouting," which information made it clear to allthat Silent Ted in his excitement had placed the blazing mulga stump inhis mouth and thrown away his pipe.I had known Ted for a long time, but that was only the second occasionon which I had heard the sound of his voice. A few seconds later we hadcrowded into Satan's drive, and after crawling over a heap of mullockthat blocked the passage to within one foot of the roof, we foundourselves in the chamber where, from the presence of his pick and otherimplements, we knew he had recently been working. In a moment thecandles were lit, and then a cry of wonder burst from all. We werestanding in what might have been an Aladdin's palace, and the wallsdanced and flashed in the gloom as if alive. The roof was simply oneblaze of ever-changing orange and green, and through the whole woulddart spasmodically a "living" flash of fiery red. Clearly Satan hadstruck it, for there must have been several thousand pounds' worth ofopal exposed, whatever amount may have been hidden behind. Bill was thefirst to break the silence of admiration, which had fallen over all, andhe only said one word. It was characteristic and expressive, but quiteunprintable; and slowly we filed out again and clambered up the rope tothe surface. When we got back to our camp we found Ted, Satan, and theSwede sitting in silent meditation round the fire. Probably Ted wouldhave accompanied us, had it not been for the fact that he, being cook,had to look after a mysterious compound of flour and other substancescommonly known as damper, which every evening was prepared among theashes."Well, boy, you have struck it, an' no mistake," called out Ford, theNew Zealander, to Satan as we approached. "You're a millionaire now.""Get awa' frae this fire, you unceevilised heathen," roared Scottie, invirtuous indignation. "A man that wouldna' tell his mates when he strucka ton of opal is nae frien' o' mine; get awa' before a dae ye damage.""Come Scottie," began the Parson, but Mac would have none of him."Don't Scottie me," he bellowed, "Ye--ye----" Then seeing the look ofpain on the face of the would-be peacemaker he calmed down and said,"Weel, ye shouldna anger me. I'll alloo ony man to judge if----""Lor', Scottie, what is ye sayin'?" interrupted Satan anxiously; "Iforgot all about the darned stuff. I has no mate, and if you will comeand help spend it you can have the half.""Mein Gott," cried Kaiser, "I vil be your mate for von quarter.""Satan," began Mac, "A'm sorry A spoke, but A can see ye're no fit tobe left alane, among so mony Germans and foreign heathen. Sell yer opal,lad, and bank the money in Sydney. The coach leaves the morn's nicht.""I'll be darned if I do. I never went and left my mates yet, an' I ain'tgoin' to start now," exclaimed Satan doggedly.And then I explained that he had already done sufficient to merit ourblessing by discovering the layer of opal at the forty-four feet level."It in all probability extends throughout all our claims at that depth,"I said, "so you had better go down to Sydney and dispose of yours beforethe news leaks out. Otherwise there will be so much of the opal forsale locally when we all strike it that the buyers may be frightened."Ultimately we convinced Satan that he should go down to the coast, forit was evident he needed a change, and he could now well afford it.Shortly afterwards the party broke up for the night, and soon the campswere wrapt in slumber, each man dreaming, doubtless, of the opal hewould get on the morrow four feet beneath the floor of his lowest drive.In the morning the Parson, Kaiser, and Mac went over to assist Satan inworking out the opal showing in his claim, and in the evening hedeparted with twenty pounds weight of first-grade opal tied securely insacks so as to excite no suspicion. The news of the deep-level find soonspread, and at noon of the day following Satan's departure our littlecommunity was the centre of a "rush," which by evening had swelled intoa great canvas settlement stretching right across the white glisteninglake-bed towards the township.That evening our usual camp-fire circle was increased by the addition ofover a hundred hardened fortune-seekers eager to obtain any informationas to the levels, depths, and formations of the country, which,obviously, only we who had shafts already sunk were able to supply."It are the forty-four feet level seam we has struck," Bill answered toall inquiries, "an' it likely spreads out all over the flat there,though I 'spects it turns into Potch before it goes far.""I reckon we'll chance that," was the general response, and next day themany heaps of upturned sand that grew in proportion as we looked, showedthat the new arrivals were fast doing so.Meanwhile, the buyers were greatly agitated. They had heard exaggeratedreports concerning the find of the "forty-four," and had arranged amongthemselves to beat down the prices of the opal to £4 an ounce. It,therefore, surprised them to find the days passing and no one offeringto sell any opal; and one morning two of their fraternity repeggedSatan's abandoned claim, evidently with the intention of investigatingmatter for themselves. As we had been endeavouring by varioussubterfuges to keep this claim intact, some of us having even alteredour boundaries the better to do so, we were much chagrined at thisbrilliant move on their part, but marvelled how they had come to knowthat it was not legally manned. However, the claim was worked out, andas the two new holders knew as little about the practical part of miningfor opal as we knew of the value of the gem, we consoled ourselves withthe reflection that, after all, we might be able to turn their proximityto account.Thus it was that every evening a well-packed sack was carefully hoistedfrom each of the shafts of the surrounding claim-holders, and a rumourspread abroad that a new Sydney syndicate was buying opal by the ton.Our two Hebrew friends, by dint of persistent effort, graduallyinsinuated themselves into our good graces, and one day astonished us byannouncing that they were capitalists, and would purchase our claims ifthe terms were reasonable. At this straightforward way of doingbusiness, so foreign to the nature of their compatriots, I felt that wehad greatly wronged them, and as they said, truly enough, that they didnot know what our claims contained, and that their offer was merely apart of honest speculation, the Parson and I were much worried overcertain matters."I reckon I vote for selling," said Bill one evening as we held ameeting to consider the proposal. "The money will pay ex's for a tripWest, an' darn 'em! they're Jews anyhow.""A'm wi' ye, Bill," cried Mac, and one by one all signified theirapproval of the sentiments expressed until only the Parson and I wereleft."Of course I will not vote against my partner, Kaiser," began theParson, "but really there is nothing in our cl----" He stopped abruptly,for, from the shadows of our mullock-heap, stepped a stranger. Thereseemed something familiar about his gait as he crossed the fire-litzone, and sat down on the empty kerosene tin on which Satan used to sit,but I could not recollect whom he resembled. For a moment no one spoke;the stranger's amazing coolness had taken our breath away. He wasdressed in, presumably, the latest style of Sydney clothing, but even inthe dim light I could see that his garments hung loosely on his person.Evidently he had just arrived in White Cliffs, and had not yet been in awilly-willy (sand-storm)."Look here, ma man, hae ye a ticket?" said Mac at length."If ye is a new chum ye will get tucker in that tent there," said Bill,"but----""Lor', mates! What does ye mean? Doesn't ye not know me?" interruptedthe stranger. "I is Satan----""Golly! an' so it is, but--but where's your whiskers," cried BlackGeorge, holding a lighted match in the stranger's face."Satan, ye deevil, gie's yer hand," roared Scottie, "A'm rael glad tosee ye.""Oh, mates, I is glad to git back, I is," began our old friend. "Ihasn't had a proper feed since I left, an' I has been disgraced. I wentto a theatre in Sydney an' there was a fight on the stage, an' because Ijumped up an' jined in socially like, the police came in an' started onme. I couldn't fight them all, for there war' mor'n a dozen, an' nextday the judge, a very decent old gentleman, told me to git from Sydney,for it war' full o' sharks. I gitted to Melbourne, but, oh, Lor'! mates,don't none of you never go there----"[Illustration: THE BELLE OF THE BUSH.               A SALVATION ARMY CONVERT IN WHITE CLIFFS.]"But your opal, Satan? What did you get for it?" I broke in."Oh, that darned stuff? Mates, it weren't worth much after all. Therewar' two young fellows in the Wilcannia coach with me, an' they told methat it war' no good. They war' Jews of course; but they went down allthe way with me an' took me round all the buyers in Sydney, an' none o'them would look at it. I didn't know what to do; and I was mighty gladwhen the two Jews gave me two hundred pounds for the lot. I spent themoney as quick as I could, an' here I is back again, an'---- But has yegot no tucker?"For full five minutes the air was filled with the most powerful words inat least four different languages, during which entertainment Satanunconcernedly ate the piece of damper which Ted had handed to him."I suppose you do not remember the names of your two kind friends,Satan?" I said, passing him the tea billy."No, but they both wears a chain with a most 'culiar pendant, somethinglike what the Parson showed us one night.""Ah!" I cried. "Gentlemen, our business is settled. We will sell ourclaims to-morrow: we cannot refuse the kindly, disinterested offer ofSatan's two benefactors.""But I reckon the price has risen, hasn't it?" inquired Bill."Yes," answered the Parson grimly. "Satan's opal was worth £8,000."Next morning the two Hebrews came out from town a full hour earlier thanusual, and without more ado the Parson, as spokesman, informed themthat having considered everything and being desirous of going out West,we were willing to sell our joint claims for three thousand pounds incash."But two tousant was the agreement," remonstrated one."There was no agreement," replied the Parson. "Candidly I can't imaginewhy you wish to have the claims, for opal seems to have fallen in themarket, but if you still desire them that sum is our price until we hearfrom other possible purchasers."While he was speaking, Mac and Hoskins were assiduously painting theaddress of a famous Sydney firm of jewellers on a well-roped candle-box,and after eyeing them intently for a minute, Aaron ---- said--"Vell den, we don't cares, we is speculative business men. No, we do notwant to see your drives. Ha, ha! we vas not built to go throughrabbit-holes. Here is de money, sign this papers all of you, an' comeand dine with us in the Australian Thirst saloon."The above is the history of the finding of the "forty-four" feet level,and the selling of "Block 91." The money was equally divided among themen interested, after which most of them pegged out fresh claimselsewhere, but Bill, Ted, Satan, Black George, Scottie, the Parson, andI, procured bicycles and water-bags, and started off on our Westernprospecting trip that same afternoon. It is unnecessary to repeat thedetails of our journey. The country was at first a hard, sandy plaindotted here and there with sparse growths of the ubiquitous mulga scrub,and occasionally broken by outcrops of silver lodes; but as we advanced,all forms of vegetation disappeared, and on the third day we foundourselves on an undulating sea of ironshot sand bounded only by thehorizon. We had not as yet seen any signs of surface opal formations,and of course had no intention of sinking shafts to investigate, in theheart of such a desert. On the fourth day we calculated that we had nowreached a point one hundred and forty miles west from White Cliffs, andthat night we camped on the edge of a dry clay-pan and considered theadvisability of returning. Bill and Ted, however, persisted that we hadnot yet gone far enough to see the place of which they had spoken sooften, and although I could not understand how they had managed totravel such a distance, nor how they knew whether we had passed theirfarthest-out camp or not, I had implicit faith in the correctness oftheir observations."I reckon we has to go 'bout thirty miles yet. We was jest a day offhere," said Bill."You must have been quite close to Lake Frome then," I said."Never seed it, nor knowed of it, nor don't believe there ever was anylake in this part o' the world," replied Bill, and I wondered greatly,seeing that Lake Frome was distinctly marked across our path on theGovernment map in my possession. We had no fire that night, there beingnothing that would burn within at least a day's journey, andconsequently our supper was not of a tempting nature."Well, men, I don't know that I care to be responsible for taking youfurther west," I announced. "How much water is left in the bags?""There war' six gallons between them all after supper," answered Satan,"but Ted took a drink since then.""Let us try another day yet," advised the Parson, "we can go back overour tracks in two days, and the opal might only be an hour ahead."All expressed their approval of these remarks, so soon after, we scrapedthe top off the hard sand and went to sleep. The pests were unusuallyenergetic that night, and several times we were awakened by theirvoraciousness. The Parson and Black George seemed to be affected evenmore so than the others, but it must have been an exceptionally largeand active centipede that bit our dusky comrade in three places beforehe could discard his garments. At any rate, his yells aroused fourevil-eyed crows from their dreams of the gorge they expected to havesoon, and a skulking dingo also started in affright, emitting as itretreated a blood-curdling howl, that instantly brought us all to ourfeet."Lor'! nigger! Has ye not never been bit before?" cried Satan in areproving tone of voice, as he cast a sand-snake from under him."Who does ye expect can sleep with you on the corroborree, Nig? Darn it!An' you a black fellow too. I reckon you oughten 'pologise," grumbledBill.George's answer was picturesque, but three bleeding wounds on his backshowed where the venomous creature had got in its work on him. He was ahardy piece of humanity, however, and after the Parson had lanced therapid swelling flesh and applied ammonia, he went to sleep again.Shortly afterwards the Parson himself rose to his feet with anexclamation of annoyance, and began kicking up his sandy sleeping place."What's wrong?" I inquired."I don't know. There seems to be a boulder or something hard under me.Hallo! What's this--Great Scott! Opal!"Again the party sprang up, and as the glistening stone was rolled out onthe surface and examined by match-light, many and various were thecomments made on the poor Parson's ignorance, for the boulder which hadsought out the soft corners of his body was a mass of green coppersulphide."And has this material no value?" asked the object of the unkindremarks."None; it's worse than potch," roared Bill. "See, Scottie's got more.Lor'! it's everywhere.""It is really worth a considerable amount," I said, "but the expense oftreating it properly out here would be too much for us. That is anoutcrop, and to all appearance it is one of the richest everdiscovered."We slept no more that night, and before sunrise started off across theclay-pan. The surface was smooth and hard, and with the aid of a slightbreeze which arose with the sun we skimmed along at an almost incrediblepace."Hallo, Ted! There's our old stakes," suddenly yelled Bill, steering forthe crest of a broken piece of ground, and following in his tracks, wesoon were standing round a broken pick-handle standing upright in theground and on which was inscribed: "C.B. and S.T. Pros. Claim. CornerPeg.""How on earth did you manage to lead us here, Bill?" cried the Parsonwonderingly."Easy enough; this is the same season as when we were out, so we jestran the ole sun down an' at night ye can always git the bearin's fromthe Cross."The Parson's surprise might have been greater had he known that mycompass had been useless since the second day out, and that but for afew haphazard observations taken, Bill had been our only guide.Meanwhile Ted had unstrapped a pick and set to work, and before I hadfully realised that we stood on what--in the rainy season, if such aseason existed in those parts--was an island in the centre of LakeFrome, and that it was its salt-encrusted bed we had been crossing sincemorning, he handed me a piece of some scintillating substance,inquiring, by the shape of his face, my opinion as to its value."Why, that's opalised wood," I exclaimed. "But what have we struck now?""The opal we told ye about, of course," grunted Bill. "The sand's blownover it, and Ted's dug it up again; that's all."Truly we had encountered a marvellous formation. Great masses of fieryand orange opal were uncovered on every side, and for a day we didnothing but gather the best. It was evident that a forest had at onetime occupied the site of the lake, for most of the opal showed thegrains of wood throughout its structure, and many opalised leaves werefound embedded in a matrix which looked uncommonly like bark. Thislatter fact was most puzzling, for the trees with bark in Australia arefew indeed. We pegged out seven prospector's claims, and after a finallook round prepared to move, our intention being to arrange for suitabletransport for stores and water, and then come back."Ye talk about the effeeciency o' the steam engine," muttered Scottie,as he examined the liquid contents of our bags, "but it's far oot o'date now, for we've each got to run a hundred miles a day on a pint o'water, and if onything can beat this----""No doubt your remarks are the result of much study, Mac," I said,working out an elaborate calculation on the sand, "but we are not morethan ninety miles from civilisation straight ahead, and if we care totravel over what remains of the lake by moonlight and the groundcontinues passable after that, we will strike the South Australianrailway somewhere near Beltana siding to-morrow afternoon."And so it proved. We reached the S.A. line on the following afternoon,and an hour after sundown stopped the Port Augusta-bound train bykindling a fire in the middle of the track. Thirty-six hours later wefound ourselves parading Rundle Street, Adelaide, in quest of some ofScottie's friends who resided there.[Illustration: THE DINGOE OR NATIVE DOG.]A week later I was in Sydney, and while crossing on the _Kirribilli_from Circular Quay to Milsons Point I came face to face with Aaron----."How vas you?" he cried effusively."As usual," I replied. "How are the claims turning out?""Oh, not too bad," he answered, but his flushed face told another story;"but tell me," he continued, "who vas it bought your opal in Sydney?""No one. We sent no opal to Sydney.""But the boxes and sacks----?""Were filled with potch.""An'--an' the forty-four feet level is--but ah! you make mistake; Ibought five tousant pound of its opal before I saw you.""Yes, I know, but you bought all that ever came from that depth. It wasmerely a pocket; we discovered that much two days after Satan, your oldfriend, left White Cliffs. It was in his claim, probably because ithappened to be the lowest lying. We might not have sold our claims toyou but for the fact that Satan returned, and--well, you know twohundred pounds is not fair value for five thousand."Aaron's rage was great, but he afterwards paid six hundred sovereignsfor the opal we had brought down from Lake Frome. We did not go backthere, a shower of rain came on and flooded the lake, and after chasingthe elusive gem over the greater part of Queensland with more or lesssuccess, our party reformed and set out on a gold-prospecting trip toBritish New Guinea.PROSPECTING IN BRITISH NEW GUINEAThe life of the prospector in New Guinea is not fraught with manypleasures, but in my experience, oftener than elsewhere, he enjoys thatexquisite sensation which attends the unexpected finding of gold, andhere the dreary monotony of life in the Australian interior is exchangedfor conditions more congenial to his wandering nature.British New Guinea is to most people the least-known part of our empire;but there are few valleys in its dark interior in which the prospectorhas not "chipped" some quartz formation, or "panned" some sand from theriver's bed. The British flag was first planted in Eastern New Guinea byCaptain, now Admiral, John Moresby, of H.M.S. _Basilisk_, in 1872. Thisofficer, whilst employed in superintending the pearl shell fisheries inTorres Straits, learnt that adventurers, both American and French, werecontemplating expeditions and occupation of the then unknown shores ofEastern New Guinea.The captain of the _Basilisk_, being aware of the great strategicalimportance of these coasts to Australia, resolved to forestall any suchattempt, and fortunately succeeded in securing for England the whole ofEastern New Guinea and its adjacent islands. Ultimately, however, alarge part of his labour was lost owing to the retrograde policy of thetimes, when Germany was allowed to seize so considerable a part ofNorth-Eastern New Guinea without opposition.Samarai has now eclipsed Port Moresby as the chief port of thepossession. It is built, or rather erected, upon a small island at theextreme south-east of the mainland, and is in direct communication withCooktown in Queensland and the Australian capitals. From Samaraicoasting-steamers run regularly to the mouths of the Mambare, Kumusi,and Gira rivers on the northeastern coast, and in the upper reaches andsources of these rivers are the great gold deposits, the origin of whichhas completely baffled the mineralogist and geologist to explain. Themen there do not trouble themselves as to its origin, however, and whilethe river-beds continue to yield a sure and steady quantity of gold tothe ordinary miner, and the mountain gorges or creeks providesensational "finds" for the more daring prospector, no one cares whetherthe presence of the precious metal is in accordance with the views ofgeologists or otherwise."It is a fact that the bottom is on top," said an old pioneer. "But thenthe outcrops are all inside the darned mountains, so we are quits."The township of Tamata is the most important centre of the New Guineangoldfields, but the Yodda Valley camp rivals it closely, and it isexpected that some of the new camps at the base of Mount Albert Edwardwill in time surpass them both. The fierce, unreasoning hostility of thenatives renders prospecting at any distance from the settlements anextremely dangerous occupation, as the writer, who has had severalexperiences among the cannibalistic tribes of the lower ranges, cantestify. As a rule, however, the prospector scorns all such dangers,and if he escapes the dreaded fever, trusts to his rifle for protectionand his luck for fortune, and straightway proceeds to cut a path intosome unknown river valley.The famous Yodda Valley, where men at first made fifty ounces of gold(equivalent to £180 per day), was discovered in such manner, and if thestories of some of the prospecting parties who crossed New Guinea in alldirections were given to the world, doubtless a "rush" would set intowards the deadly fever-swamps, unparalleled in the world's historyboth for its general extent and the amount of victims. Round thecampfires at night, enveloped in their smoke to escape the many pests,the men of the various settlements regularly gather to discuss thelatest news from the coast, and to consider the many strange reports of"great strikes" constantly circulated by the friendly natives.Frequently a party is organised to go and prove the truth of any suchreport, and when in turn word is sent back that the chances are good, ageneral exodus often takes place, all setting out for the new fieldswith light hearts and high hopes.Miners cannot stay in New Guinea for more than one season at a time;they are forced by repeated attacks of the various fevers to leave theirwork and take a "spell" in the southern parts of Australia or NewZealand. In my opinion lack of proper food is the prime cause of thesefevers, as it is only when the men are "run down" that the kuri-kuribreaks out among them. The stores are floated as far as possible up therivers in oil-launches and whale-boats, and then transported overland tothe camps by native carriers in the employment of the diggers. Themajority of the miners are Australians; but in most prospecting partiesthere is usually a Scotsman and an Irishman, and not infrequently aGerman.In the party with which I was associated there were two typicalAustralian prospectors, one German, one Irishman, and, including myself,two Scots. We also had six native carriers and two dogs. My Scottishcomrade said that "the dugs were as guid as ony twa men"; but howeverthat might apply to the whites, it was at least unfair to our dusky"boys," who were Fly River natives, and only cost one shilling each forwages per day. We all had had experience on other goldfields, and eachman was fever-proof, which in New Guinea means impregnated with quinine."Doc," the Irishman, was a Dublin University man of some repute. He hadbeen in turn a member of a famous North Polar expedition, and an officerin the American Philippino campaign. Mac had been everywhere, but hisaccent seemed to become more pronounced the farther from home hewandered. The two Australians, Emu Bill and Starvation Sam, were goodspecimens of the wandering Anglo-Saxon. Bill was one of the pioneers ofCoolgardie, but if he were addressed by his real name, William Hambley,he would probably not recognise it. Sam was the son of a governor of anot unknown "'link' in our chain of Empire"; but as he adopted hiscognomen to hide his identity, and no one would dream of calling himanything else, perhaps I will be excused from going further into hisfamily history. He was six feet five inches in height, had been in histime soldier, sailor, missionary, pearler, outlaw, and mail-carrier,from which description all Queenslanders and South Sea travellers willimmediately recognise him. Our German companion was a first-classmineralogist and an excellent comrade--and cook; but he deeply resentedthe appellation of Kaiser, which Mac bestowed upon him."I am not Cherman," he would say. "I vas been as mooch English as you,Scodie.""A ken that fine, Kaiser," Mac would answer. "A'm Scotch frae Dundee."We left Tamata with the intention of prospecting the Owen Stanleyranges, and among the miners in general were considered to be the mostexperienced and best-equipped prospecting party that ever essayed thatventure. Our journey for the first week was, allowing for the nature ofthe country--uneventful. A crocodile gripped one of our carriers whilecrossing the Ope River, but making a combined attack on the hugesaurian, we forced it to relax its hold, and finally, as Bill remarked,"Ther' war one inseck less in the darned country." Another day we wereattacked by myriads of bees, and, despite our face-nets, they inflictedmuch pain upon all. The New Guinean bee does not sting, in the strictestsense of the word; it has an intense craving for salt, and, obeying someinstinct, it fastens into the skin and raises great blisters thereon byits peculiar suction action. At lunch-time we carefully made a pile ofdry brushwood, and shook a small packet of salt over it. Instantly thebees left us and followed the salt down through the loose heap, and thenwith a chuckle of delight, and a grunt of satisfaction from Kaiser, Macapplied a lighted match. Doc said that Mac chased the only bee thatescaped for over half a mile, but at any rate we were not troubledfurther that day.Continuing our journey, which at first had been through the swampy andpestilential morass formed by the Ope River's periodical overflow, we atlength crossed the "divide" between the Ope and Kumusi waters, andtravelled through a country in which brilliantly-hued creepers blazedfrom the tree-tops, and luxuriant vegetation flourished everywhere.Gaudy-plumaged parrots, cockatoos, and birds of paradise flittedoverhead, making the forest resound with their deafening chatter.Snakes of nearly all varieties started from the dense under-growths aswe approached, and our dogs had plenty of exercise in chasing theseundesirables. They in turn were the hunted when near rivers, and many anarrow escape Mac and his charges had from the enormous and impregnablecrocodiles that infested the banks of all streams.[Illustration: CROCODILE'S JAWS.]There were several native villages in the district which we nowtraversed, but having had previous experience of the treacherous natureand cannibalistic proclivities of most of the tribes in that quarter, weavoided them, and altered our course when we struck a native pad ortrack. We knew that our tracks must be seen, however, and nightlyexpected a visit from the warriors, who, fearing only the Governmentpolice, looked upon prospecting parties as the lawful prey allowed themby a considerate Government. We were not disappointed. One night, whencamped near the Kumusi, and about thirty miles from the Yodda Valleycamps, the long-expected attack came, and, to Mac's intense disgust, wedid not stay to argue the point, but departed hurriedly andignominiously. Two days later we reached the Yodda, and camped for sometime, to try our luck and hear the latest reports from the mountains. Aday previous to our arrival a strong party had set out to prospect MountScratchley, and while we were camped a famous pioneering company arrivedfrom the interior, and reported the discovery of vast gold deposits inthe gullies of the higher ranges. Several of the members showed somepeculiar stones which they had taken from the mountain ravines, and oneveteran, in whom Sam recognised an old comrade, hinted mysteriously thatthe nuggets and slugs which they had with them came from a lava depositat the source of the Gira, in German territory. While Doc and I notedthat significant fact for future reference, Kaiser was more interestedin the stones."Dat is vat is called zircon," he whispered to me, as he placed a pebbleon his tongue. "Gott! it is over twenty carats," he continued excitedly."Ask him ver it vas come from.""Why not ask him yourself?" I suggested jokingly, but the reproachfullook he gave me made me regret that I had spoken. Kaiser's race, in mostBritish colonies, is always suspected of underhand dealing. On myinquiring of the owner where he had found the stones, he placed them inmy hands."In some creeks in the back ranges," he answered. "You can have themall. I ain't going to carry them further.""But look," I said, chipping the edge of one, and disclosing atranslucent mass of pale straw colour, in which a tinge of port winedanced according to the manner in which the stone was held."I don't care," he replied. "I is a gold-miner, an' I knows that everyounce of gold is worth £3 17s. 6d.; but that is darned stuff only Jewswill buy, and I'll throw them away if you don't want them."I had no spare money--the prospector never has--and as he refused totake a new Winchester rifle and my silver-mounted revolver, I did notknow what to give him in return."Ye'll need all yer pop-guns where ye are goin'," he said. "I is goingdown to South Aus. with my pile; but say, if ye has any fruit-salt, orsugar, or quinine to spare, I an' the boys would be ontarnally obligedto ye."I gave him a bottle of quinine tabloids, and another of saccharine, and,as few of the miners had ever heard of the latter substance, and ofcourse seldom carried sugar, their delight was a treat to see. Weentertained them to dinner, and next morning they started for theKumusi River, _en route_ for the coast, Samarai, and Australia. At thesame time we picked up their old tracks and steered for the distant peakof Mount Scratchley.Our progress was now necessarily slow, for, in addition to being in ahostile country, through which Sir William Macgregor and his nativepolice was the only armed force that had ever passed, we had to carry onprospecting operations. Three days out, our first "strike" was made. Webridged a deep river in the usual manner, by felling a tree across frombank to bank, and after we had crossed, Kaiser, who was an enthusiasticbotanist, descended into the channel to examine a curious growth on anunder branch."Come on, Kaiser," shouted Mac; "there's nae gold doon there.""Bring up a sample, anyhow," Bill added, throwing him a gold-pan; andlaughingly we all passed on, leaving our inquisitive comrade to followat his leisure. Shortly afterwards Doc shot a wild pig, and, as allprospectors adopt the rule of dining when opportunity offers, a halt wascalled for that purpose. During cooking operations Kaiser arrived,carrying Bill's gold-pan. Bill took the dish from his hands with theintention of replacing it in its former position on a carrier's back;but, to his loudly and vigorously expressed astonishment, he found thathis comrade had followed his instructions, and actually carried abouttwo pounds of sand from the river's bed."Lor', but ye is green, Kaiser!" he remarked, preparing to throw thesand out."Haud on a wee," Mac cried, seizing his arm; "it's aye whaur ye dinnaexpect to find gold that ye get it. Noo, I dinna think there's onythere, so try it."Bill looked at Mac in thoughtful silence for a minute."I reckon it's worth trying, anyhow," cried Sam. "Pitch it here, an'I'll pan it."Bill did so, and Sam walked over to a creek near. Shortly after we wereall startled by his shout. "Did you salt" (add gold to) "this dirt,Scottie?" he roared."Get oot, man, an' no mak' a fool o' yersel'!" Mac answered, walkingover. "Hallo! Come here lads," he continued; "we've struck it!"In a moment six excited men were round the pan, to which Sam was stillimparting a gentle concentric motion, and, to our unbounded amazement,every movement of the dish still increased the comet-like tail of deepred gold in the ripple of the pan."Well, I'll be jiggered!" said the two Australians simultaneously."I'll be d--darned!" remarked Mac, with great feeling."Mine Gott! Tree ounce stuff!" cried Kaiser."Better come and have dinner," suggested Doc.I do not remember what I said; but even our "boys" babbled away inunintelligible but excited language. Of course we returned to theriver--one of the Kumusi head-waters--and by sundown had tested thesands at various points for a distance of two miles on both sides of ourbridge. Kaiser, meanwhile, had set to work with his pan, and when wereturned to our camping-ground he had about half an ounce of coarse goldto show for his efforts.Next day we pegged out six prospectors' claims along both banks of thestream, including, of course, as much of the alluvial land on eitherside as our claims would allow. For several days afterwards we devotedsome time to the most promising bars and deposits; but, as we hadneither the tools nor the material for constructing sluice-boxes, ourmethods were restricted to simply washing the "dirt" in our pans. Onthe fourth day Mac threw down his pan, ejaculating at the same time themost-used word in his fairly-extensive vocabulary."What is the matter, Mac?" I cried, from the opposite bank."I dinna see hoo I shood hae tae work like a Clyde steevedore," heanswered, "when ony man wi' the sma'est scienteefic abeelities could getas much gold in hauf an hoor as the lot o' us can in a day.""Explain, Mac. Have you an idea?""Ay, thousands o' them. But what's tae hinder us frae taking a wheensplit bamboos an' stringing them thegether like a sheet o' galvanisediron----""Nothing. We have our axes. But what----?""Turn the affair upside down and lean it against the bank there. Some o'us could throw the sand on tae the thing and Kaiser could keep it goin'wi' enough water tae wash the sand awa.'""But the bamboo is too smooth. The gold would be carried over the edgeswith the sand.""Pit a hale bamboo in atween every twa split yins, an' if the gold couldrise ow'r that it wad be too licht for savin' ony way.""All right, Mac," I responded. "You make the affair, and if it works wewill appoint you our chief engineer."Mac did not answer. He knew that all his appointments merely meant somuch additional work left to him as a matter of course; and even asthings were, he never had "ony time for meeditaishun." He made hiscorrugated inclined plane, however, and as all his comrades, exceptingKaiser, laughed at his idea, he worked it himself for the first day.That evening, as we sat in the smoke of our camp-fire, Doc remarked,"Well, boys, I made about an ounce to-day, but I can't say that I caremuch about the work.""I reckon I is good for an ounce too," said Bill.Sam was cook, Kaiser camp-guard, and I had been writing up my log, so wehad nothing to say. Mac evidently--like an Australian bushman--believedthat silence was golden, for it was only after being asked several timesthat he spoke. "Ah, weel," he said reflectively, "there's some folk inthis weary world content tae work awa' frae morn till nicht for a paltrythree pounds seventeen an' saxpence worth" (one ounce of gold), "but I'mno ane o' them.""Mac is home-sick," Doc laughed."Has your patent turned out a duffer?" inquired Sam."I reckon Scottie is keeping back his gold from his mates," said Billaggrievedly."How much did you get, Mac?" I interrupted soothingly, for Mac had beenmy companion in many a journey, and I understood his nature well."I dinna ken," he answered, handing me a fair-sized pouch; "aboot hauf apun', I think.""What!" roared the men, springing to their feet."Lor, Scottie! Does ye mean----?""Eight ounces exactly," I announced. "Mac has made £30 for one day'swork.""Scodland for ever!" shouted Kaiser from the midst of a cloud of nativetobacco-smoke, and the others echoed his sentiments. Next day all handsassisted at Mac's machine, which showed in its construction many signsof that gentleman's ingenuity; but it had not been designed to bear thestrain now put upon it, and after a few hours' work the bamboo ripplesfell away. However it may apply in other circumstances, it is arecognised law among prospectors that misfortunes never come singly,therefore we were not surprised that afternoon when the river suddenlycame down "a banker" (in flood) and carried away all our preparationsfor a new machine. Doc, who was of a philosophical nature, went outshooting when it became apparent that no further work could be done thatday. When he returned to camp I saw from his face that the last of ourmisfortunes had not yet been reached."The Papangis and Babagas are out," he said quietly."That means----?" I said."That we'd better git, quick an' lively too," interrupted Bill."This creek runs into a large river about three miles down," continuedDoc, "and there is a palisaded village near the junction. I saw somecanoes drawn up on the banks, and from their design and peculiarornamentation I at once guessed who their owners were. There were alsosome bearing the symbol of the Sizuretas; but probably they were thosetaken from that tribe when the great massacre occurred. I did not seeany natives, and as I was quite close to the palisades I thereforeconcluded that they did not wish to be seen, and you can all guess whatthat means."Doc's words caused great consternation, and when our "boys" gatheredthat they were in the country of the dreaded Papangi they set up awailing. "Papangi no good. Hims eat poor black devils. Stick head onpouri dubus" (sorcerer's house), cried one, on whom we had bestowed thetitle of King George."Dinna you be frichtened, ma man," said Mac consolingly. "If ony o' thePapangi heathens come near enough I'll gie them sic a feed o' lead thattheir ghosts'll hae indegeestion." King George did not understand allthat Mac said; but he brightened up considerably at his words, and atonce began to infuse spirit into his companions. Mac was alwaysdelighted at the prospect of a fight; but as these tribes had only amonth previously murdered and eaten most of the inhabitants ofAngerita, the chief village of the Sizuretas, and afterwardssuccessfully given battle to the Warden of the Northern Division and hispolice, who had gone to punish them, we thought discretion the betterpart of valour, and prepared to move, much to Mac's disgust."Are ye gaun to rin awa' again?" he bellowed indignantly. "Let's get magun, an I'll gang an' fecht them ma'sel.""An' your head vas look vell on pole-top, Scottie," said Kaiser as hestruck our tent."We will fight if we can get a good camping-ground where they can't getbehind us," I said, and with that Mac had to be content.In a marvellously short space of time our carriers were loaded andacross the stream, after which we cast our bridge adrift and started upthe north bank, intending to follow the river to its source, and thenprospect for the lode from which the gold was shed. The sun had justdisappeared as we began our march. We had not stayed for supper, andperhaps this fact had something to do with the depressing influence thatseemed to rest upon all. Animal life had suddenly become very active;and to feel a coiling, writhing object among the feet, or to tread uponsome nameless amphibious creature, was anything but a pleasantsensation.The moon shone brightly for the first two hours, and we travelled muchfaster than is usual in New Guinea. Our dogs, however, seemed consciousof some impending danger that was not yet apparent to us; and it grievedMac sorely to see how his dumb charges hung so closely to his person,and how spiritless they had become."I fancy we should have stayed and risked a fight," Doc said at length,as we paused at the mouth of a narrow ravine through which the streamrushed furiously. "Our boys will never face that.""Can't we get over the top?" I suggested; but Bill and Sam, who had beenreconnoitring, said our only possible course was to traverse the streamand trust to there being no pools. This prospect was not very pleasing.We did not know the length of the ravine, nor what animals might havetheir homes in its depths, and our nerves were already at high tension.The moon was now obscured with banks of dark clouds that had suddenlyshot up from beneath Mount Victoria, and the birds of night, before sonoisy, were now strangely silent. The atmosphere had also becomeoppressively close, and we had to throw down our loads, from sheerphysical inability to longer sustain them."It's a 'buster' comin'," Sam gasped; "git up the flies--quick!" A flashof lightning lit up the valley as he spoke, and a terrific thunder-clapreverberated through the ravine. A minute of what felt unnatural silencepassed, during which we all struggled with our long canvas "fly," andthen the storm burst. We had got our flour-and rice-sacks under cover,and following Kaiser's example, crawled in under the folds beside them.The rain was the heaviest I have ever experienced, and soon we weredrenched to the skin, even through the thick canvas. Suddenly one of thedogs started up, and instinctively fearing some new calamity, I grippedhis nostrils tightly, while Doc crawled to the edge of our covering."It's them," he whispered. "They are on the other bank; Heaven help usif we are discovered!""Let me oot!" growled Mac; "I'm no gaun to be speared like a rabbit in ahole.""Shut up, Mac," I remonstrated. "It's too dark for them to see, and theycannot cross the water in any case." The patter of feet could now beheard on the opposite bank, and an occasional Che-ep (battle-cry)showed that we were not mistaken. In this new excitement we soon forgotour miserable condition; and from the characteristic behaviour of theindividual members of the party, it was evident that the actual presenceof danger had dispelled the strange feeling of depression whichpreviously had almost unnerved us. Mac was muttering to his dogs, Billand Sam were--unconsciously, I believe--pouring out a torrent ofAustralian bush words which, as Kaiser afterwards said, "sounded likepoedry." Kaiser himself, I knew, was munching a piece of damper, whichwith thoughtful precaution he had carried from our last camp. Our boyslay still, as if asleep. I was so engrossed in the study of my comradesthat events outside passed unnoticed until Doc's voice startled us."Come out, boys!" he cried; "all is clear." We crawled from under oursoaked covering, and found Doc puffing at his pipe as serenely as if hehad just risen from supper. The storm had ceased, the moon was shiningagain, and the dark clouds were speeding towards the Yodda Valley."Evidently our friends were surprised by the 'buster' as much as wewere," Doc said; "at any rate, they have gone home to dine on somethingelse.""That minds me that I'm hungry tae," cried Mac; "come on, Kaiser; gi'eus a haun.'"By some miraculous means these two worthies got a fire kindled, andwhile we dried ourselves by the blaze of the gum-logs, the "billies"were boiled, and soon some copious draughts of thick black tea made usfeel quite recovered. When morning came the waters in the gorge hadsubsided, and after a hasty breakfast we forced a passage up the stream,and finally emerged on the wooded slopes of the mountains.The details of our journey from thence onwards would require too muchspace to enumerate. We steered for the distant ranges, because wewished to prospect them before the state of our stores rendered thatimpossible, knowing that, if unlucky, we could always come back to thesands of the river. We were attacked twice by hunting tribes of whatmust have been the notorious Tugeris; but we were no longer inclined torun away, and for the benefit of the gold-seeker who might come afterus, we taught them that it was dangerous to interfere with prospectors.One day in the middle ranges we traced up a rich gold formation, and bythe primitive method of dollying with improvised tools obtained 110ounces from it in three days. In this region--near the source of theGira--signs of gold were everywhere; but we were not equipped forsystematic mining, and could only treat the rich free ore or thealluvial deposits. There seemed to be few natives here, and owing to theheight above sea-level the country was much healthier than in the lowervalleys. One day we came on a deserted village, in the stockaded gardenof which were cocoanut and betel palms, and the usual taro andsweet-potatoes. The sugar-cane and tobacco-plant were also much inevidence, showing that some civilising influence--probably that of themissionaries--had been at work among the former inhabitants. We saw nosign of life, however, and therefore concluded that the fierce Tugerishad recently raided the place.Another day Doc and I, while climbing up the mountain-side from ourcamp, found our progress suddenly barred by a steep gully that cuttransversely along the slope. Descending with difficulty into thevalley, and following up the course of an old water-channel, we found aheterogeneous deposit of zircons, sapphires, topazes, and many othergemstones amidst the _débris_ of an extinct blowhole. We gathered someof what appeared to be the best, intending to find out their value atthe earliest possible opportunity. The valley formation itself wouldhave gladdened the heart of any geologist; from any point lower down themountain the slope seemed continuous, and only when at the edge of the"breakaway" was the valley evident.We were now near the German boundary, and hesitated between our desiresand our duty as law-abiding prospectors. While camped on doubtfulterritory an incident occurred that may serve to illustrate more thanone thing. We were satisfied with our luck so far; and thereforelight-hearted, so much so that one night Mac began to sing, and soon weall joined him. The air was very clear on the mountains, but it struckme that the echoes lingered strangely; and after we had turned in forthe night, volumes of sound still rose and fell on the atmosphere,sweeter far than that produced by our own rough voices. Next night, aswe sat at supper regarding ruefully our fast-diminishing stores, we werestartled by a loud "Hallo!" "Hallo!" we shouted back, and then to ourastonishment four men and six carriers marched into our fire-lit circle."It's a graun' nicht," cried one. "Hae ye onything for eatin'?""Well, I'll be--Scotched!" remarked Doc, while Mac sprang to his feetand stared at the new-comers."You are just in time," I said. "What clan do you represent?""Macpherson; A'm frae Laggan-side. Sandy here is a Glesga man, but Boban' Jim are Englishmen; they're nane the waur o' that----""We heard you singing last night," interrupted Bob. "We are as hungry ashawks--but how is the war?"...The new party had just come from a protracted trip in German territory,and they told many strange tales of what they had seen in thatmysterious land. Unfortunately their stores had given out, and oninvestigation we found that ours could not last more than ten days forboth parties. However, as Mr. Robert Elliot informed me, they had madeenough gold to warrant their going back again; and, pendingconsiderations as to the advisability of our joining forces, we allresolved to have a "spell."We eventually reached the coast at Holnecote Bay; a week after we landedat Samarai, and eight days more found us in Sydney.Here two Hebrew gentlemen offered Sam and Kaiser a £10 note for ourentire stock of gem-stones. In consequence of this generous offer (!)and the fact that his great height afforded an easy means ofidentification, we had to send Sam rather hurriedly to Melbourne. Weeventually restored peace, however, by selling our stones to theafore-mentioned individuals for £80; and since then Aaron K. hasinformed me that one stone alone, when cut into four parts and polished,fetched fifty-three sovereigns.IN THE GUM-LAND OF WANGERIThere is a region away in the far north of New Zealand, where sooner orlater the wanderer who knows the world by the track of his footstepsmust surely gravitate, there to mingle with kindred spirits and pursuethe even tenor of life's way for a brief space under tranquilcircumstances, digging for the Kauri-resin deposits of former ages alongthe fern swamps and uplands, amassing wealth if fortune favours, butcasually content with the generous subsistence his peaceful labours atthe least will bring, until his restless nature compels him to journeyforth again on his ceaseless pilgrimage.My acquaintance with this odd corner of the globe was made some yearsago, when chance--fatality, the gum-diggers would call it--led me totake a trip on a coasting steamer trading from Auckland northwards. Ihad never heard of the gum-digging industry except in the vaguest way,and curiosity had fired my interest in inverse ratio with the amount ofinformation gathered. But I could not help noticing that all myinquiries on the subject were treated with scantily hidden disapproval,and in consequence I never pressed my apparently awkward questions,fearing that I had by accident hit on a conversational topic, which,like that of convict history in Australia, had best be tabooed. So ithappened that when the SS. _Bulimba_ moored alongside the jetty in thebeautiful harbour of Wangeri, I stepped ashore, meaning to put in a dayor so in the picturesque little township which looked so alluring fromthe water, yet wholly unaware of the fact that I had at last reached thecentre of the gum country. That was a small matter, however, on which Iwas speedily enlightened.I had just got clear of the long wharf, and was looking about the quietstreet in which I found myself, in hopes of spying the hospitableportals of an hotel near at hand, when four extremely ragged men emergedfrom the doorway of the establishment I had at that moment decided topatronise. Their outward appearance was bad--very bad, and though I haveforegathered with all sorts and conditions in my time, I like to choosemy company when I can. I resolved promptly to pass on to some otherhouse. The disreputable quartette were now hurrying towards me, and Imoved aside to give them ample room to go by. Three of the party wereengaged in animated discussion; the fourth walked a little way ahead,his eyes fixed listlessly on the ground. He looked up as he noticed theshadow across his path, and at once an expression of relief brightenedhis weary countenance."I ask your pardon, sir," he said, with quaint courtesy. "But will youdo me a small service?"My hand slid into my pocket involuntarily; then I recollected that I wasnot in Britain, and withdrew it again carelessly. "Fire away," I said;"what's the trouble?"The argumentative trio had meanwhile ceased their wordy altercations andwere staring at me eagerly. Their polite spokesman began again:--"I presume you have been in the various Australian cities?"--he noddedin the direction of my portmanteau, which I had set down in the middleof the road, whereon were emblazoned the advertising devices of manyenterprising hotel proprietors."You are certainly a lineal descendant of Sherlock Holmes," I venturedwith mild sarcasm, half wondering if in this remote settlement I hadstumbled upon an adapted version of the old, old confidence trick.He appeared to understand my innuendo, for he flushed up angrily, thensuddenly glancing at his dilapidated wardrobe, he checked a fieryoutburst and smiled feebly instead. His companions too seemed powerfullyaffected by my simple remark, and their wrath did not cool down asswiftly as I would have wished. They crowded around me threateningly,while the vials of their speech overflowed in a tempestuous torrent ofindignant reproaches."We is Ostralians," they bellowed with one voice, "we is----""Calm yourselves, boys," I entreated. "You're oversensitive to be abroadin this wicked world. I said nothing----""An' don't say it again," interrupted the tallest and ugliest of thegroup. "I is known as Long Ted in these parts, I is; an' I fights whenmy fur is raised, I does."It was now my turn to feel annoyed; the aggressive nature of the partyalmost confirmed me in my first doubt."Suppose you stand out of the way," I suggested. "I'm not holding alevee----"The leader at this stage endeavoured to throw oil on the troubledwaters. "I must apologise for bringing this trouble upon you," he said,frowning severely on his associates. "We are not tramps, though I haveno doubt our looks are against us. We are gum-diggers out for a spell;at least my companions are on a holiday; I--I am only going to take careof them.""Then the gum-diggings are here?" I exclaimed in surprise."All round about for sixty miles or more," Long Ted answered gruffly."English Bob is going to Melbourne with us----""Sydney," interjected a voice at his elbow."Adelaide," prompted another.English Bob quelled the rising storm with an impatient gesture. "Youpromised to let a stranger decide the matter," he cried appealingly;then turning to me he continued, "Will you be so kind as give me youropinion on these three cities mentioned. In short, which is the finestof the lot for a holiday?"A murmuring babel of sound followed his words, and the three fire-eatersglared at me savagely, awaiting my verdict. But I had once before beenin a similar position--only once, but that was enough. I realised thatthe harassed Englishman had in tow a South Australian, a citizen of NewSouth Wales, and a Victorian. I approached the delicate question warily."Adelaide is a tidy little town," I hazarded tentatively. Long Ted'sbasilisk-like eyes peered at me dangerously."And Melbourne is a fine city," I continued reflectively. Long Tedsmiled, but his nearest neighbour snarled. I could venture no further."Not for gold or precious stones will I commit myself," I protested. "Iam a peaceable individual----""Ho, ho, ho," laughed English Bob in genuine merriment, slapping meheartily on the shoulder. "You've sized them up right away. I have neverbeen in Australia myself, and cannot understand why my companions shouldhave such diversified opinions on a simple subject. I am certainlyobliged to you for showing them my difficulty, for if you cannot tellthem what they ask, how can I?""Toss for it, boys," I recommended; "it will be the safest way, and canarouse no ill-feeling.""Right you are, mate," shouted Long Ted, and a twin echo of applauseintimated that all danger of immediate disturbance was at an end. Iseized my portmanteau in haste, and proceeded on my interrupted course;but the fighting trio leisurely kept pace, Long Ted gently insinuatingthe bag from my hand into his own horny palm as we walked along."If you don't mind," spoke English Bob, coming up in the rear, "I'd liketo--to shout for you. We've plenty of time to catch the old _Bulimba_,and for my own part I'm not very anxious whether she sails south withoutus or not."I marvelled at this strange _dénoûement_, but said nothing, and togetherwe entered the hotel they had so recently vacated. Within the fiveminutes following our advent into the gilded "saloon bar," I had becomefairly well acquainted with the vicissitudes of the gum-digger's life.Long Ted was as exceedingly communicative as English Bob was reticent,while the remaining pair added titbits of information now and then asoccasion demanded."But what sort of men make it their special calling?" I asked at length."No one seemed very willing to give me any knowledge on the subject inAuckland."English Bob roused himself, and looked at me curiously. "We are acosmopolitan lot," he answered, with just a note of sadness in hisvoice; "we come from all corners of the globe; but no one makes it aspecial calling unless, perhaps, a few Maoris----""We is the dead-beats o' civilisation, that's what we is," put in thegarrulous Ted, with cheerful emphasis. "But say, boss, what is you goin'to do here? Is you goin' into the gum country? Is you full up o' Sydneyand Melbourne too?"I evaded the pertinent allusion, not knowing exactly its true import; Iwas commencing to understand why the gum-diggers were looked upon withsuspicion by their eminently respectable brethren of the towns. Yet inspite of myself my sympathies went out to the world-wanderers who seemedto be brought together in this land through the subtle hand of anall-wise Providence."Give me the bearings of the camps, and I'll go out right away," I said."Gum-digging may suit me as well as gold-digging, and I want to knowwhat it's like, anyhow."At that moment the _Bulimba's_ shrill whistle sounded out on the stillair, and Long Ted immediately grabbed his "swag" and made a bolt for thedoor, a proceeding which his two Australian comrades copied withalacrity."Hold on, boys," I cried; "she won't sail for an hour yet; this is onlya warning blast. Surely you are acquainted with the habits of coastersby this time."English Bob, however, had made no movement, and missing him the excitedtrio came back. "I knows the old _Bulimba_," howled Ted. "CaptainThompson would hustle the blasted barge out just on purpose. Come on,Bob."The Englishman stretched himself lazily, and started to follow hiscompanions, who were again half-way down the street. "Goodbye, sir," hesaid; "I'll see you again soon if you are to remain in the country. Butone word--don't judge by appearances on the gum-fields."I returned his greeting, and thanked him for his advice, "Here's the_Auckland Express_," I said, fishing that paper from my pocket. "It isthe latest date, and will be something to read on the boat."He took it eagerly, and glanced casually down the open sheet; then hisface paled, and the paper dropped from his nerveless fingers. I turnedaside for a moment, and when I looked again, English Bob's countenancewas stern and hard."You'd better go," I advised kindly; "the _Bulimba_ will be moving outsoon."He shook his head. "I have decided to stay and go back with you to thefields," he answered with an effort. "But I'll run down to the wharf andsay good-bye to the boys."He was gone before I could speak another word, and wonderingly I pickedup the paper which had caused such a sudden change of programme. Onlyone item appeared in the page he had scanned which could in any way beconsidered of remotest private interest. But it read as follows: "RobertLorimer, the absconding Bank Manager of a country town in England, hasat last been traced to New Zealand. Local inquiries are beinginstituted, but it is regarded as tolerably certain that the defaulterwill be found in the northern gum-land, and the police of that districthave been warned accordingly. Meanwhile the port of Auckland will bestringently watched."That was all, yet viewed in the light of recent events it was amplysufficient to suggest to me that English Bob and Robert Lorimer were oneand the same person. Still, my late interrogator as to the attractionsof Australian cities did not strike me as being such a man as the baldnews paragraph implied. His face was gentle, and contained a certainquiet dignity, which I felt assured could belong to no criminal'scountenance. His manner, too, was distinctly in his favour. Already Ihad forgotten the unprepossessing garb of the outer man. My reflectionswere cut short by the dismal shriek of the _Bulimia's_ syren--suresignal that that persevering vessel was at last under way."Yes, she's off now," volunteered the bar-tender, surveying the desertedarena beyond the counter ruefully, and making a mental calculation, Ihave no doubt, as to the probable "stagger juice" capacity of hissolitary remaining customer. I disappointed him mightily by making myway outside, and there, to my surprise, I saw English Bob approachingwith Long Ted expostulating volubly by his side."Hallo, Ted!" I cried, "have you also decided to remain where anunfeeling civilisation sent you?""Of course I stays with the boss," responded that gentleman, wiping animaginary tear from his eye, "but my poor old swag has gone with SlimJim and Never Never Dan. They would have stopped too, only they couldn'tswim, an' the darned ship had moved off afore they knew we wasn'tcomin'.""We'll go back to our old camp by the coach to-night," said English Bob."I'm tired of even this fringe of civilisation already. Will you come?"I needed no pressing. Somehow I felt that I was being drawn into thefinal act of a life's drama; the damaging testimony of the _AucklandExpress_ loomed largely before my vision, but the pale sad face of theexile awakened in me pity rather than repulsion, his silent exercise ofa superbly strong will aroused in me admiration."I shall be glad to go with you," I answered.That night we journeyed by mail-coach out towards Wangeri, a constantlyshifting settlement forming the headquarters of the ever-rovinggum-diggers. For the early part of the route our lumbering vehiclecareered over rocky bluffs and steeps, then down into beautiful alluvialvalleys and forest glades, where silvery streams of purest water gushedonwards to meet the sea, their winding channels, glittering in themoon's filtering beams, showing at intervals through the wavy fronds ofthe stately kauri. But soon the majestic forest lands gave place torolling plains of burnt soil, with occasional stretches of fern-swampand tea-tree dunes."This is the old forest country of New Zealand," explained English Bob.Ted had long since fallen asleep."And is the gum not to be found here also?" I asked, somewhat nonplussedto find the site of an ancient forest so bare and desolate.My companion gravely acquiesced. "Gum-diggers are not as a rule acareful class," he said; "and the young timber on these flats has allbeen recklessly burnt down to suit their needs."Long and deep channels here and there intersected the scorched wastes,and mounds like gigantic mole-hills were abundantly evident. But in thevague light only a blurred panorama of the true aspect of things couldbe seen; which was perhaps just as well, for the New Zealand Governmenthas long complained about the devastating nature of the gum-seeker'semployment. They certainly do not make the desert "blossom like therose," but if an opposite parallel could be drawn, it would suit themexactly. This feature of affairs was due, I was told, to the ploddingand ceaseless excavations of a number of Austrians who stormed thecountry many years before, and not to the more leisurely routine pursuedby the orthodox happy-go-lucky digger.Once again, however, we entered a broad timber belt which extended faralong with undulating hillside forming our southern boundary at thisstage, and seemingly feathered the land for a very considerable distancenorthward also. And now many twinkling lights began to shine through thesparse foliage at the base of the tall kauri, and fleeting glimpses werecaught of groups of men standing at the doors of their "whares,"watching the coach rumble past with an odd listlessness which seemedthe more strange considering that the arrival of the mails was but aweekly occurrence, and sometimes not even that when the rainy season wason, and the valleys and flats alike were flooded to a dangerous depth.[Illustration: THE GUM-DIGGERS' SWIMMING POOL.]"Their interest is in their daily occupation," said English Bob,guessing my thoughts. "The men you meet here for the most part know theworld well. This is a haven of rest for the wide earth's wanderers. Mailday to them means little, for they receive few letters and perhaps sendless.""And have you travelled far, that you speak in such a strain?" I askedchidingly. "Surely the world has not grown dim to your eyes, which haveseen fewer years than mine.""Years do not always bring sadness," he answered evasively, "nor doesthe lack of them make one the less liable to suffer. As for mytravels--do not ask. I have----""Wangeri," yelled the driver, reining up the horses with a jerk whichhad the effect of propelling the slumbering Ted heavily on to the floorof the coach. The words that issued from that valiant warrior's lipsthen were sulphurous in the extreme, and the offending Jehu, hearing ofhis own premeditated doom, slid hastily from his perch and vanished intothe night. There was little indeed to see at Wangeri. A small "store andpost-office" occupied the central position in a forest clearing, andaround it in a straggling ring about a dozen log huts were dullydiscernible through the gloom."The whares are scattered all through the forest for miles around," saidEnglish Bob. "Wangeri is only a kind of station for the export of theresin collected. But come along to my little wigwam; it is a bit awayfrom the others, but it's on a good patch, and you are welcome to tryyour luck with Ted and me."I expressed my gratitude in, I fear, rather stinted terms, for the eerieshadow of the great pines had a somewhat depressing influence on myspirits. I tramped on with my new acquaintances in silence, my swagslung picturesquely over my shoulder as in days of yore."It _is_ a bit lonesome like," grumbled Long Ted, as he marched onahead, separating the festooning branches for our easier progress. "Canyou blame a man for being ragged after this?" he demanded irrelevantly afew moments later, his mind apparently reverting to our first meeting.It was clear that Long Ted's frustrated holiday was still a ranklingsubject in that worthy's breast.The air was wonderfully cool and invigorating, despite the enclusteringthicket, and the absence of the ubiquitous mosquito made me marvel not alittle. It was the deathlike silence that hurt; it oppressed the sensesto an appalling degree, and tended to reduce one unaccustomed to forestsolitudes to an enervating state of melancholy. Had the journey beenmade by daylight it might have been different, but fate ordains that thetraveller to this land should first see Nature's most dreary aspect. Iwas startled from my unprofitable musings by English Bob shouting--"Here we are at last. Now, Ted, make us some supper; and let us bemerry, for to-morrow we----""Go out gum-digging," I prompted, sinking down in a corner of theaptly-named wigwam with a sigh of relief.It was a week later. The sun was shining brightly over the sylvan slopesof the great gum region, and tinging the nodding plumes of the statelyforest giants with a deep bronze effulgence; yet down below thespreading branches a perpetual twilight reigned, and here, piercing andtrenching the mossy sward in search of the fossilised resin residue, thestrangely assorted waifs of the world wandered, English Bob and I hadbecome fast friends during our brief sojourn together. Concerning hispast I did not inquire, having already learned that the grim gum-landswallows up many of life's tragedies; but day by day I expected a dread_dénoûement_. The newspaper paragraph still haunted me; my mind wasfilled with conflicting doubts and fears. The motley assembly who formedour neighbours near and distant were a generous and true-hearted people,among whom it was a pleasure to abide. The same environment affectedall, and for the time we were as one huge family, dwelling within theencircling arm of grand old mother Nature.Each day we sallied out armed with spade and spear, the latter implementbeing merely a long pointed stick provided with a handle for leverage,and rarely indeed did we return to camp without a goodly store of theamberlike deposit. The method of working was simple. By means of thespear the spongy soil was easily penetrated, and the presence of any gumstrata localised at once, after which the spade came into play. Thevalue of the crude material thus brought to the surface was no meanfigure, ranging from £50 to £70 a ton.This morning we had been exceptionally fortunate, Long Ted spearing ahuge block of the gelatinous substance almost with his first effort, andwe were busy clearing away the covering earth when two woe-begoneindividuals appeared before us."Slim Jim and Never Never Dan," gasped Long Ted, gazing at theapparitions in undisguised wonder. "Where--what--how--an' ye does have amighty neck to come back in them togs."Then I noticed that the miserable-looking pair were arrayed infashionable raiment, though already considerably torn by contact withthe entangling brush."We didn't git no farther than Auckland," muttered Slim Jimshamefacedly. "We didn't calc'late on goin' nowheres without the boss,so we has come back."English Bob smiled. "But how have you managed to arrive at this time?"he asked. "Surely you did not walk from Wangeri.""We just did," asserted Never Never Dan. "We couldn't wait on the ballyold coach, so we came right away last night----""Come an' have some tucker, you heavenly twins," roared Ted,relinquishing his shovel, his honest face glowing with pleasure at thereturn of the prodigals.When they had departed towards the hut, English Bob looked at meinquiringly. "Could you imagine men like these in any other country thanthis?" he said. "They are just like children."Slowly the sun climbed up in the heavens, and we two persevered at ourwork of excavation. Then gradually I became aware of the rhythmichoof-beats of many horses sounding faintly in the distance, and soon thedense forest rang out with the unwonted echoes. And now the rushing ofthe gum-diggers hither and thither came plainly to our ears, and achorus of warning cries swelled out above the prevailing din--"Thetroopers are coming."At once the truth flashed over me that the man whose whare I shared wasthe object of their search; the inevitable crisis had come at last. Asfor him, he stood almost defiantly erect, with the blood alternatelysurging to his cheeks, then leaving them deathly pallid.I laid my hand on his shoulder. "Why do you try to hide from me thatwhich I already know?" I said gently. "Sometimes it is possible tohelp----""You know?" he gasped."I saw the paper," I answered simply.He covered his face with his hands, and his whole frame shook with astrong man's emotion. "Do you--believe?" he asked hoarsely, withoutlooking at me."Assuredly not," I said.He gave a sigh of thankfulness. "I have been tracked like a dog all overthe world," he murmured brokenly, "but I have reached the end of thetether now.""But why did you run away?" I asked hurriedly. "Surely an innocent manonly courts disaster by flight."The troopers were now near at hand. I could hear their sergeant talkingto some of the diggers scarcely a hundred yards from where we stood.English Bob recovered himself with an extreme effort of will. "I mayhave been foolish," he said quietly, "but things looked very blackagainst me, and--and the disgrace would have killed my old mother."I did not reason further. "There may be a way of escape yet," I said,seized with an uncontrollable impulse. "We are both very much alike.I'll talk to the sergeant.""No, no!" he cried, "I cannot allow----""Why, man," I interrupted impatiently, "it's your only chance. They'llfind out their mistake soon enough.""Good morning, boys," came a jovial voice from the timber, and itsowner, a stalwart New Zealander, bearing the emblem of his office on hisarm, rode forward alone. We responded to this cheery salutationgloomily."Why," he exclaimed, "you've struck a patch here. But I do wish youpeople would be more careful and take out licences before you start todig. The Government is getting rather riled about your free-lance way ofworking.""But we have licences," I remarked mildly.He laughed. "I'm glad of that," he said, "for I find very few of yourneighbours have thought it necessary, and my troopers seem to have thedeuce of a job in explaining matters to them." He wheeled his horse,then reined up again suddenly, and came back. "Which of you is RobertLorimer?" he said directly.His method of procedure appeared to me unnecessarily cruel. "That's me,"I answered sharply, before my companion could speak. "But couldn't youhave asked at first?"He stared at me wonderingly. "Great Southern Cross, man!" he cried."What!" He broke off in a long low whistle, and held out his hand. "Letme be the first to congratulate you, sir," he said. "Of course you couldnot have heard, but you needn't be so hard on me for all that. But letme tell my story," he continued, waving aside my interruptions. "I wasinstructed from headquarters to come for you officially seven days ago,but though I am a policeman I don't like the job of running any man toearth, and I delayed until I should have to come in any case to attendto the licence question. Only yesterday I was informed that the warrantwas off, as the notes you were accused of stealing had been found in anold ledger, placed there, no doubt, by some careless clerk. That's all.Good luck to you, my boy, and a safe journey home."He was gone in an instant. Then English Bob and I clasped hands insilence.WITH THE PEARLERS OF NORTH-WESTERN AUSTRALIAOn the north-western shores of Australia, between Cossack township andPort Darwin, lies a strip of coastline which has not yet received muchattention from the outside world. This is the pearling-grounds of theNor'-West, and the lordly pioneers who rule there hope that theirpreserves may long continue to be neglected by the check-suitedglobe-trotter. The headquarters of the pearling industry is at Broome,the landing station of one of the Australian cable systems. Broome, whenthe fleet is in port, has a population of about 1,500, which is made upof 200 white men, 800 Malays, 100 Japanese, and the same number of whatare termed Manilamen, the remainder being a heterogeneous lot ofaborigines, coolies, Kanakas, and specimens of almost every other raceon earth. When the pearlers are out, however, the town is practicallydeserted.Dampier was the first European to skirt this coast, but it was longafter his advent that it became famous for its pearl-shell deposits,although, even before the great explorer's time, it was probably knownto the aborigines, who until recently were in the habit of gathering forfood the bivalves that the monsoon storms threw up on the beach. Butsince the days of Dampier many changes have occurred on these desolateshores, and it is even doubtful if the coast has the same configurationnow as it had then. While the eastern states of Australia were stillstruggling for existence, the fierce Malay pirates reigned here, andindeed it is only lately that it has been freed from all suspicion inthat respect, although the pirates may not always have been the Malays.The early sea-rovers were not long in finding out that it would pay themto give some attention to the treasures of the sea, and it is probablyowing to their efforts that Roebuck Bay and the Ninety-Mile beach cameinto prominence as pearling-grounds. From that time up to about twentyyears ago these individuals worked the shores and shallows by variousmethods peculiar to themselves, the chief consisting of forcing theunfortunate aborigines to dive for the shells while they merelyextracted the pearls.This system ceased suddenly so far as the power of the Malays wasconcerned; for towards the end of the 'Seventies some colonialadventurers sailed up the coast from Fremantle, and although little isofficially known as to what then transpired, pearling shortly afterwardsbecame a recognised profession among our colonial cousins. Some of thosepioneers are still engaged in the trade, and many strange stories aretold of their doings before the light of civilisation, in the shape oftelegraphic communication, was let in upon their coast.At present, taken as they stand, the pearlers of the Nor'-West are oneof the wealthiest bodies of men in the world. They are certainly one ofthe most daring and most hospitable, and do not hesitate to share theirwealth with any unlucky comrades. The methods in vogue now are muchdifferent from those employed twenty years ago. Beach-combing andenforced labour have given place to specially-designed luggers,profit-sharing systems, and the most modern diving-dresses, althoughamong the South Pacific Islands beach-combing is still another name forpiracy and slave-raiding. Strangely enough, the pearls do not now formthe chief support of the industry. Nevertheless, some are frequentlyfound worth £100 and upwards, and many of a value of £10, while fromthat sum downwards to 1s. for a thousand the pearls are very plentiful.The shell, however, is now the backbone of the industry. It is valued atfrom £100 to £180 per ton, and finds ready sale through Singaporeagencies of London firms at anything between those prices.The pearler of the present day is a Briton in every sense of the word,and takes great care to impress that fact upon all who visit his domain.He usually owns the lugger he commands, but in some cases he has only ashare in it and its profits, the real owner being a speculativegentleman who resides in his schooner and pays only occasional visits tothe various luggers under his flag. In some of these deputy-managedcraft the only qualification necessary to obtain the position of skipperor commander is that of being a white man and not a German; but when themaster pearler goes to the British port of Singapore he is invariablyforced to "come down a bit," and do his business with the prosperous andwell-satisfied sons of the Fatherland.Pearling is chiefly carried on in what are termed "proved grounds"; butif a good haul be made at any time the pearler is not averse toprospecting for new grounds (waters). As a rule the commander is theonly white man on board the lugger. The crew is composed of Malays andcoolies, but the diver is always an intelligent Manilaman or Filipino,who receives a small commission on the results of his work. The depth atwhich the shell is found is now about sixteen fathoms. Of courseshallower ledges are still worked, but it is considered that they arealmost exhausted, and few pearlers waste time over them. In working,the diver is lowered over the gunwale by means of a winch, or in somecases dropped over unceremoniously by two of the Malay crew, and anothertwo pump air down to him.These people are always quarrelling among themselves, and consequentlythe diver runs many risks he does not at the time know of, unless heguesses what is happening above when he experiences the sensationsattending the stoppage of his air supply. He is accustomed to suchtrifles, however, and being more or less a fatalist, probably wonderswhat the men at the pumps are quarrelling about, and in a disinterestedsort of way speculates on which of his two pumpsmen will prove theweaker, and accordingly feed the sharks with him. Notwithstanding theuncertainty of life, he gathers all the shells within his limited rangeof vision, and when--if not too late--the men aloft stop fighting, he ishauled to the gunwale, where he is relieved of his spoil and droppedover again.The shells are found in patches, and when one deposit is exhausted--orperhaps before, for the vessel is drifting all the time--the diver moveson to the next, crashing through dense forests of coral and otherstrange submarine growths _en route_, and frequently having to cut thefearful coiling creepers from his person. Often, too, he is precipitatedinto a deep, dark chasm of unknown extent. In such moments the diver'ssole idea is to preserve his balance, for he is really but afeather-weight in the water at the sixteen-fathom level, and in due timehe is safely hauled across the gulf, when, if he has not retained avertical position, or if his line has not been kept taut overhead, he isdragged head-first through any vegetation or oozy slime that may lie inhis path. When he regains his equilibrium, he once more turns hisattention to the oyster-beds.[Illustration: READY TO GO DOWN.]Meanwhile the lugger drifts erratically over the surface of the ocean.An evil-eyed Malay may be asleep by the tiller, and the white commanderwill likewise be serenely indifferent to his surroundings, unless thethought strikes him that the quality of the last case of whisky he hadwas not in accordance with the labels on the bottles or the price hepaid, in which event he will probably be making things lively among thecrew, and the profits of the trip will increase in proportion. Everyfifteen minutes or so the diver comes up for a "blow." If the shells areplentiful he may send them up in a net between times; but, as a rule,there are a few yards separating the shells of any size, and it is notoften that he cannot bring them all aloft with him. A "blow" to thisindividual means being suspended over the gunwale with his helmetunscrewed for such time as the lugger may take to sail to the next knownpatch, after which he is allowed to drop again.When a full cargo of shell has been obtained, the lugger's course isshaped towards Broome, where the molluscs are opened in sheds erectedfor the purpose. In the cases of the pearlers who possess severalluggers a schooner is sent round periodically to collect the shell fromthe smaller craft, thus saving the latter a journey which they are illable to accomplish, owing to their peculiar design and extremely smallfreeboard. The process of opening is sometimes carried on while theschooner sails for Broome; but, as most of the pearler kings make theirhomes on board these vessels now, and do not care to suffer theattending unpleasantness, the system is fast dying out, and theschooner, in turn, discharges at the Broome opening-sheds.The methods of opening are many. In the early days the shells were tornapart with a knife or any other convenient weapon, and if no pearlsrewarded a brief search, the carcass of the oyster was scooped out andleft to rot on the sand until a merciful monsoon tide caused itsremoval. Lately, however, the pearlers have copied the plan of theChinese beachcombers of the Archipelago, and a simpler system could notwell be devised. The shells are laid on a slightly-inclined bench, atthe lowest edge of which is a carefully-constructed ledge containingsome water in the angle formed. After two days in this position theoyster "gapes" and "spits out" the pearl--if any--which, of course,rolls down the bench until it is caught in the angle, from where it isgathered by the attendant Japanese or coolies. The number of pearlsobtained in this way is about 30 per cent. greater than was formerly thecase by the forcible method, and it is therefore evident that the hastypearlers must have lost a considerable amount through their carelessnessand the incompleteness of their method of extraction. As said before,the pearls do not now form the chief part of the business; neverthelessthere are usually a fair number in the shells discharged from oneschooner. When the pearls have been collected the molluscs are cleanedout from the shells and either buried or otherwise destroyed, their latecasings being stored to await shipment. The chief opening establishmentsare owned by a London syndicate of jewellers, who employ in theirservice as many aborigines, coolies, and Japanese as may care to offerthemselves. This syndicate is always willing to purchase "on chance" anyshipment of shell that may come into port, and have a large fleet oftheir own luggers constantly on the waters during the season. As mightbe expected, this organised company is not liked by the independentpearlers, who--rightly or not--imagine that a monopoly of the trade isthe real object in view. To such an extent is this rivalry carried that,notwithstanding the fact that Messrs. S. & Co. have special facilitiesfor shipping, and will pay full Singapore prices for all shells sold tothem, the pearlers, unless temporarily financially embarrassed, willhave nothing to do with them, and prefer to pay the expense of shippingtheir own shell to Singapore by some of the Holt Line of steamers, whichcall regularly in at Broome for that purpose while _en route_ fromFremantle to the great Oriental metropolis.During the monsoon season the pearling fleet shelters in Roebuck Bay, onthe shores of which Broome stands, and then that wicked andevil-smelling township wakens up from its sleep. Its drinking saloonsare crowded with black, yellow, and white humanity; the joss-houses arefilled with maddened nondescripts; and the far-seeing abilities andcorrect judgment of the man who designed the prison to hold the entirepopulation becomes apparent. Unfortunately there are some renegadewhites who run gambling-hells; but, in justice to Britons at large, itshould be stated that these men are mostly mongrel foreigners. Themaster pearlers, as a rule, do not frequent these places, preferring thenarrower but healthier confines of their own vessels to that of thefilthy, mosquito-infested town; but if any do go ashore, they all meetin a saloon owned by a gentleman with a very Highland name and duskycountenance, or in the cable-house, where fortunes may be gambled awayin a night. These men are indifferent to this matter. Money, to most ofthem, has no attractions, and if they were denied the excitement ofbeing alternately worth a fair fortune and without a sixpence in theirpossession they would probably die of _ennui_. But some of thepearlers--indeed, the majority--are made of sterner stuff; they stillretain memories of lands where green vegetation and flowing streams ofcrystal water take the place of hideous mangrove swamps and parchingdeserts, and their efforts are all made in the hope that some day theresults will enable them to return to those lands. These men only comeinto Broome when in need of stores, and, after landing their crews,spend the "off" season in some of the numerous bays and inlets farthernorth, occasionally finding rich patches in those sheltered soundscapable of being worked at all seasons.It matters little on this coast what the original temperament of anyperson may have been, the influence of his surroundings soon has itseffect upon him and makes him like his fellows. With the pearlers thistakes the form of a feeling of reckless indifference, and a strangersuddenly thrown among them sees much to interest and amuse him in theincongruities brought about by this state of affairs.When I visited this quarter I was not aware that there was any specialindustry carried on; in fact, I did not even know that a townshipexisted between Roebourne and Derby until one evening the SS. _Nemesis_sailed into Roebuck Bay, and the skipper calmly announced that I wouldrequire to go ashore and await the next steamer, as he was going nofarther. I was booked to London, _viâ_ Singapore, but I had expected tobe dumped ashore somewhere, as the _Nemesis_ was not the regularconnecting steamer, and I had taken it chiefly with the desire to getaway from plague-stricken Fremantle, to which city I had come round fromNorthern Queensland."All right, captain," I said; "but you might give me my bearings first.""Go straight ahead from the jetty until you see the cable station, thenstarboard hard, and you are into Roderick's Hotel. Drinks don't costmore than a shilling there.""Thanks. But what is the name of the port? I presume we are still inAustralia?""We are. This is Broome, the headquarters of the pearling fleet, and thehottest hole on earth.""Oh, I think I'll survive till the _Australind_ comes along," I said, asindifferently as I could; and, after seeing my baggage on shore, Ifollowed out the captain's directions, and finally entered a well-litsaloon, in which the strains of a gramaphone were evidently causing muchappreciation. No one seemed to notice me as I made my way forward. Allthe occupants were clustered round the gramaphone and indulging invarious comments as to the correctness of the song it was giving forth.There were about ten men in the party, all of whom were white. Some weregarbed in the most approved London clubland fashion, while others werevery scantily clad indeed; but the careless manner in which handfuls ofsovereigns were occasionally flung down on the counter showed that moneyat least was not much of a consideration with any of them."Hallo, boys! here's a stranger," suddenly cried one, seeing me lookingon interestedly, and instantly a general move was made in my direction."Name it, boss," spoke the bar-tender, coming forward; "that is, if youis not an S----'s man.""What will happen if I am?" I inquired, slightly curious to know what anS----'s man was."You'll get fired; that's all----""Shut up, Bob," reproved a tall, broad-shouldered man. "This is themaster-pearlers' club," he continued, addressing me, "and as a strangeryou are very welcome to whatever it affords.""Thank you, but I understood that this was Roderick's Hotel?""Same thing," laughed several of the men. "Who sent you here?""Captain Lawrence of the _Nemesis_.""Then it's all O.K. He is one of us," said the first speaker. "You willbe my guest to-night, after which we will consider what is best to dowith you.""Gently there; I am a Britisher, and quite able to look after myself.""You can bet, my boy, that we're all coloured red here, but of course ifyou don't wish----""You are needing a spell south, Wilcox," interrupted another gentleman."You don't give the stranger half a chance. We are pearlers," hecontinued, turning to me. "This is the off season, and as hell is letloose in this town when the fleet is at home, we arrange to look afterany white stranger that may be cast upon these shores. Listen! There'sthe Malays' infernal racket starting now. I shouldn't wonder but theywill have a fight with the aborigines before morning.""I see I have made a mistake, then, gentlemen," I said, "in coming here,but I assure you that it was not from choice I came.""Oh, don't let that trouble you. We are very glad to have you. But youcan now understand why we reserve this hotel for our own use. We don'tall necessarily make beasts of ourselves, although you see us here. Someof us, it is true, have a failing that way, and there are others over inthe cable shanty now going it pretty stiff; we therefore make it a pointthat a dozen of us come here every night to look after any of the boyswho may take more stagger-juice than they can carry; but allow me tointroduce the company. This is Alf Chambers. Here is SamWilcox--Moore--Macpherson--Edward Wilson, commonly known as DandyDick--Will Biddles--Gordon, of G.B. diving-dress fame, and, the finestgentleman on the Australian coast, Gentleman James----""What about yourself, Cap?" spoke the last-named, waving his handdeprecatingly at the compliment."Me? Oh, I forgot. I am Biddles. You may have heard of me down inPerth?""I believe I have," I answered. "You are the man whom the Americanskipper mistook for a pirate, and who, up in King Sound----""I see you have my history all right, lad; but there goes thedinner-gong, so come along and sample Broome fare."In the company of the light-hearted pearlers the time passed veryquickly. It transpired that I had known in Queensland some of theircomrades who had drifted down country from the Gulf pearling-grounds,and being well accustomed to meeting all sorts of people, I readilygrasped the little peculiarities of my hosts, and soon became on thebest of terms with them all."I think we'll go now, boys," said Wilcox, some time about midnight."You fellows that are sober can see after the other boys, and we twowill get aboard the _Thetis_.""Why, don't you stay here?" I cried."Not likely. There wouldn't be an ounce of blood left in us by morning.The mosquitoes here are A 1; but can you swim?""A little. Why?""Because I expect you will have to. You see we don't care to give themob a chance of going aboard while we are on shore; so we never use ourdinghys.""Oh, how about your clothes?""Leave them on the jetty. I always send the cook round for them in themorning."I did not answer; I recognised that I was again among a strange people.We were now threading our way among the coolies' huts and shantiestowards the beach. The moon was shining brightly, thus enabling us tojump over several forms which were huddled up in various positionsacross our path without disturbing them."These people would stick a knife in a man for his bootlaces," mycompanion remarked; "but luckily they are always too drunk to stand.""But if you treated them fairly might there not be better results?""Look here, my lad, you've still got some of the old country notionsabout you. You can't treat the Malays as you do white men. They do notunderstand what gratitude means. Great Southern Cross! don't you knowthe history of this coast? Haven't you heard of poor Woods? He was goingto reform everything. Gave the beggars a share of the profits, and wagesbesides. First thing we knew was when his Chinese cook rushed intoRoderick's one night and told some of us that Woods's crew had mutiniedbecause of their tinned dog being off colour--as if it ever was anythingelse.""And what was the result?""Oh, they killed Woods and threw his body into the sea, and then sailedfor Java. The cook jumped overboard and swam ashore, and that's how weknew. The Dutchmen chased them up and sent them back from Surabaya inchains, and we hung them.""These men were Malays?""Yes, but the half-castes and aborigines are just as bad. Take the caseof Dr. Vines, for instance; they murdered him because he couldn't givethem what he hadn't got himself. And then there was Captain Skinner; butyou'll not sleep if I tell you any more. Yonder is my craft. Get ready."Wilcox discarded his coat as he spoke and plunged into the invitingwaters, and somewhat dubiously I followed; for although my garments wereof the usual Siamese silk variety, and therefore did not greatly impedemy movements, I could not help wondering what would happen if therewere any sharks about. As I struggled after Wilcox this thought keptrecurring to me in spite of all my attempts to convince myself thatthere could be no such creatures there, and just when I had almostsucceeded in believing that such might somehow be the case, I suddenlyremembered that I had been watching these very monsters playing aroundthe _Nemesis_ all that afternoon."What about sharks?" I gasped, as the stern light of the _Thetis_ shoneout ahead."They're too well fed here to trouble about white men," came the reply,and I had to satisfy myself with the hope that the sharks would be ableto distinguish without personal investigation that I was of thefortunate colour. We reached the schooner without mishap, however, andscrambled over its stern by means of a friendly rope, and soon after Iwas asleep in what might have been a comfortable berth but for thepresence of some hundreds of other occupants of divers kinds.Next morning I found my baggage and the clothes I had thrown off in thecabin beside me, and on going out on deck had my first view of Broome bydaylight. It was not much to look at. There were some tents, two orthree dozen "humpies" and "wind-breaks," and about twelvegalvanised-iron structures, of which the jail, the cable station,Gummows' and Roderick's Hotels, were the most conspicuous. The _Nemesis_had sailed away south again during the night, and there was no sign oflife anywhere. During the day--by way of a treat--Wilcox and some otherstook me to inspect "their prison," in which they had evidently greatpride; but I could not work up any enthusiasm over the sight of a scoreof miserable wretches chained together by the ankles."These are the murderers of old Smith," remarked one of my companions."They turned on him because he plugged one of them with a '44,' one daywhen he was drunk, up in King Sound.""We're keeping them here until we can get an executioner," added thejailer, "but it's spoiling the trade of the town; every one is afraid ofgetting drunk, as they might then be induced to take the job on."I was glad when we left the place, and, eager to obtain information of amore pleasant kind, I asked to be shown the opening sheds."Well, you are a strange fellow!" was Wilcox's only comment as he ledthe way thither, and as we neared the shell-strewn benches I began tounderstand the meaning of his words, and signified that, after all, Ithought I would rather not go farther."They do smell a bit strong," laughed my friend; "but we're not nearenough yet, and the wind is not off the proper quarter to give a Broomeappetiser. But there's Biddles semaphoring for us to dine with him inthe club; let's get along."Several days passed agreeably enough to me among these free-heartedBritons; but in time I began to calculate when the next steamer would bedue. "I fear there's no steamer coming into Broome for two months, myboy," said Captain Biddles, when I asked him, and a visit to the cablestation confirmed his fears; for, when the obliging officials therewired to Fremantle, they received the reply that the SS. _Australind_would miss Broome and call instead at Derby, on the head of King Sound."Then I will have to cross country to Derby," I said. "I suppose that iseasy enough; the telegraph line runs all the way?""Oh, it's about as easy as going to heaven!" answered Biddles. "Theaborigines are very considerate between here and Derby--they always killyou before they make a dinner out of you. But are you sure you can'tstay here?""It is four years since I was north of the equator," I said, "and I havea strong desire to cross it as soon as possible.""In that case, I suppose you will have to go. Wish I could myself.""Why can't you? You are rich enough now, surely?""Ha, ha! Imagine old Biddles going back to civilisation! Why, man, theywould---- Well, well; never mind. Here's the boys coming. We'll see whatcan be done."That evening I was informed that the _Bessie Fraser_ was to sail northto King Sound in the morning with stores for George Hobart's schooners.I could go with it, and Hobart would find some means of landing me atDerby. This arrangement, the pearlers assured me, was not made in mybehalf, as the _Bessie Fraser_ would have to sail in any case. Thus itcame about that next morning I parted with my kindly friends, and incompany with Harry Quin, the skipper, six Malays for a crew, a Chinesecook, and a Manilaman diver, rounded the long, sandy point and headednorthwards.After lunch, the captain announced his intention of having a sleep if Ididn't mind, and, thinking that he would require to be on the watchduring the night, which would certainly be stormy, I said that I couldeasily pass the time looking round, and, in an endeavour to do so, soonafter entered into conversation with the cook."Is it going to be rough to-night, John?" I said, by way ofintroduction, watching him as he went through some mysteriousperformances necessary for the preparation of our next meal."Velly. Me no need make breakfast. Captain sick. No want any.""What! The captain sick? What do you mean?""Huh! Him no sail man. Him only gole' glabber; no know nothing 'boutsea. D----" John disappeared as he gave vent to his last exclamation,and, turning round, I saw that Aguinili, the diver and sarang, wasapproaching."Good day, sir," he said, in excellent English."Good day, Aguinili. You have given Ah Sing a fright.""He gabble gabble all day when captain not well.""Great Scot! What is wrong? The captain was all right half an hour ago.""Yes, but we are round the head now, and the monsoon is on. I come speakwith you, for to-night I have only one man to steer with me; the rest nogood. I come ask will you take helm for time to-night, else we must goback?"I was certainly surprised at Aguinili's words, but, grasping theirimport, I at once signified that I would willingly take a watch, andfollowing him aft, I was made acquainted with the little peculiaritiesof the schooner in regards to her steering."Malay bad man--you no trust him," remarked Aguinili. "No let them knowcaptain not well?""Never fear!" I answered; "I have sailed with their kind before. Butcall me when you want me, for I cannot navigate by the stars as you do,so I must hunt up a chart and get out my own instruments."At that moment Ah Sing came aft and informed me that the captain desiredmy presence, so, making my way to his stuffy cabin, I soon stood besidehim. He was lying in his bunk reading, but as I entered he cast asidethe book and said, "I say, mate, ye needn't give me away more than yecan help.""Why, what's the matter?""Nothing, so long as I lie on my back; but this darned motion doesn'tagree with me in any other position.""Do you mean to say----?""That I is no sailor? You struck the bull first shot. I ain't. I is agold-miner, and got stranded in Broome after making a pile on the MarbleBar fields, an' losing it down in Roebourne. Lord knows how I got here,but old Wilcox got me this billet with Hobart, 'cause I could swear atthe nigs better than any man he knowed. I know nothing about navigationexcept what a bushman knows, and here I is at sea entirely.""But have you never had any accidents?""Oh, there have been some narrow squeaks, but that chap Aguinili is asmart fellow; he manages somehow, and I swears at---- Lor'! but I isbad. Oh!----""You'll be all right soon," I said sympathisingly, as I left him. He wasthe best example of a bluffer I had ever come across, but he had thetrue grit of the sons of the Southern Cross, and as he knew nothing ofnavigation, he got along wonderfully well by leaving everything to fateand Aguinili.It was a very rough night, but the _Bessie Fraser_ weathered it allright, thanks to the skilful handling of the sarang. Next evening weentered King Sound, and by seven o'clock were safely moored alongsidethe schooner _Electron_, George Hobart's headquarters.This gentleman was a very superior person to those usually met in suchlatitudes; he was of a scientific turn of mind, and had designed manystrange appliances which were the wonder and admiration of the pearlingfraternity."You have just arrived in time to witness the trial of my new dress,"were almost his first words to me; and after dinner, in answer to myinquiry, he proceeded to explain wherein his dress differed fromothers, and to point out its anticipated advantages. "Sixteen fathoms isthe greatest depth at which we can work with the old dress, you know,"he said, "and even at that a diver can only last out three seasons.""Well, what's the odds?" interrupted Quin; "they're cheap, ain't they?and there's any amount where they come from.""That may be; but this dress is designed to give the diver a longerlease of life, and also to enable him to stand a good two or threefathoms more pressure. I have just got down a new G.B. dress fromSingapore, and I intend to try mine alongside it to-morrow."I did not then know what a G.B. dress was, but not wishing to display myignorance, I did not inquire, and during the evening's conversation Igathered that it was the invention of two Glasgow engineers, who haddesigned it to allow of greater depths being explored.In the morning all hands began to prepare for the trials, and afterbreakfast Aguinili, as the most experienced diver, was lowered from thederrick in the G.B. dress, and Jim Mackenzie, the _Electron's_ chiefofficer, was also weighted and dropped over in Hobart's."Isn't there a nigger handy to go down in the old dress now?" askedQuin, kicking over a helmet. "I'll go two to one on it yet.""The water is too deep here," answered Hobart. "No man could bottom inthe old dress.""I'll go," said the intrepid Quin, "and chance it.""No. Hallo! Mackenzie is down. Great heavens! The pumps are notworking." Hobart sprang to the pumps, and threw the two Malay operatorsacross the deck, then, assisted by Quin and myself, began pumpingfuriously. It was useless. The pumps were not drawing air. Theperspiration burst out over my face as I realised the position thatpoor Mackenzie was in. Quin swore, and then rushed to the winch, wherethe crew, in answer to Hobart's signal, were already hauling in. In lesstime than it takes to tell the diver was above the surface, and inanother second his helmet was unscrewed."Poor old Mac," said Quin, as the limp form was removed from its cage;"I always reckoned that he would peg out before me.""Wrong again, Quin," feebly murmured Mackenzie. "You won't be mate ofthe _Electron_ this trip----But I say, there's shells down there as bigas a table, and they are packed like peas.""Never mind them at present, Mac," spoke Hobart. "We're glad to see youall right again; but what happened to the dress----?""The dress is all right, but the beggars must have stopped pumping whileI was sinking, and when they started again I fancy the check-valve wouldnot work.""Ah! then we burst the connection on deck when we rushed to the pumps.That means my dress won't do for twenty fathoms at any rate. Hallo!there's Aguinili's signal. Haul away. Why, it is shell, and look at thesize."In answer to the diver's signal the men had hauled up his shell-net, andwhen it appeared above the waters the size of the shells had drawn forthan exclamation of surprise from all. Soon after Aguinili himself came upladen with the spoil of the nineteen-fathom ledge, and when he wasbrought on deck and his helmet removed he told a wonderful story of thewealth of the deep deposits, which hitherto no man had seen."Shell plenty. No need move away; fill net all time same place. Goodshell for pearl, I know that, for I see sea-snake feed much. I go downagain quick.""No, no, Aguinili," cried Hobart, handing him a glass of spirits. "Wehave plenty of time for that. Have the shell been moving much?""No. Shells grow there. No currents; no monsoons; deep, deep coralbottom. No shell on sixteen-fathom bottom here.""Well, gentlemen," finally said Hobart, "we have seen the result of theG.B. comes out first. I will cable to Singapore to send down some moreof them, and I will see that Gentleman James, Captain Biddies, and theothers get to know of its good points. Who knows what fortunes we maynow obtain from these deep neglected sounds."Two hours afterwards the _Electron_ was sailing down King Sound towardsthe Indian Ocean, and on my venturing to ask where we were bound for,Hobart informed me that he had received word from Derby that the bubonicplague had broken out afresh in Fremantle, and it was therefore obviousthat the _Australind_ would not now call at the northern port; for ifshe did so she would assuredly be quarantined at Singapore through nothaving been sufficient time at sea since leaving Australian waters."We are going to put you on board now," he added, "and Mackenzie isgoing up to Raffles with you to see about the new dresses. Meanwhile themen are opening the shells from the deep level, and I hope that we willfind a memento to give you of your visit to this coast."Early in the afternoon a long hanging cloud of black smoke becamevisible away on the southern horizon, and knowing that it must beissuing from the funnels of the _Australind_ or the Adelaide SteamshipCo.'s trader _Albany_, we steered out to investigate, and, if need be,to intercept. It proved to be the former vessel, and in due course sheanswered our signal and hove to."Well, goodbye then, lad. I hope you will come back to this coast whenyou are tired of the old country," were Hobart's parting words asMackenzie and I clambered up the sides of the _Australind_."If you see a lugger cheap at Singapore you might buy it for me," criedQuin, throwing me a miner's gold-bag; "and, I say, you might send me thesecond part of the book you gave me to read when we were coming upthrough the monsoon on the _Bessie_. I am darned curious to know thewind-up.""And here's a pair of the deep shells; take care of them," cried Hobart,fastening a couple into the sling in which my baggage was being hoisted.       *       *       *       *       *Three days after landing at Singapore I bought a small lugger for Quin,and sent back the balance of his money, and a complete copy of the"Pilgrim's Progress" (which was the book requested) with Mackenzie, whoalso undertook to see about the lugger going south. Four days later,while tossing in the bay of Bengal on the SS. _Ballarat_, I began torearrange my belongings so that they might be readily transferred to theconnecting P. and O. mail steamer _Himalaya_ at Colombo. In doing so Ichanced to open my shells and found therein two magnificent pearls, anda note which read: "Please accept one of the enclosed from me. The otheris from Aguinili, who has asked me to offer it to you in kindremembrance."

Helped by over 100 merchants (Siberian, Russian, Danish andEnglish) the writer was able to collect much information, and observethe present social and industrial condition of the country. The tradeand country life of the mixed races of Siberia is described, andvaluable information is given about their chief industry (dairyproduce), which goes far to dissipate the common idea that Siberia issnow-bound, and to show that it is now one of the leading agriculturalcountries in the world.    *       *       *       *       *The author describes his unaccompanied climbs in the mountains which hediscovered in the Kutunski Belki range in the Altai, about 800 miles offthe Great Siberian Railway line from a point about 2,500 miles beyondMoscow. He made a winter journey of 1,600 miles on sledge, drosky, andhorseback, 250 miles of this journey being through country which hasnever been penetrated by any other European even in summer. He alsodescribes 40 miles of what was probably the most difficult winterexploration that has ever been undertaken, proving that even the rigourof a Siberian winter cannot keep a true mountaineer from scaling unknownpeaks.    *       *       *       *       *The volume is elaborately illustrated from photographs by the author."To the trader and to the explorer, and to many who are neither, but wholove to read books of travel and to venture in imagination into wildplaces of the earth, this book is heartily to be commended. It islively, entertaining, instructive. It throws fresh light on the Empireof the Czars. Above all, it is a record of British pluck."--_Scotsman._LONDON: T.

FISHER UNWIN._Demy 8vo, cloth, 21/-_Somerset House, Past and PresentBY RAYMOND NEEDHAM AND ALEXANDER WEBSTER._With Photogravure Frontispiece and many Illustrations._This book deals with the history of Somerset House fromits foundation by the Lord Protector in 1547 to thepresent day. It is as far as possible a continuous record of theevents which in times gone by gathered illustrious personageswithin the walls of the old palace and made it a centre ofEnglish social life. For two centuries Somerset House was thehome of Queens and Princesses; it was associated with thestalwart Protestants of the Reformation and the intriguingCatholics of the Revolution; it has passed through greatervicissitudes than almost any other secular edifice in London.The modern building housed the early exhibitions of the RoyalAcademy of Arts, a Naval Museum, the Royal and other learnedSocieties, until, within the last fifty years, it was given over toits present occupants and the matter-of-fact romance of theImperial Revenue. The history includes the story of King'sCollege, which since its inauguration has occupied a buildingerected on the eastern edge of the site, and designed toharmonise with the main structure. The volume is illustratedby reproductions of rare old prints and a fine series of modernphotographs.LONDON: T.

SOLLAS, LL.D., D.Sc., F.R.S.Professor of Geology in the University of Oxford_Illustrated._This volume, while written by one of the foremost of English geologists,will be found interesting and attractive by the reader who has nospecial knowledge of the science. The essay which gives the book itstitle sets forth the bearing of the doctrine of evolution on geologicalspeculation, and particularly on the vexed question of our planet'santiquity. The subjects of the other studies include the following: TheFigure of the Earth, and the Origin of the Ocean; Geologies and Deluges;the Volcanoes of the Lipari Isles; the History and Structure of a CoralReef; the Origin and Formation of Flints; the Evolution of FreshwaterAnimals; and the Influence of Oxford on Geology."They range over a great variety of subjects, including many which areof sufficiently wide interest to bring the geologist into sympathetictouch with the general reader. What educated man can fail to beinterested in such subjects, for instance, as the age of the earth, thebuilding of coral islands, the cause of volcanic action, or the Deluge?Of all these matters the Professor discourses pleasantly and well,writing with command of much scientific learning, yet always readably,sometimes with brilliancy of diction, and occasionally with a touch ofhumour."--_Athenæum._LONDON: T.

HTML version by Al Haines.BURNING DAYLIGHTbyJack LondonPART ICHAPTER IIt was a quiet night in the Shovel.  At the bar, which ranged along oneside of the large chinked-log room, leaned half a dozen men, two ofwhom were discussing the relative merits of spruce-tea and lime-juiceas remedies for scurvy.  They argued with an air of depression and withintervals of morose silence. The other men scarcely heeded them.  In arow, against the opposite wall, were the gambling games.  Thecrap-table was deserted.  One lone man was playing at the faro-table.The roulette-ball was not even spinning, and the gamekeeper stood bythe roaring, red-hot stove, talking with the young, dark-eyed woman,comely of face and figure, who was known from Juneau to Fort Yukon asthe Virgin.  Three men sat in at stud-poker, but they played with smallchips and without enthusiasm, while there were no onlookers.  On thefloor of the dancing-room, which opened out at the rear, three coupleswere waltzing drearily to the strains of a violin and a piano.Circle City was not deserted, nor was money tight.  The miners were infrom Moseyed Creek and the other diggings to the west, the summerwashing had been good, and the men's pouches were heavy with dust andnuggets.  The Klondike had not yet been discovered, nor had the minersof the Yukon learned the possibilities of deep digging and wood-firing.No work was done in the winter, and they made a practice of hibernatingin the large camps like Circle City during the long Arctic night.  Timewas heavy on their hands, their pouches were well filled, and the onlysocial diversion to be found was in the saloons.  Yet the Shovel waspractically deserted, and the Virgin, standing by the stove, yawnedwith uncovered mouth and said to Charley Bates:--"If something don't happen soon, I'm gin' to bed.  What's the matterwith the camp, anyway?  Everybody dead?"Bates did not even trouble to reply, but went on moodily rolling acigarette.  Dan MacDonald, pioneer saloonman and gambler on the upperYukon, owner and proprietor of the Tivoli and all its games, wanderedforlornly across the great vacant space of floor and joined the two atthe stove."Anybody dead?" the Virgin asked him."Looks like it," was the answer."Then it must be the whole camp," she said with an air of finality andwith another yawn.MacDonald grinned and nodded, and opened his mouth to speak, when thefront door swung wide and a man appeared in the light.  A rush offrost, turned to vapor by the heat of the room, swirled about him tohis knees and poured on across the floor, growing thinner and thinner,and perishing a dozen feet from the stove. Taking the wisp broom fromits nail inside the door, the newcomer brushed the snow from hismoccasins and high German socks.  He would have appeared a large manhad not a huge French-Canadian stepped up to him from the bar andgripped his hand."Hello, Daylight!" was his greeting.  "By Gar, you good for sore eyes!""Hello, Louis, when did you-all blow in?" returned the newcomer. "Comeup and have a drink and tell us all about Bone Creek.  Why, dog-goneyou-all, shake again.  Where's that pardner of yours? I'm looking forhim."Another huge man detached himself from the bar to shake hands. OlafHenderson and French Louis, partners together on Bone Creek, were thetwo largest men in the country, and though they were but half a headtaller than the newcomer, between them he was dwarfed completely."Hello, Olaf, you're my meat, savvee that," said the one calledDaylight.  "To-morrow's my birthday, and I'm going to put you-all onyour back--savvee?  And you, too, Louis.  I can put you-all on yourback on my birthday--savvee?  Come up and drink, Olaf, and I'll tellyou-all about it."The arrival of the newcomer seemed to send a flood of warmth throughthe place.  "It's Burning Daylight," the Virgin cried, the first torecognize him as he came into the light.  Charley Bates' tight featuresrelaxed at the sight, and MacDonald went over and joined the three atthe bar.  With the advent of Burning Daylight the whole place becamesuddenly brighter and cheerier. The barkeepers were active.  Voiceswere raised.  Somebody laughed.  And when the fiddler, peering into thefront room, remarked to the pianist, "It's Burning Daylight," thewaltz-time perceptibly quickened, and the dancers, catching thecontagion, began to whirl about as if they really enjoyed it.  It wasknown to them of old time that nothing languished when Burning Daylightwas around.He turned from the bar and saw the woman by the stove and the eagerlook of welcome she extended him."Hello, Virgin, old girl," he called.  "Hello, Charley.  What's thematter with you-all?  Why wear faces like that when coffins cost onlythree ounces?  Come up, you-all, and drink.  Come up, you unburieddead, and name your poison.  Come up, everybody. This is my night, andI'm going to ride it.  To-morrow I'm thirty, and then I'll be an oldman.  It's the last fling of youth.  Are you-all with me?  Surge along,then.  Surge along."Hold on there, Davis,"  he called to the faro-dealer, who had shovedhis chair back from the table.  "I'm going you one flutter to seewhether you-all drink with me or we-all drink with you."Pulling a heavy sack of gold-dust from his coat pocket, he dropped iton the HIGH CARD."Fifty," he said.The faro-dealer slipped two cards.  The high card won.  He scribbledthe amount on a pad, and the weigher at the bar balanced fifty dollars'worth of dust in the gold-scales and poured it into Burning Daylight'ssack.  The waltz in the back room being finished, the three couples,followed by the fiddler and the pianist and heading for the bar, caughtDaylight's eye."Surge along, you-all" he cried.  "Surge along and name it.  This is mynight, and it ain't a night that comes frequent.  Surge up, youSiwashes and Salmon-eaters.  It's my night, I tell you-all--""A blame mangy night," Charley Bates interpolated."You're right, my son," Burning Daylight went on gaily."A mangy night, but it's MY night, you see.  I'm the mangy old he-wolf.Listen to me howl."And howl he did, like a lone gray timber wolf, till the Virgin thrusther pretty fingers in her ears and shivered.  A minute later she waswhirled away in his arms to the dancing-floor, where, along with theother three women and their partners, a rollicking Virginia reel wassoon in progress.  Men and women danced in moccasins, and the place wassoon a-roar, Burning Daylight the centre of it and the animating spark,with quip and jest and rough merriment rousing them out of the sloughof despond in which he had found them.The atmosphere of the place changed with his coming.  He seemed to fillit with his tremendous vitality.  Men who entered from the street feltit immediately, and in response to their queries the barkeepers noddedat the back room, and said comprehensively, "Burning Daylight's on thetear."  And the men who entered remained, and kept the barkeepersbusy.  The gamblers took heart of life, and soon the tables werefilled, the click of chips and whir of the roulette-ball risingmonotonously and imperiously above the hoarse rumble of men's voicesand their oaths and heavy laughs.Few men knew Elam Harnish by any other name than Burning Daylight, thename which had been given him in the early days in the land because ofhis habit of routing his comrades out of their blankets with thecomplaint that daylight was burning.  Of the pioneers in that farArctic wilderness, where all men were pioneers, he was reckoned amongthe oldest.  Men like Al Mayo and Jack McQuestion antedated him; butthey had entered the land by crossing the Rockies from the Hudson Baycountry to the east. He, however, had been the pioneer over theChilcoot and Chilcat passes.  In the spring of 1883, twelve yearsbefore, a stripling of eighteen, he had crossed over the Chilcoot withfive comrades.In the fall he had crossed back with one.  Four had perished bymischance in the bleak, uncharted vastness.  And for twelve years ElamHarnish had continued to grope for gold among the shadows of the Circle.And no man had groped so obstinately nor so enduringly.  He had grownup with the land.  He knew no other land.  Civilization was a dream ofsome previous life.  Camps like Forty Mile and Circle City were to himmetropolises.  And not alone had he grown up with the land, for, raw asit was, he had helped to make it.  He had made history and geography,and those that followed wrote of his traverses and charted the trailshis feet had broken.Heroes are seldom given to hero-worship, but among those of that youngland, young as he was, he was accounted an elder hero.  In point oftime he was before them.  In point of deed he was beyond them.  Inpoint of endurance it was acknowledged that he could kill the hardiestof them.  Furthermore, he was accounted a nervy man, a square man, anda white man.In all lands where life is a hazard lightly played with and lightlyflung aside, men turn, almost automatically, to gambling for diversionand relaxation.  In the Yukon men gambled their lives for gold, andthose that won gold from the ground gambled for it with one another.Nor was Elam Harnish an exception.  He was a man's man primarily, andthe instinct in him to play the game of life was strong.  Environmenthad determined what form that game should take.  He was born on an Iowafarm, and his father had emigrated to eastern Oregon, in which miningcountry Elam's boyhood was lived.  He had known nothing but hard knocksfor big stakes.  Pluck and endurance counted in the game, but the greatgod Chance dealt the cards.  Honest work for sure but meagre returnsdid not count.  A man played big.  He risked everything for everything,and anything less than everything meant that he was a loser.  So fortwelve Yukon years, Elam Harnish had been a loser.  True, on MoosehideCreek the past summer he had taken out twenty thousand dollars, andwhat was left in the ground was twenty thousand more.  But, as hehimself proclaimed, that was no more than getting his ante back.  Hehad ante'd his life for a dozen years, and forty thousand was a smallpot for such a stake--the price of a drink and a dance at the Tivoli,of a winter's flutter at Circle City, and a grubstake for the year tocome.The men of the Yukon reversed the old maxim till it read: hard come,easy go.  At the end of the reel, Elam Harnish called the house up todrink again.  Drinks were a dollar apiece, gold rated at sixteendollars an ounce; there were thirty in the house that accepted hisinvitation, and between every dance the house was Elam's guest.  Thiswas his night, and nobody was to be allowed to pay for anything.Not that Elam Harnish was a drinking man.  Whiskey meant little to him.He was too vital and robust, too untroubled in mind and body, toincline to the slavery of alcohol.  He spent months at a time on trailand river when he drank nothing stronger than coffee, while he had gonea year at a time without even coffee. But he was gregarious, and sincethe sole social expression of the Yukon was the saloon, he expressedhimself that way.  When he was a lad in the mining camps of the West,men had always done that.  To him it was the proper way for a man toexpress himself socially.  He knew no other way.He was a striking figure of a man, despite his garb being similar tothat of all the men in the Tivoli.  Soft-tanned moccasins ofmoose-hide, beaded in Indian designs, covered his feet.  His trouserswere ordinary overalls, his coat was made from a blanket.Long-gauntleted leather mittens, lined with wool, hung by his side.They were connected in the Yukon fashion, by a leather thong passedaround the neck and across the shoulders. On his head was a fur cap,the ear-flaps raised and the tying-cords dangling.  His face, lean andslightly long, with the suggestion of hollows under the cheek-bones,seemed almost Indian.  The burnt skin and keen dark eyes contributed tothis effect, though the bronze of the skin and the eyes themselves wereessentially those of a white man.  He looked older than thirty, andyet, smooth-shaven and without wrinkles, he was almost boyish.  Thisimpression of age was based on no tangible evidence.  It came from theabstracter facts of the man, from what he had endured and survived,which was far beyond that of ordinary men.  He had lived life naked andtensely, and something of all this smouldered in his eyes, vibrated inhis voice, and seemed forever a-whisper on his lips.The lips themselves were thin, and prone to close tightly over theeven, white teeth.  But their harshness was retrieved by the upwardcurl at the corners of his mouth.  This curl gave to him sweetness, asthe minute puckers at the corners of the eyes gave him laughter.  Thesenecessary graces saved him from a nature that was essentially savageand that otherwise would have been cruel and bitter.  The nose waslean, full-nostrilled, and delicate, and of a size to fit the face;while the high forehead, as if to atone for its narrowness, wassplendidly domed and symmetrical.  In line with the Indian effect washis hair, very straight and very black, with a gloss to it that onlyhealth could give."Burning Daylight's burning candlelight," laughed Dan MacDonald, as anoutburst of exclamations and merriment came from the dancers."An' he is der boy to do it, eh, Louis?" said Olaf Henderson."Yes, by Gar! you bet on dat," said French Louis.  "Dat boy is allgold--""And when God Almighty washes Daylight's soul out on the last bigslucin' day," MacDonald interrupted, "why, God Almighty'll have toshovel gravel along with him into the sluice-boxes.""Dot iss goot," Olaf Henderson muttered, regarding the gambler withprofound admiration."Ver' good," affirmed French Louis.  "I t'ink we take a drink on datone time, eh?"CHAPTER IIIt was two in the morning when the dancers, bent on getting somethingto eat, adjourned the dancing for half an hour.  And it was at thismoment that Jack Kearns suggested poker.  Jack Kearns was a big,bluff-featured man, who, along with Bettles, had made the disastrousattempt to found a post on the head-reaches of the Koyokuk, far insidethe Arctic Circle.  After that, Kearns had fallen back on his posts atForty Mile and Sixty Mile and changed the direction of his ventures bysending out to the States for a small sawmill and a river steamer.  Theformer was even then being sledded across Chilcoot Pass by Indians anddogs, and would come down the Yukon in the early summer after theice-run.  Later in the summer, when Bering Sea and the mouth of theYukon cleared of ice, the steamer, put together at St. Michaels, was tobe expected up the river loaded to the guards with supplies.Jack Kearns suggested poker.  French Louis, Dan MacDonald, and HalCampbell (who had make a strike on Moosehide), all three of whom werenot dancing because there were not girls enough to go around, inclinedto the suggestion.  They were looking for a fifth man when BurningDaylight emerged from the rear room, the Virgin on his arm, the trainof dancers in his wake.  In response to the hail of the poker-players,he came over to their table in the corner."Want you to sit in," said Campbell.  "How's your luck?""I sure got it to-night," Burning Daylight answered with enthusiasm,and at the same time felt the Virgin press his arm warningly.  Shewanted him for the dancing.  "I sure got my luck with me, but I'dsooner dance.  I ain't hankerin' to take the money away from you-all."Nobody urged.  They took his refusal as final, and the Virgin waspressing his arm to turn him away in pursuit of the supper-seekers,when he experienced a change of heart.  It was not that he did not wantto dance, nor that he wanted to hurt her; but that insistent pressureon his arm put his free man-nature in revolt.  The thought in his mindwas that he did not want any woman running him.  Himself a favoritewith women, nevertheless they did not bulk big with him.  They weretoys, playthings, part of the relaxation from the bigger game of life.He met women along with the whiskey and gambling, and from observationhe had found that it was far easier to break away from the drink andthe cards than from a woman once the man was properly entangled.He was a slave to himself, which was natural in one with a healthy ego,but he rebelled in ways either murderous or panicky at being a slave toanybody else.  Love's sweet servitude was a thing of which he had nocomprehension.  Men he had seen in love impressed him as lunatics, andlunacy was a thing he had never considered worth analyzing.  Butcomradeship with men was different from love with women.  There was noservitude in comradeship.  It was a business proposition, a square dealbetween men who did not pursue each other, but who shared the risks oftrail and river and mountain in the pursuit of life and treasure.  Menand women pursued each other, and one must needs bend the other to hiswill or hers.  Comradeship was different. There was no slavery aboutit; and though he, a strong man beyond strength's seeming, gave farmore than he received, he gave not something due but in royal largess,his gifts of toil or heroic effort falling generously from his hands.To pack for days over the gale-swept passes or across themosquito-ridden marshes, and to pack double the weight his comradepacked, did not involve unfairness or compulsion.  Each did his best.That was the business essence of it.  Some men were stronger thanothers--true; but so long as each man did his best it was fairexchange, the business spirit was observed, and the square dealobtained.But with women--no.  Women gave little and wanted all.  Women hadapron-strings and were prone to tie them about any man who looked twicein their direction.  There was the Virgin, yawning her head off when hecame in and mightily pleased that he asked her to dance.  One dance wasall very well, but because he danced twice and thrice with her andseveral times more, she squeezed his arm when they asked him to sit inat poker.  It was the obnoxious apron-string, the first of the manycompulsions she would exert upon him if he gave in.  Not that she wasnot a nice bit of a woman, healthy and strapping and good to look upon,also a very excellent dancer, but that she was a woman with all awoman's desire to rope him with her apron-strings and tie him hand andfoot for the branding.  Better poker.  Besides, he liked poker as wellas he did dancing.He resisted the pull on his arm by the mere negative mass of him, andsaid:--"I sort of feel a hankering to give you-all a flutter."Again came the pull on his arm.  She was trying to pass theapron-string around him.  For the fraction of an instant he was asavage, dominated by the wave of fear and murder that rose up in him.For that infinitesimal space of time he was to all purposes afrightened tiger filled with rage and terror at the apprehension of thetrap.  Had he been no more than a savage, he would have leapt wildlyfrom the place or else sprung upon her and destroyed her.  But in thatsame instant there stirred in him the generations of discipline bywhich man had become an inadequate social animal.  Tact and sympathystrove with him, and he smiled with his eyes into the Virgin's eyes ashe said:--"You-all go and get some grub.  I ain't hungry.  And we'll dance somemore by and by.  The night's young yet.  Go to it, old girl."He released his arm and thrust her playfully on the shoulder, at thesame time turning to the poker-players."Take off the limit and I'll go you-all.""Limit's the roof," said Jack Kearns."Take off the roof."The players glanced at one another, and Kearns announced, "The roof'soff."Elam Harnish dropped into the waiting chair, started to pull out hisgold-sack, and changed his mind.  The Virgin pouted a moment, thenfollowed in the wake of the other dancers."I'll bring you a sandwich, Daylight," she called back over hershoulder.He nodded.  She was smiling her forgiveness.  He had escaped theapron-string, and without hurting her feelings too severely."Let's play markers," he suggested.  "Chips do everlastingly clutter upthe table....If it's agreeable to you-all?""I'm willing," answered Hal Campbell.  "Let mine run at five hundred.""Mine, too," answered Harnish, while the others stated the values theyput on their own markers, French Louis, the most modest, issuing his ata hundred dollars each.In Alaska, at that time, there were no rascals and no tin-horngamblers.  Games were conducted honestly, and men trusted one another.A man's word was as good as his gold in the blower.  A marker was aflat, oblong composition chip worth, perhaps, a cent.  But when a manbetted a marker in a game and said it was worth five hundred dollars,it was accepted as worth five hundred dollars.  Whoever won it knewthat the man who issued it would redeem it with five hundred dollars'worth of dust weighed out on the scales.  The markers being ofdifferent colors, there was no difficulty in identifying the owners.Also, in that early Yukon day, no one dreamed of playing table-stakes.A man was good in a game for all that he possessed, no matter where hispossessions were or what was their nature.Harnish cut and got the deal.  At this good augury, and while shufflingthe deck, he called to the barkeepers to set up the drinks for thehouse.  As he dealt the first card to Dan MacDonald, on his left, hecalled out:"Get down to the ground, you-all, Malemutes, huskies, and Siwash purps!Get down and dig in!  Tighten up them traces!  Put your weight into theharness and bust the breast-bands!  Whoop-la! Yow!  We're off and boundfor Helen Breakfast!  And I tell you-all clear and plain there's goin'to be stiff grades and fast goin' to-night before we win to that samelady.  And somebody's goin' to bump...hard."Once started, it was a quiet game, with little or no conversation,though all about the players the place was a-roar. Elam Harnish hadignited the spark.  More and more miners dropped in to the Tivoli andremained.  When Burning Daylight went on the tear, no man cared to missit.  The dancing-floor was full. Owing to the shortage of women, manyof the men tied bandanna handkerchiefs around their arms in token offemininity and danced with other men.  All the games were crowded, andthe voices of the men talking at the long bar and grouped about thestove were accompanied by the steady click of chips and the sharp whir,rising and falling, of the roulette-ball.  All the materials of aproper Yukon night were at hand and mixing.The luck at the table varied monotonously, no big hands being out.  Asa result, high play went on with small hands though no play lastedlong.  A filled straight belonging to French Louis gave him a pot offive thousand against two sets of threes held by Campbell and Kearns.One pot of eight hundred dollars was won by a pair of treys on ashowdown.  And once Harnish called Kearns for two thousand dollars on acold steal.  When Kearns laid down his hand it showed a bobtail flush,while Harnish's hand proved that he had had the nerve to call on a pairof tens.But at three in the morning the big combination of hands arrived.It was the moment of moments that men wait weeks for in a poker game.The news of it tingled over the Tivoli.  The onlookers became quiet.The men farther away ceased talking and moved over to the table.  Theplayers deserted the other games, and the dancing-floor was forsaken,so that all stood at last, fivescore and more, in a compact and silentgroup, around the poker-table. The high betting had begun before thedraw, and still the high betting went on, with the draw not in sight.Kearns had dealt, and French Louis had opened the pot with onemarker--in his case one hundred dollars.  Campbell had merely "seen"it, but Elam Harnish, corning next, had tossed in five hundred dollars,with the remark to MacDonald that he was letting him in easy.MacDonald, glancing again at his hand, put in a thousand in markers.Kearns, debating a long time over his hand, finally "saw."  It thencost French Louis nine hundred to remain in the game, which hecontributed after a similar debate.  It cost Campbell likewise ninehundred to remain and draw cards, but to the surprise of all he saw thenine hundred and raised another thousand."You-all are on the grade at last," Harnish remarked, as he saw thefifteen hundred and raised a thousand in turn.  "Helen Breakfast's sureon top this divide, and you-all had best look out for bustin' harness.""Me for that same lady," accompanied MacDonald's markers for twothousand and for an additional thousand-dollar raise.It was at this stage that the players sat up and knew beyondperadventure that big hands were out.  Though their features showednothing, each man was beginning unconsciously to tense. Each man stroveto appear his natural self, and each natural self was different.  HalCampbell affected his customary cautiousness.French Louis betrayed interest.  MacDonald retained his whole-souledbenevolence, though it seemed to take on a slightly exaggerated tone.Kearns was coolly dispassionate and noncommittal, while Elam Harnishappeared as quizzical and jocular as ever.  Eleven thousand dollarswere already in the pot, and the markers were heaped in a confused pilein the centre of the table."I ain't go no more markers," Kearns remarked plaintively.  "We'd bestbegin I.O.U.'s.""Glad you're going to stay," was MacDonald's cordial response."I ain't stayed yet.  I've got a thousand in already.  How's it standnow?""It'll cost you three thousand for a look in, but nobody will stop youfrom raising.""Raise--hell.  You must think I got a pat like yourself." Kearns lookedat his hand.  "But I'll tell you what I'll do, Mac."I've got a hunch, and I'll just see that three thousand."He wrote the sum on a slip of paper, signed his name, and consigned itto the centre of the table.French Louis became the focus of all eyes.  He fingered his cardsnervously for a space.  Then, with a "By Gar!  Ah got not one leetlebeet hunch," he regretfully tossed his hand into the discards.The next moment the hundred and odd pairs of eyes shifted to Campbell."I won't hump you, Jack," he said, contenting himself with calling therequisite two thousand.The eyes shifted to Harnish, who scribbled on a piece of paper andshoved it forward."I'll just let you-all know this ain't no Sunday-school society ofphilanthropy," he said.  "I see you, Jack, and I raise you a thousand.Here's where you-all get action on your pat, Mac.""Action's what I fatten on, and I lift another thousand," wasMacDonald's rejoinder.  "Still got that hunch, Jack?""I still got the hunch."  Kearns fingered his cards a long time.  "AndI'll play it, but you've got to know how I stand. There's my steamer,the Bella--worth twenty thousand if she's worth an ounce.  There'sSixty Mile with five thousand in stock on the shelves.  And you know Igot a sawmill coming in.  It's at Linderman now, and the scow isbuilding.  Am I good?""Dig in; you're sure good," was Daylight's answer.  "And while we'reabout it, I may mention casual that I got twenty thousand in Mac'ssafe, there, and there's twenty thousand more in the ground onMoosehide.  You know the ground, Campbell.  Is they that-all in thedirt?""There sure is, Daylight.""How much does it cost now?" Kearns asked."Two thousand to see.""We'll sure hump you if you-all come in," Daylight warned him."It's an almighty good hunch," Kearns said, adding his slip for twothousand to the growing heap.  "I can feel her crawlin' up and down myback.""I ain't got a hunch, but I got a tolerable likeable hand," Campbellannounced, as he slid in his slip; "but it's not a raising hand.""Mine is," Daylight paused and wrote.  "I see that thousand and raiseher the same old thousand."The Virgin, standing behind him, then did what a man's best friend wasnot privileged to do.  Reaching over Daylight's shoulder, she picked uphis hand and read it, at the same time shielding the faces of the fivecards close to his chest.  What she saw were three queens and a pair ofeights, but nobody guessed what she saw.  Every player's eyes were onher face as she scanned the cards, but no sign did she give.  Herfeatures might have been carved from ice, for her expression wasprecisely the same before, during, and after.  Not a muscle quivered;nor was there the slightest dilation of a nostril, nor the slightestincrease of light in the eyes.  She laid the hand face down again onthe table, and slowly the lingering eyes withdrew from her, havinglearned nothing.MacDonald smiled benevolently.  "I see you, Daylight, and I hump thistime for two thousand.  How's that hunch, Jack?""Still a-crawling, Mac.  You got me now, but that hunch is arip-snorter persuadin' sort of a critter, and it's my plain duty toride it.  I call for three thousand.  And I got another hunch:Daylight's going to call, too.""He sure is," Daylight agreed, after Campbell had thrown up his hand."He knows when he's up against it, and he plays accordin'. I see thattwo thousand, and then I'll see the draw."In a dead silence, save for the low voices of the three players, thedraw was made.  Thirty-four thousand dollars were already in the pot,and the play possibly not half over.  To the Virgin's amazement,Daylight held up his three queens, discarding his eights and callingfor two cards.  And this time not even she dared look at what he haddrawn.  She knew her limit of control. Nor did he look.  The two newcards lay face down on the table where they had been dealt to him."Cards?" Kearns asked of MacDonald."Got enough," was the reply."You can draw if you want to, you know," Kearns warned him."Nope; this'll do me."Kearns himself drew two cards, but did not look at them.Still Harnish let his cards lie."I never bet in the teeth of a pat hand," he said slowly, looking atthe saloon-keeper.  "You-all start her rolling, Mac."MacDonald counted his cards carefully, to make double sure it was not afoul hand, wrote a sum on a paper slip, and slid it into the pot, withthe simple utterance:--"Five thousand."Kearns, with every eye upon him, looked at his two-card draw, countedthe other three to dispel any doubt of holding more than five cards,and wrote on a betting slip."I see you, Mac," he said, "and I raise her a little thousand just soas not to keep Daylight out."The concentrated gaze shifted to Daylight.  He likewise examined hisdraw and counted his five cards."I see that six thousand, and I raise her five thousand...just to tryand keep you out, Jack.""And I raise you five thousand just to lend a hand at keeping Jackout," MacDonald said, in turn.His voice was slightly husky and strained, and a nervous twitch in thecorner of his mouth followed speech.Kearns was pale, and those who looked on noted that his hand trembledas he wrote his slip.  But his voice was unchanged."I lift her along for five thousand," he said.Daylight was now the centre.  The kerosene lamps above flung highlights from the rash of sweat on his forehead.  The bronze of hischeeks was darkened by the accession of blood.  His black eyesglittered, and his nostrils were distended and eager.  They were largenostrils, tokening his descent from savage ancestors who had survivedby virtue of deep lungs and generous air-passages. Yet, unlikeMacDonald, his voice was firm and customary, and, unlike Kearns, hishand did not tremble when he wrote."I call, for ten thousand," he said.  "Not that I'm afraid of you-all,Mac.  It's that hunch of Jack's.""I hump his hunch for five thousand just the same," said MacDonald.  "Ihad the best hand before the draw, and I still guess I got it.""Mebbe this is a case where a hunch after the draw is better'n thehunch before," Kearns remarked; "wherefore duty says, 'Lift her, Jack,lift her,' and so I lift her another five thousand."Daylight leaned back in his chair and gazed up at the kerosene lampswhile he computed aloud."I was in nine thousand before the draw, and I saw and raised eleventhousand--that makes thirty.  I'm only good for ten more."He leaned forward and looked at Kearns.  "So I call that ten thousand.""You can raise if you want," Kearns answered.  "Your dogs are good forfive thousand in this game.""Nary dawg.  You-all can win my dust and dirt, but nary one of mydawgs.  I just call."MacDonald considered for a long time.  No one moved or whispered.Not a muscle was relaxed on the part of the onlookers.  Not the weightof a body shifted from one leg to the other.  It was a sacred silence.Only could be heard the roaring draft of the huge stove, and fromwithout, muffled by the log-walls, the howling of dogs.  It was notevery night that high stakes were played on the Yukon, and for thatmatter, this was the highest in the history of the country.  Thesaloon-keeper finally spoke."If anybody else wins, they'll have to take a mortgage on the Tivoli."The two other players nodded."So I call, too."  MacDonald added his slip for five thousand.Not one of them claimed the pot, and not one of them called the size ofhis hand.  Simultaneously and in silence they faced their cards on thetable, while a general tiptoeing and craning of necks took place amongthe onlookers.  Daylight showed four queens and an ace; MacDonald fourjacks and an ace; and Kearns four kings and a trey.  Kearns reachedforward with an encircling movement of his arm and drew the pot in tohim, his arm shaking as he did so.Daylight picked the ace from his hand and tossed it over alongsideMacDonald's ace, saying:--"That's what cheered me along, Mac.  I knowed it was only kings thatcould beat me, and he had them."What did you-all have?" he asked, all interest, turning to Campbell."Straight flush of four, open at both ends--a good drawing hand.""You bet! You could a' made a straight, a straight flush, or a flushout of it.""That's what I thought," Campbell said sadly.  "It cost me six thousandbefore I quit.""I wisht you-all'd drawn," Daylight laughed.  "Then I wouldn't a'caught that fourth queen.  Now I've got to take Billy Rawlins' mailcontract and mush for Dyea.  What's the size of the killing, Jack?"Kearns attempted to count the pot, but was too excited.  Daylight drewit across to him, with firm fingers separating and stacking the markersand I.O.U.'s and with clear brain adding the sum."One hundred and twenty-seven thousand," he announced.  "You-all cansell out now, Jack, and head for home."The winner smiled and nodded, but seemed incapable of speech."I'd shout the drinks," MacDonald said, "only the house don't belong tome any more.""Yes, it does," Kearns replied, first wetting his lips with his tongue."Your note's good for any length of time.  But the drinks are on me.""Name your snake-juice, you-all--the winner pays!" Daylight called outloudly to all about him, at the same time rising from his chair andcatching the Virgin by the arm.  "Come on for a reel, you-all dancers.The night's young yet, and it's Helen Breakfast and the mail contractfor me in the morning.  Here, you-all Rawlins, you--I hereby do takeover that same contract, and I start for salt water at nineA.M.--savvee?  Come on, you-all!  Where's that fiddler?"CHAPTER IIIIt was Daylight's night.  He was the centre and the head of the revel,unquenchably joyous, a contagion of fun.  He multiplied himself, and inso doing multiplied the excitement.  No prank he suggested was too wildfor his followers, and all followed save those that developed intosinging imbeciles and fell warbling by the wayside.  Yet never didtrouble intrude.  It was known on the Yukon that when Burning Daylightmade a night of it, wrath and evil were forbidden.  On his nights mendared not quarrel.  In the younger days such things had happened, andthen men had known what real wrath was, and been man-handled as onlyBurning Daylight could man-handle.  On his nights men must laugh and behappy or go home.  Daylight was inexhaustible.  In between dances hepaid over to Kearns the twenty thousand in dust and transferred to himhis Moosehide claim.  Likewise he arranged the taking over of BillyRawlins' mail contract, and made his preparations for the start.  Hedespatched a messenger to rout out Kama, his dog-driver--a TananawIndian, far-wandered from his tribal home in the service of theinvading whites.  Kama entered the Tivoli, tall, lean, muscular, andfur-clad, the pick of his barbaric race and barbaric still, unshakenand unabashed by the revellers that rioted about him while Daylightgave his orders. "Um," said Kama, tabling his instructions on hisfingers.  "Get um letters from Rawlins.  Load um on sled.  Grub forSelkirk--you think um plenty dog-grub stop Selkirk?""Plenty dog-grub, Kama.""Um, bring sled this place nine um clock.  Bring um snowshoes. No bringum tent.  Mebbe bring um fly?  um little fly?""No fly," Daylight answered decisively."Um much cold.""We travel light--savvee?  We carry plenty letters out, plenty lettersback.  You are strong man.  Plenty cold, plenty travel, all right.""Sure all right," Kama muttered, with resignation."Much cold, no care a damn.  Um ready nine um clock."He turned on his moccasined heel and walked out, imperturbable,sphinx-like, neither giving nor receiving greetings nor looking toright or left.  The Virgin led Daylight away into a corner."Look here, Daylight," she said, in a low voice, "you're busted.""Higher'n a kite.""I've eight thousand in Mac's safe--" she began.But Daylight interrupted.  The apron-string loomed near and he shiedlike an unbroken colt."It don't matter," he said.  "Busted I came into the world, busted I goout, and I've been busted most of the time since I arrived.  Come on;let's waltz.""But listen," she urged.  "My money's doing nothing.  I could lend itto you--a grub-stake," she added hurriedly, at sight of the alarm inhis face."Nobody grub-stakes me," was the answer.  "I stake myself, and when Imake a killing it's sure all mine.  No thank you, old girl.  Muchobliged.  I'll get my stake by running the mail out and in.""Daylight," she murmured, in tender protest.But with a sudden well-assumed ebullition of spirits he drew her towardthe dancing-floor, and as they swung around and around in a waltz shepondered on the iron heart of the man who held her in his arms andresisted all her wiles.At six the next morning, scorching with whiskey, yet ever himself, hestood at the bar putting every man's hand down.  The way of it was thattwo men faced each other across a corner, their right elbows resting onthe bar, their right hands gripped together, while each strove to pressthe other's hand down.  Man after man came against him, but no man puthis hand down, even Olaf Henderson and French Louis failing despitetheir hugeness. When they contended it was a trick, a trained muscularknack, he challenged them to another test."Look here, you-all" he cried.  "I'm going to do two things: first,weigh my sack; and second, bet it that after you-all have lifted cleanfrom the floor all the sacks of flour you-all are able, I'll put on twomore sacks and lift the whole caboodle clean.""By Gar! Ah take dat!" French Louis rumbled above the cheers."Hold on!" Olaf Henderson cried.  "I ban yust as good as you, Louis.  Iyump half that bet."Put on the scales, Daylight's sack was found to balance an even fourhundred dollars, and Louis and Olaf divided the bet between them.Fifty-pound sacks of flour were brought in from MacDonald's cache.Other men tested their strength first.  They straddled on two chairs,the flour sacks beneath them on the floor and held together byrope-lashings.  Many of the men were able, in this manner, to lift fouror five hundred pounds, while some succeeded with as high as sixhundred.  Then the two giants took a hand, tying at seven hundred.French Louis then added another sack, and swung seven hundred and fiftyclear.  Olaf duplicated the performance, whereupon both failed to cleareight hundred.  Again and again they strove, their foreheads beadedwith sweat, their frames crackling with the effort.  Both were able toshift the weight and to bump it, but clear the floor with it they couldnot."By Gar! Daylight, dis tam you mek one beeg meestake," French Louissaid, straightening up and stepping down from the chairs. "Only onedamn iron man can do dat.  One hundred pun' more--my frien', not tenpoun' more."  The sacks were unlashed, but when two sacks were added,Kearns interfered.  "Only one sack more.""Two!" some one cried.  "Two was the bet.""They didn't lift that last sack," Kearns protested."They only lifted seven hundred and fifty."But Daylight grandly brushed aside the confusion."What's the good of you-all botherin' around that way?  What's one moresack?  If I can't lift three more, I sure can't lift two.  Put 'em in."He stood upon the chairs, squatted, and bent his shoulders down tillhis hands closed on the rope.  He shifted his feet slightly, tautenedhis muscles with a tentative pull, then relaxed again, questing for aperfect adjustment of all the levers of his body.French Louis, looking on sceptically, cried out,"Pool lak hell, Daylight!  Pool lak hell!"Daylight's muscles tautened a second time, and this time in earnest,until steadily all the energy of his splendid body was applied, andquite imperceptibly, without jerk or strain, the bulky nine hundredpounds rose from the door and swung back and forth, pendulum like,between his legs.Olaf Henderson sighed a vast audible sigh.  The Virgin, who had tensedunconsciously till her muscles hurt her, relaxed.  While French Louismurmured reverently:--"M'sieu Daylight, salut!  Ay am one beeg baby.  You are one beeg man."Daylight dropped his burden, leaped to the floor, and headed for thebar."Weigh in!" he cried, tossing his sack to the weigher, who transferredto it four hundred dollars from the sacks of the two losers."Surge up, everybody!" Daylight went on.  "Name your snake-juice! Thewinner pays!""This is my night!" he was shouting, ten minutes later.  "I'm the lonehe-wolf, and I've seen thirty winters.  This is my birthday, my one dayin the year, and I can put any man on his back.  Come on, you-all!  I'mgoing to put you-all in the snow. Come on, you chechaquos [1] andsourdoughs[2], and get your baptism!"The rout streamed out of doors, all save the barkeepers and the singingBacchuses.  Some fleeting thought of saving his own dignity enteredMacDonald's head, for he approached Daylight with outstretched hand."What?  You first?" Daylight laughed, clasping the other's hand as ifin greeting."No, no," the other hurriedly disclaimed.  "Just congratulations onyour birthday.  Of course you can put me in the snow.  What chance haveI against a man that lifts nine hundred pounds?"MacDonald weighed one hundred and eighty pounds, and Daylight had himgripped solely by his hand; yet, by a sheer abrupt jerk, he took thesaloon-keeper off his feet and flung him face downward in the snow.  Inquick succession, seizing the men nearest him, he threw half a dozenmore.  Resistance was useless.  They flew helter-skelter out of hisgrips, landing in all manner of attitudes, grotesquely and harmlessly,in the soft snow.  It soon became difficult, in the dim starlight, todistinguish between those thrown and those waiting their turn, and hebegan feeling their backs and shoulders, determining their status bywhether or not he found them powdered with snow."Baptized yet?" became his stereotyped question, as he reached out histerrible hands.Several score lay down in the snow in a long row, while many othersknelt in mock humility, scooping snow upon their heads and claiming therite accomplished.  But a group of five stood upright, backwoodsmen andfrontiersmen, they, eager to contest any man's birthday.Graduates of the hardest of man-handling schools, veterans ofmultitudes of rough-and-tumble battles, men of blood and sweat andendurance, they nevertheless lacked one thing that Daylight possessedin high degree--namely, an almost perfect brain and muscularcoordination.  It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.  He hadbeen born with this endowment.  His nerves carried messages morequickly than theirs; his mental processes, culminating in acts of will,were quicker than theirs; his muscles themselves, by some immediacy ofchemistry, obeyed the messages of his will quicker than theirs.  He wasso made, his muscles were high-power explosives.  The levers of hisbody snapped into play like the jaws of steel traps.  And in additionto all this, his was that super-strength that is the dower of but onehuman in millions--a strength depending not on size but on degree, asupreme organic excellence residing in the stuff of the musclesthemselves.  Thus, so swiftly could he apply a stress, that, before anopponent could become aware and resist, the aim of the stress had beenaccomplished.  In turn, so swiftly did he become aware of a stressapplied to him, that he saved himself by resistance or by delivering alightning counter-stress."It ain't no use you-all standing there," Daylight addressed thewaiting group.  "You-all might as well get right down and take yourbaptizing.  You-all might down me any other day in the year, but on mybirthday I want you-all to know I'm the best man.  Is that PatHanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing?  Come on, Pat."  PatHanrahan, ex-bare-knuckle-prize fighter and roughhouse-expert, steppedforth.  The two men came against each other in grips, and almost beforehe had exerted himself the Irishman found himself in the merciless viseof a half-Nelson that buried him head and shoulders in the snow.  JoeHines, ex-lumber-jack, came down with an impact equal to a fall from atwo-story building--his overthrow accomplished by a cross-buttock,delivered, he claimed, before he was ready.There was nothing exhausting in all this to Daylight.  He did not heaveand strain through long minutes.  No time, practically, was occupied.His body exploded abruptly and terrifically in one instant, and on thenext instant was relaxed.  Thus, Doc Watson, the gray-bearded, ironbodied man without a past, a fighting terror himself, was overthrown inthe fraction of a second preceding his own onslaught.  As he was in theact of gathering himself for a spring, Daylight was upon him, and withsuch fearful suddenness as to crush him backward and down.  OlafHenderson, receiving his cue from this, attempted to take Daylightunaware, rushing upon him from one side as he stooped with extendedhand to help Doc Watson up.  Daylight dropped on his hands and knees,receiving in his side Olaf's knees.  Olaf's momentum carried him clearover the obstruction in a long, flying fall.  Before he could rise,Daylight had whirled him over on his back and was rubbing his face andears with snow and shoving handfuls down his neck.  "Ay ban yust asgood a man as you ban, Daylight," Olaf spluttered, as he pulled himselfto his feet; "but by Yupiter, I ban navver see a grip like that."French Louis was the last of the five, and he had seen enough to makehim cautious.  He circled and baffled for a full minute before comingto grips; and for another full minute they strained and reeled withouteither winning the advantage.  And then, just as the contest wasbecoming interesting, Daylight effected one of his lightning shifts,changing all stresses and leverages and at the same time delivering oneof his muscular explosions.  French Louis resisted till his huge framecrackled, and then, slowly, was forced over and under and downward."The winner pays!" Daylight cried; as he sprang to his feet and led theway back into the Tivoli.  "Surge along you-all! This way to thesnake-room!"They lined up against the long bar, in places two or three deep,stamping the frost from their moccasined feet, for outside thetemperature was sixty below.  Bettles, himself one of the gamest of theold-timers in deeds and daring ceased from his drunken lay of the"Sassafras Root," and titubated over to congratulate Daylight.  But inthe midst of it he felt impelled to make a speech, and raised his voiceoratorically."I tell you fellers I'm plum proud to call Daylight my friend. We'vehit the trail together afore now, and he's eighteen carat from hismoccasins up, damn his mangy old hide, anyway.  He was a shaver when hefirst hit this country.  When you fellers was his age, you wa'n't drybehind the ears yet.  He never was no kid. He was born a full-grownman.  An' I tell you a man had to be a man in them days.  This wa'n'tno effete civilization like it's come to be now."  Bettles paused longenough to put his arm in a proper bear-hug around Daylight's neck."When you an' me mushed into the Yukon in the good ole days, it didn'train soup and they wa'n't no free-lunch joints.  Our camp fires was litwhere we killed our game, and most of the time we lived onsalmon-tracks and rabbit-bellies--ain't I right?"But at the roar of laughter that greeted his inversion, Bettlesreleased the bear-hug and turned fiercely on them.  "Laugh, you mangyshort-horns, laugh!  But I tell you plain and simple, the best of youain't knee-high fit to tie Daylight's moccasin strings."Ain't I right, Campbell?  Ain't I right, Mac?  Daylight's one of theold guard, one of the real sour-doughs.  And in them days they wa'n'tary a steamboat or ary a trading-post, and we cusses had to live offensalmon-bellies and rabbit-tracks."He gazed triumphantly around, and in the applause that followed arosecries for a speech from Daylight.  He signified his consent.  A chairwas brought, and he was helped to stand upon it.  He was no more soberthan the crowd above which he now towered--a wild crowd, uncouthlygarmented, every foot moccasined or muc-lucked[3], with mittensdangling from necks and with furry ear-flaps raised so that they tookon the seeming of the winged helmets of the Norsemen.  Daylight's blackeyes were flashing, and the flush of strong drink flooded darkly underthe bronze of his cheeks.  He was greeted with round on round ofaffectionate cheers, which brought a suspicious moisture to his eyes,albeit many of the voices were inarticulate and inebriate.  And yet,men have so behaved since the world began, feasting, fighting, andcarousing, whether in the dark cave-mouth or by the fire of thesquatting-place, in the palaces of imperial Rome and the rockstrongholds of robber barons, or in the sky-aspiring hotels of moderntimes and in the boozing-dens of sailor-town.  Just so were these men,empire-builders in the Arctic Light, boastful and drunken andclamorous, winning surcease for a few wild moments from the grimreality of their heroic toil.  Modern heroes they, and in nowisedifferent from the heroes of old time.  "Well, fellows, I don't knowwhat to say to you-all," Daylight began lamely, striving still tocontrol his whirling brain.  "I think I'll tell you-all a story.  I hada pardner wunst, down in Juneau.  He come from North Caroliney, and heused to tell this same story to me.  It was down in the mountains inhis country, and it was a wedding.  There they was, the family and allthe friends.  The parson was just puttin' on the last touches, and hesays, 'They as the Lord have joined let no man put asunder.'"'Parson,' says the bridegroom, 'I rises to question your grammar inthat there sentence.  I want this weddin' done right.'"When the smoke clears away, the bride she looks around and sees a deadparson, a dead bridegroom, a dead brother, two dead uncles, and fivedead wedding-guests."So she heaves a mighty strong sigh and says, 'Them new-fangled,self-cocking revolvers sure has played hell with my prospects.'"And so I say to you-all," Daylight added, as the roar of laughter dieddown, "that them four kings of Jack Kearns sure has played hell with myprospects.  I'm busted higher'n a kite, and I'm hittin' the trail forDyea--""Goin' out?" some one called.  A spasm of anger wrought on his face fora flashing instant, but in the next his good-humor was back again."I know you-all are only pokin' fun asking such a question," he said,with a smile.  "Of course I ain't going out.""Take the oath again, Daylight," the same voice cried."I sure will.  I first come over Chilcoot in '83.  I went out over thePass in a fall blizzard, with a rag of a shirt and a cup of raw flour.I got my grub-stake in Juneau that winter, and in the spring I wentover the Pass once more.  And once more the famine drew me out.  Nextspring I went in again, and I swore then that I'd never come out till Imade my stake.  Well, I ain't made it, and here I am.  And I ain'tgoing out now.  I get the mail and I come right back.  I won't stop thenight at Dyea. I'll hit up Chilcoot soon as I change the dogs and getthe mail and grub.  And so I swear once more, by the mill-tails of helland the head of John the Baptist, I'll never hit for the Outside till Imake my pile.  And I tell you-all, here and now, it's got to be analmighty big pile.""How much might you call a pile?" Bettles demanded from beneath, hisarms clutched lovingly around Daylight's legs."Yes, how much?  What do you call a pile?" others cried.Daylight steadied himself for a moment and debated.  "Four or fivemillions," he said slowly, and held up his hand for silence as hisstatement was received with derisive yells.  "I'll be realconservative, and put the bottom notch at a million.  And for not anounce less'n that will I go out of the country."Again his statement was received with an outburst of derision. Not onlyhad the total gold output of the Yukon up to date been below fivemillions, but no man had ever made a strike of a hundred thousand, muchless of a million."You-all listen to me.  You seen Jack Kearns get a hunch to-night.  Wehad him sure beat before the draw.  His ornery three kings was no good.But he just knew there was another king coming--that was his hunch--andhe got it.  And I tell you-all I got a hunch.  There's a big strikecoming on the Yukon, and it's just about due.  I don't mean no orneryMoosehide, Birch-Creek kind of a strike.  I mean a real rip-snorterhair-raiser.  I tell you-all she's in the air and hell-bent forelection.  Nothing can stop her, and she'll come up river.  There'swhere you-all track my moccasins in the near future if you-all want tofind me--somewhere in the country around Stewart River, Indian River,and Klondike River.  When I get back with the mail, I'll head that wayso fast you-all won't see my trail for smoke.  She's a-coming, fellows,gold from the grass roots down, a hundred dollars to the pan, and astampede in from the Outside fifty thousand strong.  You-all'll thinkall hell's busted loose when that strike is made."He raised his glass to his lips.  "Here's kindness, and hoping you-allwill be in on it."He drank and stepped down from the chair, falling into another one ofBettles' bear-hugs."If I was you, Daylight, I wouldn't mush to-day," Joe Hines counselled,coming in from consulting the spirit thermometer outside the door."We're in for a good cold snap.  It's sixty-two below now, and stillgoin' down.  Better wait till she breaks."Daylight laughed, and the old sour-doughs around him laughed."Just like you short-horns," Bettles cried, "afeard of a little frost.And blamed little you know Daylight, if you think frost kin stop 'm.""Freeze his lungs if he travels in it," was the reply."Freeze pap and lollypop!  Look here, Hines, you only ben in this herecountry three years.  You ain't seasoned yet.  I've seen Daylight dofifty miles up on the Koyokuk on a day when the thermometer busted atseventy-two."Hines shook his head dolefully."Them's the kind that does freeze their lungs," he lamented.  "IfDaylight pulls out before this snap breaks, he'll never getthrough--an' him travelin' without tent or fly.""It's a thousand miles to Dyea," Bettles announced, climbing on thechair and supporting his swaying body by an arm passed aroundDaylight's neck.  "It's a thousand miles, I'm sayin' an' most of thetrail unbroke, but I bet any chechaquo--anything he wants--thatDaylight makes Dyea in thirty days.""That's an average of over thirty-three miles a day," Doc Watsonwarned, "and I've travelled some myself.  A blizzard on Chilcoot wouldtie him up for a week.""Yep," Bettles retorted, "an' Daylight'll do the second thousand backagain on end in thirty days more, and I got five hundred dollars thatsays so, and damn the blizzards."To emphasize his remarks, he pulled out a gold-sack the size of abologna sausage and thumped it down on the bar.  Doc Watson thumped hisown sack alongside."Hold on!" Daylight cried.  "Bettles's right, and I want in on this.  Ibet five hundred that sixty days from now I pull up at the Tivoli doorwith the Dyea mail."A sceptical roar went up, and a dozen men pulled out their sacks.Jack Kearns crowded in close and caught Daylight's attention."I take you, Daylight," he cried.  "Two to one you don't--not inseventy-five days.""No charity, Jack," was the reply.  "The bettin's even, and the time issixty days.""Seventy-five days, and two to one you don't," Kearns insisted. "FiftyMile'll be wide open and the rim-ice rotten.""What you win from me is yours," Daylight went on.  "And, by thunder,Jack, you can't give it back that way.  I won't bet with you.  You'retrying to give me money.  But I tell you-all one thing, Jack, I gotanother hunch.  I'm goin' to win it back some one of these days.You-all just wait till the big strike up river.  Then you and me'lltake the roof off and sit in a game that'll be full man's size.  Is ita go?"They shook hands."Of course he'll make it," Kearns whispered in Bettles' ear. "Andthere's five hundred Daylight's back in sixty days," he added aloud.Billy Rawlins closed with the wager, and Bettles hugged Kearnsecstatically."By Yupiter, I ban take that bet," Olaf Henderson said, draggingDaylight away from Bettles and Kearns."Winner pays!" Daylight shouted, closing the wager."And I'm sure going to win, and sixty days is a long time betweendrinks, so I pay now.  Name your brand, you hoochinoos!  Name yourbrand!"Bettles, a glass of whiskey in hand, climbed back on his chair, andswaying back and forth, sang the one song he knew:--   "O, it's Henry Ward Beecher   And Sunday-school teachers   All sing of the sassafras-root;   But you bet all the same,   If it had its right name   It's the juice of the forbidden fruit."The crowd roared out the chorus:--   "But you bet all the same   If it had its right name   It's the juice of the forbidden fruit."Somebody opened the outer door.  A vague gray light filtered in."Burning daylight, burning daylight," some one called warningly.Daylight paused for nothing, heading for the door and pulling down hisear-flaps.  Kama stood outside by the sled, a long, narrow affair,sixteen inches wide and seven and a half feet in length, its slattedbottom raised six inches above the steel-shod runners.  On it, lashedwith thongs of moose-hide, were the light canvas bags that containedthe mail, and the food and gear for dogs and men.  In front of it, in asingle line, lay curled five frost-rimed dogs.  They were huskies,matched in size and color, all unusually large and all gray.  Fromtheir cruel jaws to their bushy tails they were as like as peas intheir likeness to timber-wolves.  Wolves they were, domesticated, itwas true, but wolves in appearance and in all their characteristics.On top the sled load, thrust under the lashings and ready for immediateuse, were two pairs of snowshoes.Bettles pointed to a robe of Arctic hare skins, the end of which showedin the mouth of a bag."That's his bed," he said.  "Six pounds of rabbit skins.  Warmest thinghe ever slept under, but I'm damned if it could keep me warm, and I cango some myself.  Daylight's a hell-fire furnace, that's what he is.""I'd hate to be that Indian," Doc Watson remarked."He'll kill'm, he'll kill'm sure," Bettles chanted exultantly. "I know.I've ben with Daylight on trail.  That man ain't never ben tired in hislife.  Don't know what it means.  I seen him travel all day with wetsocks at forty-five below.  There ain't another man living can do that."While this talk went on, Daylight was saying good-by to those thatclustered around him.  The Virgin wanted to kiss him, and, fuddledslightly though he was with the whiskey, he saw his way out withoutcompromising with the apron-string.  He kissed the Virgin, but hekissed the other three women with equal partiality.  He pulled on hislong mittens, roused the dogs to their feet, and took his Place at thegee-pole.[4]"Mush, you beauties!" he cried.The animals threw their weights against their breastbands on theinstant, crouching low to the snow, and digging in their claws. Theywhined eagerly, and before the sled had gone half a dozen lengths bothDaylight and Kama (in the rear) were running to keep up.  And so,running, man and dogs dipped over the bank and down to the frozen bedof the Yukon, and in the gray light were gone.[1] Tenderfeet.[2] Old-timers.[3] Muc-luc: a water-tight, Eskimo boot, made from walrus-hide andtrimmed with fur.[4] A gee-pole: stout pole projecting forward from one side of thefront end of the sled, by which the sled is steered.CHAPTER IVOn the river, where was a packed trail and where snowshoes wereunnecessary, the dogs averaged six miles an hour.  To keep up withthem, the two men were compelled to run.  Daylight and Kama relievedeach other regularly at the gee-pole, for here was the hard work ofsteering the flying sled and of keeping in advance of it.  The manrelieved dropped behind the sled, occasionally leaping upon it andresting.It was severe work, but of the sort that was exhilarating.They were flying, getting over the ground, making the most of thepacked trail.  Later on they would come to the unbroken trail, wherethree miles an hour would constitute good going.  Then there would beno riding and resting, and no running.  Then the gee-pole would be theeasier task, and a man would come back to it to rest after havingcompleted his spell to the fore, breaking trail with the snowshoes forthe dogs.  Such work was far from exhilarating also, they must expectplaces where for miles at a time they must toil over chaotic ice-jams,where they would be fortunate if they made two miles an hour.  Andthere would be the inevitable bad jams, short ones, it was true, but sobad that a mile an hour would require terrific effort.  Kama andDaylight did not talk.  In the nature of the work they could not, norin their own natures were they given to talking while they worked. Atrare intervals, when necessary, they addressed each other inmonosyllables, Kama, for the most part, contenting himself with grunts.Occasionally a dog whined or snarled, but in the main the team keptsilent.  Only could be heard the sharp, jarring grate of the steelrunners over the hard surface and the creak of the straining sled.As if through a wall, Daylight had passed from the hum and roar of theTivoli into another world--a world of silence and immobility.  Nothingstirred.  The Yukon slept under a coat of ice three feet thick.  Nobreath of wind blew.  Nor did the sap move in the hearts of the sprucetrees that forested the river banks on either hand.  The trees,burdened with the last infinitesimal pennyweight of snow their branchescould hold, stood in absolute petrifaction.  The slightest tremor wouldhave dislodged the snow, and no snow was dislodged.  The sled was theone point of life and motion in the midst of the solemn quietude, andthe harsh churn of its runners but emphasized the silence through whichit moved.It was a dead world, and furthermore, a gray world.  The weather wassharp and clear; there was no moisture in the atmosphere, no fog norhaze; yet the sky was a gray pall.  The reason for this was that,though there was no cloud in the sky to dim the brightness of day,there was no sun to give brightness.  Far to the south the sun climbedsteadily to meridian, but between it and the frozen Yukon intervenedthe bulge of the earth.  The Yukon lay in a night shadow, and the dayitself was in reality a long twilight-light.  At a quarter beforetwelve, where a wide bend of the river gave a long vista south, the sunshowed its upper rim above the sky-line.  But it did not riseperpendicularly.  Instead, it rose on a slant, so that by high noon ithad barely lifted its lower rim clear of the horizon.  It was a dim,wan sun.  There was no heat to its rays, and a man could gaze squarelyinto the full orb of it without hurt to his eyes.  No sooner had itreached meridian than it began its slant back beneath the horizon, andat quarter past twelve the earth threw its shadow again over the land.The men and dogs raced on.  Daylight and Kama were both savages so faras their stomachs were concerned.  They could eat irregularly in timeand quantity, gorging hugely on occasion, and on occasion going longstretches without eating at all.  As for the dogs, they ate but once aday, and then rarely did they receive more than a pound each of driedfish.  They were ravenously hungry and at the same time splendidly incondition. Like the wolves, their forebears, their nutritive processeswere rigidly economical and perfect.  There was no waste.  The lastleast particle of what they consumed was transformed into energy.And Kama and Daylight were like them.  Descended themselves from thegenerations that had endured, they, too, endured.  Theirs was thesimple, elemental economy.  A little food equipped them with prodigiousenergy.  Nothing was lost.  A man of soft civilization, sitting at adesk, would have grown lean and woe-begone on the fare that kept Kamaand Daylight at the top-notch of physical efficiency.  They knew, asthe man at the desk never knows, what it is to be normally hungry allthe time, so that they could eat any time.  Their appetites were alwayswith them and on edge, so that they bit voraciously into whateveroffered and with an entire innocence of indigestion.By three in the afternoon the long twilight faded into night. The starscame out, very near and sharp and bright, and by their light dogs andmen still kept the trail.  They were indefatigable.  And this was norecord run of a single day, but the first day of sixty such days.Though Daylight had passed a night without sleep, a night of dancingand carouse, it seemed to have left no effect.  For this there were twoexplanations first, his remarkable vitality; and next, the fact thatsuch nights were rare in his experience.  Again enters the man at thedesk, whose physical efficiency would be more hurt by a cup of coffeeat bedtime than could Daylight's by a whole night long of strong drinkand excitement.Daylight travelled without a watch, feeling the passage of time andlargely estimating it by subconscious processes.  By what he consideredmust be six o'clock, he began looking for a camping-place.  The trail,at a bend, plunged out across the river.  Not having found a likelyspot, they held on for the opposite bank a mile away.  But midway theyencountered an ice-jam which took an hour of heavy work to cross.  Atlast Daylight glimpsed what he was looking for, a dead tree close bythe bank.  The sled was run in and up.  Kama grunted with satisfaction,and the work of making camp was begun.The division of labor was excellent.  Each knew what he must do. Withone ax Daylight chopped down the dead pine.  Kama, with a snowshoe andthe other ax, cleared away the two feet of snow above the Yukon ice andchopped a supply of ice for cooking purposes.  A piece of dry birchbark started the fire, and Daylight went ahead with the cooking whilethe Indian unloaded the sled and fed the dogs their ration of driedfish.  The food sacks he slung high in the trees beyond leaping-reachof the huskies.  Next, he chopped down a young spruce tree and trimmedoff the boughs.  Close to the fire he trampled down the soft snow andcovered the packed space with the boughs.  On this flooring he tossedhis own and Daylight's gear-bags, containing dry socks and underwearand their sleeping-robes.  Kama, however, had two robes of rabbit skinto Daylight's one.They worked on steadily, without speaking, losing no time.  Each didwhatever was needed, without thought of leaving to the other the leasttask that presented itself to hand.  Thus, Kama saw when more ice wasneeded and went and got it, while a snowshoe, pushed over by the lungeof a dog, was stuck on end again by Daylight.  While coffee wasboiling, bacon frying, and flapjacks were being mixed, Daylight foundtime to put on a big pot of beans.  Kama came back, sat down on theedge of the spruce boughs, and in the interval of waiting, mendedharness."I t'ink dat Skookum and Booga make um plenty fight maybe," Kamaremarked, as they sat down to eat."Keep an eye on them," was Daylight's answer.And this was their sole conversation throughout the meal.  Once, with amuttered imprecation, Kama leaped away, a stick of firewood in hand,and clubbed apart a tangle of fighting dogs. Daylight, betweenmouthfuls, fed chunks of ice into the tin pot, where it thawed intowater.  The meal finished, Kama replenished the fire, cut more wood forthe morning, and returned to the spruce bough bed and hisharness-mending.  Daylight cut up generous chunks of bacon and droppedthem in the pot of bubbling beans.  The moccasins of both men were wet,and this in spite of the intense cold; so when there was no furtherneed for them to leave the oasis of spruce boughs, they took off theirmoccasins and hung them on short sticks to dry before the fire, turningthem about from time to time.  When the beans were finally cooked,Daylight ran part of them into a bag of flour-sacking a foot and a halflong and three inches in diameter.  This he then laid on the snow tofreeze.  The remainder of the beans were left in the pot for breakfast.It was past nine o'clock, and they were ready for bed.  The squabblingand bickering among the dogs had long since died down, and the wearyanimals were curled in the snow, each with his feet and nose bunchedtogether and covered by his wolf's brush of a tail.  Kama spread hissleeping-furs and lighted his pipe. Daylight rolled a brown-papercigarette, and the second conversation of the evening took place."I think we come near sixty miles," said Daylight."Um, I t'ink so," said Kama.They rolled into their robes, all-standing, each with a woolen Mackinawjacket on in place of the parkas[5] they had worn all day.  Swiftly,almost on the instant they closed their eyes, they were asleep.  Thestars leaped and danced in the frosty air, and overhead the coloredbars of the aurora borealis were shooting like great searchlights.In the darkness Daylight awoke and roused Kama.  Though the aurorastill flamed, another day had begun.  Warmed-over flapjacks,warmed-over beans, fried bacon, and coffee composed the breakfast.  Thedogs got nothing, though they watched with wistful mien from adistance, sitting up in the snow, their tails curled around their paws.Occasionally they lifted one fore paw or the other, with a restlessmovement, as if the frost tingled in their feet.  It was bitter cold,at least sixty-five below zero, and when Kama harnessed the dogs withnaked hands he was compelled several times to go over to the fire andwarm the numbing finger-tips.  Together the two men loaded and lashedthe sled.  They warmed their hands for the last time, pulled on theirmittens, and mushed the dogs over the bank and down to the river-trail.According to Daylight's estimate, it was around seven o'clock; but thestars danced just as brilliantly, and faint, luminous streaks ofgreenish aurora still pulsed overhead.Two hours later it became suddenly dark--so dark that they kept to thetrail largely by instinct; and Daylight knew that his time-estimate hadbeen right.  It was the darkness before dawn, never anywhere moreconspicuous than on the Alaskan winter-trail.Slowly the gray light came stealing through the gloom, imperceptibly atfirst, so that it was almost with surprise that they noticed the vagueloom of the trail underfoot.  Next, they were able to see thewheel-dog, and then the whole string of running dogs and snow-stretcheson either side.  Then the near bank loomed for a moment and was gone,loomed a second time and remained.  In a few minutes the far bank, amile away, unobtrusively came into view, and ahead and behind, thewhole frozen river could be seen, with off to the left a wide-extendingrange of sharp-cut, snow-covered mountains.  And that was all. No sunarose.  The gray light remained gray.Once, during the day, a lynx leaped lightly across the trail, under thevery nose of the lead-dog, and vanished in the white woods.  The dogs'wild impulses roused.  They raised the hunting-cry of the pack, surgedagainst their collars, and swerved aside in pursuit.  Daylight, yelling"Whoa!" struggled with the gee-pole and managed to overturn the sledinto the soft snow.  The dogs gave up, the sled was righted, and fiveminutes later they were flying along the hard-packed trail again.  Thelynx was the only sign of life they had seen in two days, and it,leaping velvet-footed and vanishing, had been more like an apparition.At twelve o'clock, when the sun peeped over the earth-bulge, theystopped and built a small fire on the ice.  Daylight, with the ax,chopped chunks off the frozen sausage of beans.  These, thawed andwarmed in the frying-pan, constituted their meal. They had no coffee.He did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury.  Thedogs stopped wrangling with one another, and looked on wistfully.  Onlyat night did they get their pound of fish.  In the meantime they worked.The cold snap continued.  Only men of iron kept the trail at such lowtemperatures, and Kama and Daylight were picked men of their races.But Kama knew the other was the better man, and thus, at the start, hewas himself foredoomed to defeat.  Not that he slackened his effort orwillingness by the slightest conscious degree, but that he was beatenby the burden he carried in his mind.  His attitude toward Daylight wasworshipful.  Stoical, taciturn, proud of his physical prowess, he foundall these qualities incarnated in his white companion.  Here was onethat excelled in the things worth excelling in, a man-god ready tohand, and Kama could not but worship--withal he gave no signs of it.No wonder the race of white men conquered, was his thought, when itbred men like this man.  What chance had the Indian against such adogged, enduring breed?  Even the Indians did not travel at such lowtemperatures, and theirs was the wisdom of thousands of generations;yet here was this Daylight, from the soft Southland, harder than they,laughing at their fears, and swinging along the trail ten and twelvehours a day.  And this Daylight thought that he could keep up a day'space of thirty-three miles for sixty days!  Wait till a fresh fall ofsnow came down, or they struck the unbroken trail or the rotten rim-icethat fringed open water.In the meantime Kama kept the pace, never grumbling, never shirking.Sixty-five degrees below zero is very cold.  Since water freezes atthirty-two above, sixty-five below meant ninety-seven degrees belowfreezing-point.  Some idea of the significance of this may be gained byconceiving of an equal difference of temperature in the oppositedirection.  One hundred and twenty-nine on the thermometer constitutesa very hot day, yet such a temperature is but ninety-seven degreesabove freezing.  Double this difference, and possibly some slightconception may be gained of the cold through which Kama and Daylighttravelled between dark and dark and through the dark.Kama froze the skin on his cheek-bones, despite frequent rubbings, andthe flesh turned black and sore.  Also he slightly froze the edges ofhis lung-tissues--a dangerous thing, and the basic reason why a manshould not unduly exert himself in the open at sixty-five below.  ButKama never complained, and Daylight was a furnace of heat, sleeping aswarmly under his six pounds of rabbit skins as the other did undertwelve pounds.On the second night, fifty more miles to the good, they camped in thevicinity of the boundary between Alaska and the Northwest Territory.The rest of the journey, save the last short stretch to Dyea, would betravelled on Canadian territory.  With the hard trail, and in theabsence of fresh snow, Daylight planned to make the camp of Forty Mileon the fourth night.  He told Kama as much, but on the third day thetemperature began to rise, and they knew snow was not far off; for onthe Yukon it must get warm in order to snow.  Also, on this day, theyencountered ten miles of chaotic ice-jams, where, a thousand times,they lifted the loaded sled over the huge cakes by the strength oftheir arms and lowered it down again.  Here the dogs were well-nighuseless, and both they and the men were tried excessively by theroughness of the way.  An hour's extra running that night caught uponly part of the lost time.In the morning they awoke to find ten inches of snow on their robes.The dogs were buried under it and were loath to leave their comfortablenests.  This new snow meant hard going.  The sled runners would notslide over it so well, while one of the men must go in advance of thedogs and pack it down with snowshoes so that they should not wallow.Quite different was it from the ordinary snow known to those of theSouthland.  It was hard, and fine, and dry.  It was more like sugar.Kick it, and it flew with a hissing noise like sand.  There was nocohesion among the particles, and it could not be moulded intosnowballs. It was not composed of flakes, but of crystals--tiny,geometrical frost-crystals.  In truth, it was not snow, but frost.The weather was warm, as well, barely twenty below zero, and the twomen, with raised ear-flaps and dangling mittens, sweated as theytoiled.  They failed to make Forty Mile that night, and when theypassed that camp next day Daylight paused only long enough to get themail and additional grub.  On the afternoon of the following day theycamped at the mouth of the Klondike River. Not a soul had theyencountered since Forty Mile, and they had made their own trail.  Asyet, that winter, no one had travelled the river south of Forty Mile,and, for that matter, the whole winter through they might be the onlyones to travel it.  In that day the Yukon was a lonely land.  Betweenthe Klondike River and Salt Water at Dyea intervened six hundred milesof snow-covered wilderness, and in all that distance there were but twoplaces where Daylight might look forward to meeting men.  Both wereisolated trading-posts, Sixty Mile and Fort Selkirk.  In thesummer-time Indians might be met with at the mouths of the Stewart andWhite rivers, at the Big and Little Salmons, and on Lake Le Barge; butin the winter, as he well knew, they would be on the trail of themoose-herds, following them back into the mountains.That night, camped at the mouth of the Klondike, Daylight did not turnin when the evening's work was done.  Had a white man been present,Daylight would have remarked that he felt his "hunch" working.  As itwas, he tied on his snowshoes, left the dogs curled in the snow andKama breathing heavily under his rabbit skins, and climbed up to thebig flat above the high earth-bank. But the spruce trees were too thickfor an outlook, and he threaded his way across the flat and up thefirst steep slopes of the mountain at the back.  Here, flowing in fromthe east at right angles, he could see the Klondike, and, bendinggrandly from the south, the Yukon.  To the left, and downstream, towardMoosehide Mountain, the huge splash of white, from which it took itsname, showing clearly in the starlight.  Lieutenant Schwatka had givenit its name, but he, Daylight, had first seen it long before thatintrepid explorer had crossed the Chilcoot and rafted down the Yukon.But the mountain received only passing notice.  Daylight's interest wascentered in the big flat itself, with deep water all along its edge forsteamboat landings."A sure enough likely town site," he muttered.  "Room for a camp offorty thousand men.  All that's needed is the gold-strike." Hemeditated for a space.  "Ten dollars to the pan'll do it, and it'd bethe all-firedest stampede Alaska ever seen.  And if it don't come here,it'll come somewhere hereabouts.  It's a sure good idea to keep an eyeout for town sites all the way up."He stood a while longer, gazing out over the lonely flat and visioningwith constructive imagination the scene if the stampede did come.  Infancy, he placed the sawmills, the big trading stores, the saloons, anddance-halls, and the long streets of miners' cabins.  And along thosestreets he saw thousands of men passing up and down, while before thestores were the heavy freighting-sleds, with long strings of dogsattached.  Also he saw the heavy freighters pulling down the mainstreet and heading up the frozen Klondike toward the imagined somewherewhere the diggings must be located.He laughed and shook the vision from his eyes, descended to the level,and crossed the flat to camp.  Five minutes after he had rolled up inhis robe, he opened his eyes and sat up, amazed that he was not alreadyasleep.  He glanced at the Indian sleeping beside him, at the embers ofthe dying fire, at the five dogs beyond, with their wolf's brushescurled over their noses, and at the four snowshoes standing upright inthe snow."It's sure hell the way that hunch works on me" he murmured. His mindreverted to the poker game.  "Four kings!" He grinned reminiscently."That WAS a hunch!"He lay down again, pulled the edge of the robe around his neck and overhis ear-flaps, closed his eyes, and this time fell asleep.[5] Parka: a light, hooded, smock-like garment made of cotton drill.CHAPTER VAt Sixty Mile they restocked provisions, added a few pounds of lettersto their load, and held steadily on.  From Forty Mile they had hadunbroken trail, and they could look forward only to unbroken trailclear to Dyea.  Daylight stood it magnificently, but the killing pacewas beginning to tell on Kama.  His pride kept his mouth shut, but theresult of the chilling of his lungs in the cold snap could not beconcealed.  Microscopically small had been the edges of the lung-tissuetouched by the frost, but they now began to slough off, giving rise toa dry, hacking cough.  Any unusually severe exertion precipitatedspells of coughing, during which he was almost like a man in a fit.The blood congested in his eyes till they bulged, while the tears randown his cheeks.  A whiff of the smoke from frying bacon would starthim off for a half-hour's paroxysm, and he kept carefully to windwardwhen Daylight was cooking.They plodded days upon days and without end over the soft, unpackedsnow.  It was hard, monotonous work, with none of the joy andblood-stir that went with flying over hard surface.  Now one man to thefore in the snowshoes, and now the other, it was a case of stubborn,unmitigated plod.  A yard of powdery snow had to be pressed down, andthe wide-webbed shoe, under a man's weight, sank a full dozen inchesinto the soft surface.  Snowshoe work, under such conditions, calledfor the use of muscles other than those used in ordinary walking.  Fromstep to step the rising foot could not come up and forward on a slant.It had to be raised perpendicularly.  When the snowshoe was pressedinto the snow, its nose was confronted by a vertical wall of snowtwelve inches high.  If the foot, in rising, slanted forward theslightest bit, the nose of the shoe penetrated the obstructing wall andtipped downward till the heel of the shoe struck the man's leg behind.Thus up, straight up, twelve inches, each foot must be raised everytime and all the time, ere the forward swing from the knee could begin.On this partially packed surface followed the dogs, the man at thegee-pole, and the sled.  At the best, toiling as only picked men couldtoil, they made no more than three miles an hour.  This meant longerhours of travel, and Daylight, for good measure and for a marginagainst accidents, hit the trail for twelve hours a day.  Since threehours were consumed by making camp at night and cooking beans, bygetting breakfast in the morning and breaking camp, and by thawingbeans at the midday halt, nine hours were left for sleep andrecuperation, and neither men nor dogs wasted many minutes of thosenine hours.At Selkirk, the trading post near Pelly River, Daylight suggested thatKama lay over, rejoining him on the back trip from Dyea.  A strayedIndian from Lake Le Barge was willing to take his place; but Kama wasobdurate.  He grunted with a slight intonation of resentment, and thatwas all.  The dogs, however, Daylight changed, leaving his ownexhausted team to rest up against his return, while he went on with sixfresh dogs.They travelled till ten o'clock the night they reached Selkirk, and atsix next morning they plunged ahead into the next stretch of wildernessof nearly five hundred miles that lay between Selkirk and Dyea.  Asecond cold snap came on, but cold or warm it was all the same, anunbroken trail.  When the thermometer went down to fifty below, it waseven harder to travel, for at that low temperature the hardfrost-crystals were more like sand-grains in the resistance theyoffered to the sled runners. The dogs had to pull harder than over thesame snow at twenty or thirty below zero.  Daylight increased the day'stravel to thirteen hours.  He jealously guarded the margin he hadgained, for he knew there were difficult stretches to come.It was not yet quite midwinter, and the turbulent Fifty Mile Rivervindicated his judgment.  In many places it ran wide open, withprecarious rim-ice fringing it on either side.  In numerous places,where the water dashed against the steep-sided bluffs, rim-ice wasunable to form.  They turned and twisted, now crossing the river, nowcoming back again, sometimes making half a dozen attempts before theyfound a way over a particularly bad stretch.  It was slow work.  Theice-bridges had to be tested, and either Daylight or Kama went inadvance, snowshoes on their feet, and long poles carried crosswise intheir hands.  Thus, if they broke through, they could cling to the polethat bridged the hole made by their bodies.  Several such accidentswere the share of each.  At fifty below zero, a man wet to the waistcannot travel without freezing; so each ducking meant delay.  As soonas rescued, the wet man ran up and down to keep up his circulation,while his dry companion built a fire.  Thus protected, a change ofgarments could be made and the wet ones dried against the nextmisadventure.To make matters worse, this dangerous river travel could not be done inthe dark, and their working day was reduced to the six hours oftwilight.  Every moment was precious, and they strove never to loseone.  Thus, before the first hint of the coming of gray day, camp wasbroken, sled loaded, dogs harnessed, and the two men crouched waitingover the fire.  Nor did they make the midday halt to eat.  As it was,they were running far behind their schedule, each day eating into themargin they had run up. There were days when they made fifteen miles,and days when they made a dozen.  And there was one bad stretch wherein two days they covered nine miles, being compelled to turn theirbacks three times on the river and to portage sled and outfit over themountains.At last they cleared the dread Fifty Mile River and came out on Lake LeBarge.  Here was no open water nor jammed ice.  For thirty miles ormore the snow lay level as a table; withal it lay three feet deep andwas soft as flour.  Three miles an hour was the best they could make,but Daylight celebrated the passing of the Fifty Mile by travelinglate.  At eleven in the morning they emerged at the foot of the lake.At three in the afternoon, as the Arctic night closed down, he caughthis first sight of the head of the lake, and with the first stars tookhis bearings.  At eight in the evening they left the lake behind andentered the mouth of the Lewes River.  Here a halt of half an hour wasmade, while chunks of frozen boiled beans were thawed and the dogs weregiven an extra ration of fish.  Then they pulled on up the river tillone in the morning, when they made their regular camp.They had hit the trail sixteen hours on end that day, the dogs had comein too tired to fight among themselves or even snarl, and Kama hadperceptibly limped the last several miles; yet Daylight was on trailnext morning at six o'clock.  By eleven he was at the foot of WhiteHorse, and that night saw him camped beyond the Box Canon, the last badriver-stretch behind him, the string of lakes before him.There was no let up in his pace.  Twelve hours a day, six in thetwilight, and six in the dark, they toiled on the trail.  Three hourswere consumed in cooking, repairing harnesses, and making and breakingcamp, and the remaining nine hours dogs and men slept as if dead.  Theiron strength of Kama broke.  Day by day the terrific toil sapped him.Day by day he consumed more of his reserves of strength.  He becameslower of movement, the resiliency went out of his muscles, and hislimp became permanent.  Yet he labored stoically on, never shirking,never grunting a hint of complaint.  Daylight was thin-faced and tired.He looked tired; yet somehow, with that marvelous mechanism of a bodythat was his, he drove on, ever on, remorselessly on.  Never was hemore a god in Kama's mind than in the last days of the south-boundtraverse, as the failing Indian watched him, ever to the fore, pressingonward with urgency of endurance such as Kama had never seen nordreamed could thrive in human form.The time came when Kama was unable to go in the lead and break trail,and it was a proof that he was far gone when he permitted Daylight totoil all day at the heavy snowshoe work.  Lake by lake they crossed thestring of lakes from Marsh to Linderman, and began the ascent ofChilcoot.  By all rights, Daylight should have camped below the lastpitch of the pass at the dim end of day; but he kept on and over anddown to Sheep Camp, while behind him raged a snow-storm that would havedelayed him twenty-four hours.This last excessive strain broke Kama completely.  In the morning hecould not travel.  At five, when called, he sat up after a struggle,groaned, and sank back again.  Daylight did the camp work of both,harnessed the dogs, and, when ready for the start, rolled the helplessIndian in all three sleeping robes and lashed him on top of the sled.The going was good; they were on the last lap; and he raced the dogsdown through Dyea Canon and along the hard-packed trail that led toDyea Post.  And running still, Kama groaning on top the load, andDaylight leaping at the gee-pole to avoid going under the runners ofthe flying sled, they arrived at Dyea by the sea.True to his promise, Daylight did not stop.  An hour's time saw thesled loaded with the ingoing mail and grub, fresh dogs harnessed, and afresh Indian engaged.  Kama never spoke from the time of his arrivaltill the moment Daylight, ready to depart, stood beside him to saygood-by.  They shook hands."You kill um dat damn Indian," Kama said.  "Sawee, Daylight?  You killum.""He'll sure last as far as Pelly," Daylight grinned.Kama shook his head doubtfully, and rolled over on his side, turninghis back in token of farewell.Daylight won across Chilcoot that same day, dropping down five hundredfeet in the darkness and the flurrying snow to Crater Lake, where hecamped.  It was a 'cold' camp, far above the timber-line, and he hadnot burdened his sled with firewood. That night three feet of snowcovered them, and in the black morning, when they dug themselves out,the Indian tried to desert.  He had had enough of traveling with whathe considered a madman.  But Daylight persuaded him in grim ways tostay by the outfit, and they pulled on across Deep Lake and Long Lakeand dropped down to the level-going of Lake Linderman.  It was the samekilling pace going in as coming out, and the Indian did not stand it aswell as Kama.  He, too, never complained.  Nor did he try again todesert.  He toiled on and did his best, while he renewed his resolve tosteer clear of Daylight in the future. The days slipped into days,nights and twilight's alternating, cold snaps gave way to snow-falls,and cold snaps came on again, and all the while, through the longhours, the miles piled up behind them.But on the Fifty Mile accident befell them.  Crossing an ice-bridge,the dogs broke through and were swept under the down-stream ice.  Thetraces that connected the team with the wheel-dog parted, and the teamwas never seen again.  Only the one wheel-dog remained, and Daylightharnessed the Indian and himself to the sled.  But a man cannot takethe place of a dog at such work, and the two men were attempting to dothe work of five dogs.  At the end of the first hour, Daylightlightened up. Dog-food, extra gear, and the spare ax were thrown away.Under the extraordinary exertion the dog snapped a tendon the followingday, and was hopelessly disabled.  Daylight shot it, and abandoned thesled.  On his back he took one hundred and sixty pounds of mail andgrub, and on the Indian's put one hundred and twenty-five pounds.  Thestripping of gear was remorseless.  The Indian was appalled when he sawevery pound of worthless mail matter retained, while beans, cups,pails, plates, and extra clothing were thrown by the board.  One robeeach was kept, one ax, one tin pail, and a scant supply of bacon andflour.  Bacon could be eaten raw on a pinch, and flour, stirred in hotwater, could keep men going.  Even the rifle and the score of rounds ofammunition were left behind.And in this fashion they covered the two hundred miles to Selkirk.Daylight travelled late and early, the hours formerly used bycamp-making and dog-tending being now devoted to the trail.  At nightthey crouched over a small fire, wrapped in their robes, drinking flourbroth and thawing bacon on the ends of sticks; and in the morningdarkness, without a word, they arose, slipped on their packs, adjustedhead-straps, and hit the trail.  The last miles into Selkirk, Daylightdrove the Indian before him, a hollow-cheeked, gaunt-eyed wraith of aman who else would have lain down and slept or abandoned his burden ofmail.At Selkirk, the old team of dogs, fresh and in condition, wereharnessed, and the same day saw Daylight plodding on, alternatingplaces at the gee-pole, as a matter of course, with the Le Barge Indianwho had volunteered on the way out.  Daylight was two days behind hisschedule, and falling snow and unpacked trail kept him two days behindall the way to Forty Mile.  And here the weather favored.  It was timefor a big cold snap, and he gambled on it, cutting down the weight ofgrub for dogs and men.  The men of Forty Mile shook their headsominously, and demanded to know what he would do if the snow still fell."That cold snap's sure got to come," he laughed, and mushed out on thetrail.A number of sleds had passed back and forth already that winter betweenForty Mile and Circle City, and the trail was well packed.  And thecold snap came and remained, and Circle City was only two hundred milesaway.  The Le Barge Indian was a young man, unlearned yet in his ownlimitations, and filled with pride.He took Daylight's pace with joy, and even dreamed, at first, that hewould play the white man out.  The first hundred miles he looked forsigns of weakening, and marveled that he saw them not.Throughout the second hundred miles he observed signs in himself, andgritted his teeth and kept up.  And ever Daylight flew on and on,running at the gee-pole or resting his spell on top the flying sled.The last day, clearer and colder than ever, gave perfect going, andthey covered seventy miles.  It was ten at night when they pulled upthe earth-bank and flew along the main street of Circle City; and theyoung Indian, though it was his spell to ride, leaped off and ranbehind the sled.  It was honorable braggadocio, and despite the factthat he had found his limitations and was pressing desperately againstthem, he ran gamely on.CHAPTER VIA crowd filled the Tivoli--the old crowd that had seen Daylight departtwo months before; for this was the night of the sixtieth day, andopinion was divided as ever as to whether or not he would compass theachievement.  At ten o'clock bets were still being made, though theodds rose, bet by bet, against his success.  Down in her heart theVirgin believed he had failed, yet she made a bet of twenty ounces withCharley Bates, against forty ounces, that Daylight would arrive beforemidnight.She it was who heard the first yelps of the dogs."Listen!" she cried.  "It's Daylight!"There was a general stampede for the door; but where the doublestorm-doors were thrown wide open, the crowd fell back.  They heard theeager whining of dogs, the snap of a dog-whip, and the voice ofDaylight crying encouragement as the weary animals capped all they haddone by dragging the sled in over the wooden floor.  They came in witha rush, and with them rushed in the frost, a visible vapor of smokingwhite, through which their heads and backs showed, as they strained inthe harness, till they had all the seeming of swimming in a river.Behind them, at the gee-pole, came Daylight, hidden to the knees by theswirling frost through which he appeared to wade.He was the same old Daylight, withal lean and tired-looking, and hisblack eyes were sparkling and flashing brighter than ever. His parka ofcotton drill hooded him like a monk, and fell in straight lines to hisknees.  Grimed and scorched by camp-smoke and fire, the garment initself told the story of his trip.  A two-months' beard covered hisface; and the beard, in turn, was matted with the ice of his breathingthrough the long seventy-mile run.His entry was spectacular, melodramatic; and he knew it.  It was hislife, and he was living it at the top of his bent.  Among his fellowshe was a great man, an Arctic hero.  He was proud of the fact, and itwas a high moment for him, fresh from two thousand miles of trail, tocome surging into that bar-room, dogs, sled, mail, Indian,paraphernalia, and all.  He had performed one more exploit that wouldmake the Yukon ring with his name--he, Burning Daylight, the king oftravelers and dog-mushers.He experienced a thrill of surprise as the roar of welcome went up andas every familiar detail of the Tivoli greeted his vision--the long barand the array of bottles, the gambling games, the big stove, theweigher at the gold-scales, the musicians, the men and women, theVirgin, Celia, and Nellie, Dan MacDonald, Bettles, Billy Rawlins, OlafHenderson, Doc Watson,--all of them.It was just as he had left it, and in all seeming it might well be thevery day he had left.  The sixty days of incessant travel through thewhite wilderness suddenly telescoped, and had no existence in time.They were a moment, an incident.  He had plunged out and into themthrough the wall of silence, and back through the wall of silence hehad plunged, apparently the next instant, and into the roar and turmoilof the Tivoli.A glance down at the sled with its canvas mail-bags was necessary toreassure him of the reality of those sixty days and the two thousandmiles over the ice.  As in a dream, he shook the hands that were thrustout to him.  He felt a vast exaltation.  Life was magnificent.  Heloved it all.  A great sense of humanness and comradeship swept overhim.  These were all his, his own kind.  It was immense, tremendous.He felt melting in the heart of him, and he would have liked to shakehands with them all at once, to gather them to his breast in one mightyembrace.He drew a deep breath and cried: "The winner pays, and I'm the winner,ain't I?  Surge up, you-all Malemutes and Siwashes, and name yourpoison!  There's your Dyea mail, straight from Salt Water, and nohornswogglin about it!  Cast the lashings adrift, you-all, and wadeinto it!"A dozen pairs of hands were at the sled-lashings, when the young LeBarge Indian, bending at the same task, suddenly and limplystraightened up.  In his eyes was a great surprise.  He stared abouthim wildly, for the thing he was undergoing was new to him.He was profoundly struck by an unguessed limitation.  He shook as witha palsy, and he gave at the knees, slowly sinking down to fall suddenlyacross the sled and to know the smashing blow of darkness across hisconsciousness."Exhaustion," said Daylight.  "Take him off and put him to bed, some ofyou-all.  He's sure a good Indian.""Daylight's right," was Doc Watson's verdict, a moment later. "Theman's plumb tuckered out."The mail was taken charge of, the dogs driven away to quarters and fed,and Bettles struck up the paean of the sassafras root as they lined upagainst the long bar to drink and talk and collect their debts.A few minutes later, Daylight was whirling around the dance-floor,waltzing with the Virgin.  He had replaced his parka with his fur capand blanket-cloth coat, kicked off his frozen moccasins, and wasdancing in his stocking feet.  After wetting himself to the knees latethat afternoon, he had run on without changing his foot-gear, and tothe knees his long German socks were matted with ice.  In the warmth ofthe room it began to thaw and to break apart in clinging chunks.  Thesechunks rattled together as his legs flew around, and every little whilethey fell clattering to the floor and were slipped upon by the otherdancers.  But everybody forgave Daylight.  He, who was one of the fewthat made the Law in that far land, who set the ethical pace, and byconduct gave the standard of right and wrong, was nevertheless abovethe Law.  He was one of those rare and favored mortals who can do nowrong.  What he did had to be right, whether others were permitted ornot to do the same things.  Of course, such mortals are so favored byvirtue of the fact that they almost always do the right and do it infiner and higher ways than other men.  So Daylight, an elder hero inthat young land and at the same time younger than most of them, movedas a creature apart, as a man above men, as a man who was greatly manand all man.  And small wonder it was that the Virgin yielded herselfto his arms, as they danced dance after dance, and was sick at heart atthe knowledge that he found nothing in her more than a good friend andan excellent dancer.  Small consolation it was to know that he hadnever loved any woman.  She was sick with love of him, and he dancedwith her as he would dance with any woman, as he would dance with a manwho was a good dancer and upon whose arm was tied a handkerchief toconventionalize him into a woman.One such man Daylight danced with that night.  Among frontiersmen ithas always been a test of endurance for one man to whirl another down;and when Ben Davis, the faro-dealer, a gaudy bandanna on his arm, gotDaylight in a Virginia reel, the fun began.  The reel broke up and allfell back to watch.  Around and around the two men whirled, always inthe one direction.  Word was passed on into the big bar-room, and barand gambling tables were deserted.  Everybody wanted to see, and theypacked and jammed the dance-room.  The musicians played on and on, andon and on the two men whirled.  Davis was skilled at the trick, and onthe Yukon he had put many a strong man on his back.  But after a fewminutes it was clear that he, and not Daylight, was going.For a while longer they spun around, and then Daylight suddenly stoodstill, released his partner, and stepped back, reeling himself, andfluttering his hands aimlessly, as if to support himself against theair.  But Davis, a giddy smile of consternation on his face, gavesideways, turned in an attempt to recover balance, and pitched headlongto the floor.  Still reeling and staggering and clutching at the airwith his hands, Daylight caught the nearest girl and started on in awaltz. Again he had done the big thing.  Weary from two thousand milesover the ice and a run that day of seventy miles, he had whirled afresh man down, and that man Ben Davis.Daylight loved the high places, and though few high places there werein his narrow experience, he had made a point of sitting in the highesthe had ever glimpsed.  The great world had never heard his name, but itwas known far and wide in the vast silent North, by whites and Indiansand Eskimos, from Bering Sea to the Passes, from the head reaches ofremotest rivers to the tundra shore of Point Barrow.  Desire formastery was strong in him, and it was all one whether wrestling withthe elements themselves, with men, or with luck in a gambling game.  Itwas all a game, life and its affairs.  And he was a gambler to thecore.  Risk and chance were meat and drink.  True, it was notaltogether blind, for he applied wit and skill and strength; but behindit all was the everlasting Luck, the thing that at times turned on itsvotaries and crushed the wise while it blessed the fools--Luck, thething all men sought and dreamed to conquer. And so he.  Deep in hislife-processes Life itself sang the siren song of its own majesty, evera-whisper and urgent, counseling him that he could achieve more thanother men, win out where they failed, ride to success where theyperished.  It was the urge of Life healthy and strong, unaware offrailty and decay, drunken with sublime complacence, ego-mad, enchantedby its own mighty optimism.And ever in vaguest whisperings and clearest trumpet-calls came themessage that sometime, somewhere, somehow, he would run Luck down, makehimself the master of Luck, and tie it and brand it as his own.  Whenhe played poker, the whisper was of four aces and royal flushes.  Whenhe prospected, it was of gold in the grass-roots, gold on bed-rock, andgold all the way down.  At the sharpest hazards of trail and river andfamine, the message was that other men might die, but that he wouldpull through triumphant.  It was the old, old lie of Life foolingitself, believing itself--immortal and indestructible, bound to achieveover other lives and win to its heart's desire.And so, reversing at times, Daylight waltzed off his dizziness and ledthe way to the bar.  But a united protest went up.  His theory that thewinner paid was no longer to be tolerated.  It was contrary to customand common sense, and while it emphasized good-fellowship,nevertheless, in the name of good-fellowship it must cease.  The drinkswere rightfully on Ben Davis, and Ben Davis must buy them.Furthermore, all drinks and general treats that Daylight was guilty ofought to be paid by the house, for Daylight brought much custom to itwhenever he made a night. Bettles was the spokesman, and his argument,tersely and offensively vernacular, was unanimously applauded.Daylight grinned, stepped aside to the roulette-table, and bought astack of yellow chips.  At the end of ten minutes he weighed in at thescales, and two thousand dollars in gold-dust was poured into his ownand an extra sack.  Luck, a mere flutter of luck, but it was his.Elation was added to elation.  He was living, and the night was his.He turned upon his well-wishing critics."Now the winner sure does pay," he said.And they surrendered.  There was no withstanding Daylight when hevaulted on the back of life, and rode it bitted and spurred.At one in the morning he saw Elijah Davis herding Henry Finn and JoeHines, the lumber-jack, toward the door.  Daylight interfered."Where are you-all going?" he demanded, attempting to draw them to thebar."Bed," Elijah Davis answered.He was a lean tobacco-chewing New Englander, the one daring spirit inhis family that had heard and answered the call of the West shoutingthrough the Mount Desert back odd-lots.  "Got to," Joe Hines addedapologetically.  "We're mushing out in the mornin'."Daylight still detained them.  "Where to?  What's the excitement?""No excitement," Elijah explained.  "We're just a-goin' to play yourhunch, an' tackle the Upper Country.  Don't you want to come along?""I sure do," Daylight affirmed.But the question had been put in fun, and Elijah ignored the acceptance."We're tacklin' the Stewart," he went on.  "Al Mayo told me he seensome likely lookin' bars first time he come down the Stewart, and we'regoin' to sample 'em while the river's froze. You listen, Daylight, an'mark my words, the time's comin' when winter diggin's'll be all the go.There'll be men in them days that'll laugh at our summer stratchin' an'ground-wallerin'."At that time, winter mining was undreamed of on the Yukon.  From themoss and grass the land was frozen to bed-rock, and frozen gravel, hardas granite, defied pick and shovel.  In the summer the men stripped theearth down as fast as the sun thawed it. Then was the time they didtheir mining.  During the winter they freighted their provisions, wentmoose-hunting, got all ready for the summer's work, and then loafed thebleak, dark months through in the big central camps such as Circle Cityand Forty Mile."Winter diggin's sure comin'," Daylight agreed.  "Wait till that bigstrike is made up river.  Then you-all'll see a new kind of mining.What's to prevent wood-burning and sinking shafts and drifting alongbed-rock?  Won't need to timber.  That frozen muck and gravel'll standtill hell is froze and its mill-tails is turned to ice-cream.  Why,they'll be working pay-streaks a hundred feet deep in them days that'scomin'.  I'm sure going along with you-all, Elijah."Elijah laughed, gathered his two partners up, and was making a secondattempt to reach the door."Hold on," Daylight called.  "I sure mean it."The three men turned back suddenly upon him, in their faces surprise,delight, and incredulity."G'wan, you're foolin'," said Finn, the other lumberjack, a quiet,steady, Wisconsin man."There's my dawgs and sled," Daylight answered.  "That'll make twoteams and halve the loads--though we-all'll have to travel easy for aspell, for them dawgs is sure tired."The three men were overjoyed, but still a trifle incredulous."Now look here," Joe Hines blurted out, "none of your foolin, Daylight.We mean business.  Will you come?"Daylight extended his hand and shook."Then you'd best be gettin' to bed," Elijah advised. "We're mushin' outat six, and four hours' sleep is none so long.""Mebbe we ought to lay over a day and let him rest up," Finn suggested.Daylight's pride was touched."No you don't," he cried.  "We all start at six.  What time do you-allwant to be called?  Five?  All right, I'll rouse you-all out.""You oughter have some sleep," Elijah counselled gravely.  "You can'tgo on forever."Daylight was tired, profoundly tired.  Even his iron body acknowledgedweariness.  Every muscle was clamoring for bed and rest, was appalledat continuance of exertion and at thought of the trail again.  All thisphysical protest welled up into his brain in a wave of revolt.  Butdeeper down, scornful and defiant, was Life itself, the essential fireof it, whispering that all Daylight's fellows were looking on, that nowwas the time to pile deed upon deed, to flaunt his strength in the faceof strength.  It was merely Life, whispering its ancient lies. And inleague with it was whiskey, with all its consummate effrontery andvain-glory."Mebbe you-all think I ain't weaned yet?" Daylight demanded. "Why, Iain't had a drink, or a dance, or seen a soul in two months.  You-allget to bed.  I'll call you-all at five."And for the rest of the night he danced on in his stocking feet, and atfive in the morning, rapping thunderously on the door of his newpartners' cabin, he could be heard singing the song that had given himhis name:--"Burning daylight, you-all Stewart River hunchers!  Burning daylight!Burning daylight!  Burning daylight!"CHAPTER VIIThis time the trail was easier.  It was better packed, and they werenot carrying mail against time.  The day's run was shorter, andlikewise the hours on trail.  On his mail run Daylight had played outthree Indians; but his present partners knew that they must not beplayed out when they arrived at the Stewart bars, so they set theslower pace.  And under this milder toil, where his companionsnevertheless grew weary, Daylight recuperated and rested up.  At FortyMile they laid over two days for the sake of the dogs, and at SixtyMile Daylight's team was left with the trader.  Unlike Daylight, afterthe terrible run from Selkirk to Circle City, they had been unable torecuperate on the back trail.  So the four men pulled on from SixtyMile with a fresh team of dogs on Daylight's sled.The following night they camped in the cluster of islands at the mouthof the Stewart.  Daylight talked town sites, and, though the otherslaughed at him, he staked the whole maze of high, wooded islands."Just supposing the big strike does come on the Stewart," he argued."Mebbe you-all'll be in on it, and then again mebbe you-all won't.  ButI sure will.  You-all'd better reconsider and go in with me on it."But they were stubborn."You're as bad as Harper and Joe Ladue," said Joe Hines. "They'realways at that game.  You know that big flat jest below the Klondikeand under Moosehide Mountain?  Well, the recorder at Forty Mile wastellin' me they staked that not a month ago--The Harper & Ladue TownSite.  Ha! Ha! Ha!"Elijah and Finn joined him in his laughter; but Daylight was gravely inearnest."There she is!" he cried.  "The hunch is working!  It's in the air, Itell you-all!  What'd they-all stake the big flat for if they-alldidn't get the hunch?  Wish I'd staked it."The regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter."Laugh, you-all, laugh!  That's what's the trouble with you-all.You-all think gold-hunting is the only way to make a stake.  But let metell you-all that when the big strike sure does come, you-all'll do alittle surface-scratchin' and muck-raking, but danged little you-all'llhave to show for it.  You-all laugh at quicksilver in the riffles andthink flour gold was manufactured by God Almighty for the expresspurpose of fooling suckers and chechaquos.  Nothing but coarse gold foryou-all, that's your way, not getting half of it out of the ground andlosing into the tailings half of what you-all do get."But the men that land big will be them that stake the town sites,organize the tradin' companies, start the banks--"Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.  Banks in Alaska! The ideaof it was excruciating."Yep, and start the stock exchanges--"Again they were convulsed.  Joe Hines rolled over on his sleeping-robe,holding his sides."And after them will come the big mining sharks that buy whole creekswhere you-all have been scratching like a lot of picayune hens, andthey-all will go to hydraulicking in summer and steam-thawing inwinter--"Steam-thawing!  That was the limit.  Daylight was certainly exceedinghimself in his consummate fun-making. Steam-thawing--when evenwood-burning was an untried experiment, a dream in the air!"Laugh, dang you, laugh! Why your eyes ain't open yet.  You-all are abunch of little mewing kittens.  I tell you-all if that strike comes onKlondike, Harper and Ladue will be millionaires. And if it comes onStewart, you-all watch the Elam Harnish town site boom.  In them days,when you-all come around makin' poor mouths..."  He heaved a sigh ofresignation.  "Well, I suppose I'll have to give you-all a grub-stakeor soup, or something or other."Daylight had vision.  His scope had been rigidly limited, yet whateverhe saw, he saw big.  His mind was orderly, his imagination practical,and he never dreamed idly.  When he superimposed a feverish metropolison a waste of timbered, snow-covered flat, he predicated first thegold-strike that made the city possible, and next he had an eye forsteamboat landings, sawmill and warehouse locations, and all the needsof a far-northern mining city.  But this, in turn, was the mere settingfor something bigger, namely, the play of temperament. Opportunitiesswarmed in the streets and buildings and human and economic relationsof the city of his dream.  It was a larger table for gambling.  Thelimit was the sky, with the Southland on one side and the auroraborealis on the other.  The play would be big, bigger than any Yukonerhad ever imagined, and he, Burning Daylight, would see that he got inon that play.In the meantime there was naught to show for it but the hunch. But itwas coming.  As he would stake his last ounce on a good poker hand, sohe staked his life and effort on the hunch that the future held instore a big strike on the Upper River.  So he and his three companions,with dogs, and sleds, and snowshoes, toiled up the frozen breast of theStewart, toiled on and on through the white wilderness where theunending stillness was never broken by the voices of men, the stroke ofan ax, or the distant crack of a rifle.  They alone moved through thevast and frozen quiet, little mites of earth-men, crawling their scoreof miles a day, melting the ice that they might have water to drink,camping in the snow at night, their wolf-dogs curled in frost-rimed,hairy bunches, their eight snowshoes stuck on end in the snow besidethe sleds.No signs of other men did they see, though once they passed a rudepoling-boat, cached on a platform by the river bank. Whoever had cachedit had never come back for it; and they wondered and mushed on.Another time they chanced upon the site of an Indian village, but theIndians had disappeared; undoubtedly they were on the higher reaches ofthe Stewart in pursuit of the moose-herds.  Two hundred miles up fromthe Yukon, they came upon what Elijah decided were the bars mentionedby Al Mayo.  A permanent camp was made, their outfit of food cached ona high platform to keep it from the dogs, and they started work on thebars, cutting their way down to gravel through the rim of ice.It was a hard and simple life.  Breakfast over, and they were at workby the first gray light; and when night descended, they did theircooking and camp-chores, smoked and yarned for a while, then rolled upin their sleeping-robes, and slept while the aurora borealis flamedoverhead and the stars leaped and danced in the great cold.  Their farewas monotonous: sour-dough bread, bacon, beans, and an occasional dishof rice cooked along with a handful of prunes.  Fresh meat they failedto obtain.  There was an unwonted absence of animal life.  At rareintervals they chanced upon the trail of a snowshoe rabbit or anermine; but in the main it seemed that all life had fled the land.  Itwas a condition not unknown to them, for in all their experience, atone time or another, they had travelled one year through a regionteeming with game, where, a year or two or three years later, no gameat all would be found.Gold they found on the bars, but not in paying quantities. Elijah,while on a hunt for moose fifty miles away, had panned the surfacegravel of a large creek and found good colors.  They harnessed theirdogs, and with light outfits sledded to the place.  Here, and possiblyfor the first time in the history of the Yukon, wood-burning, insinking a shaft, was tried.  It was Daylight's initiative.  Afterclearing away the moss and grass, a fire of dry spruce was built.  Sixhours of burning thawed eight inches of muck.  Their picks drove fulldepth into it, and, when they had shoveled out, another fire wasstarted.  They worked early and late, excited over the success of theexperiment.  Six feet of frozen muck brought them to gravel, likewisefrozen. Here progress was slower.  But they learned to handle theirfires better, and were soon able to thaw five and six inches at aburning.  Flour gold was in this gravel, and after two feet it gaveaway again to muck.  At seventeen feet they struck a thin streak ofgravel, and in it coarse gold, testpans running as high as six andeight dollars.  Unfortunately, this streak of gravel was not more thanan inch thick.  Beneath it was more muck, tangled with the trunks ofancient trees and containing fossil bones of forgotten monsters.  Butgold they had found--coarse gold; and what more likely than that thebig deposit would be found on bed-rock?  Down to bed-rock they wouldgo, if it were forty feet away.  They divided into two shifts, workingday and night, on two shafts, and the smoke of their burning rosecontinually.It was at this time that they ran short of beans and that Elijah wasdespatched to the main camp to bring up more grub.  Elijah was one ofthe hard-bitten old-time travelers himself.  The round trip was ahundred miles, but he promised to be back on the third day, one daygoing light, two days returning heavy.  Instead, he arrived on thenight of the second day.  They had just gone to bed when they heard himcoming."What in hell's the matter now?" Henry Finn demanded, as the empty sledcame into the circle of firelight and as he noted that Elijah's long,serious face was longer and even more serious.Joe Hines threw wood on the fire, and the three men, wrapped in theirrobes, huddled up close to the warmth.  Elijah's whiskered face wasmatted with ice, as were his eyebrows, so that, what of his fur garb,he looked like a New England caricature of Father Christmas."You recollect that big spruce that held up the corner of the cachenext to the river?" Elijah began.The disaster was quickly told.  The big tree, with all the seeming ofhardihood, promising to stand for centuries to come, had suffered froma hidden decay.  In some way its rooted grip on the earth had weakened.The added burden of the cache and the winter snow had been too much forit; the balance it had so long maintained with the forces of itsenvironment had been overthrown; it had toppled and crashed to theground, wrecking the cache and, in turn, overthrowing the balance withenvironment that the four men and eleven dogs had been maintaining.Their supply of grub was gone.  The wolverines had got into the wreckedcache, and what they had not eaten they had destroyed."They plumb e't all the bacon and prunes and sugar and dog-food,"Elijah reported, "and gosh darn my buttons, if they didn't gnaw openthe sacks and scatter the flour and beans and rice from Dan toBeersheba.  I found empty sacks where they'd dragged them a quarter ofa mile away."Nobody spoke for a long minute.  It was nothing less than acatastrophe, in the dead of an Arctic winter and in a game-abandonedland, to lose their grub.  They were not panic-stricken, but they werebusy looking the situation squarely in the face and considering.  JoeHines was the first to speak."We can pan the snow for the beans and rice... though there wa'n'tmore'n eight or ten pounds of rice left.""And somebody will have to take a team and pull for Sixty Mile,"Daylight said next."I'll go," said Finn.They considered a while longer."But how are we going to feed the other team and three men till he getsback?" Hines demanded."Only one thing to it," was Elijah's contribution.  "You'll have totake the other team, Joe, and pull up the Stewart till you find themIndians.  Then you come back with a load of meat. You'll get here longbefore Henry can make it from Sixty Mile, and while you're gonethere'll only be Daylight and me to feed, and we'll feed good andsmall.""And in the morning we-all'll pull for the cache and pan snow to findwhat grub we've got."  Daylight lay back, as he spoke, and rolled inhis robe to sleep, then added: "Better turn in for an early start.  Twoof you can take the dogs down.  Elijah and me'll skin out on both sidesand see if we-all can scare up a moose on the way down."CHAPTER VIIINo time was lost.  Hines and Finn, with the dogs, already on shortrations, were two days in pulling down.  At noon of the third dayElijah arrived, reporting no moose sign.  That night Daylight came inwith a similar report.  As fast as they arrived, the men had startedcareful panning of the snow all around the cache.  It was a large task,for they found stray beans fully a hundred yards from the cache.  Onemore day all the men toiled. The result was pitiful, and the fourshowed their caliber in the division of the few pounds of food that hadbeen recovered. Little as it was, the lion's share was left withDaylight and Elijah.  The men who pulled on with the dogs, one up theStewart and one down, would come more quickly to grub.  The two whoremained would have to last out till the others returned. Furthermore,while the dogs, on several ounces each of beans a day, would travelslowly, nevertheless, the men who travelled with them, on a pinch,would have the dogs themselves to eat. But the men who remained, whenthe pinch came, would have no dogs.  It was for this reason thatDaylight and Elijah took the more desperate chance.  They could not doless, nor did they care to do less.  The days passed, and the winterbegan merging imperceptibly into the Northland spring that comes like athunderbolt of suddenness.  It was the spring of 1896 that waspreparing.  Each day the sun rose farther east of south, remainedlonger in the sky, and set farther to the west.  March ended and Aprilbegan, and Daylight and Elijah, lean and hungry, wondered what hadbecome of their two comrades.  Granting every delay, and throwing ingenerous margins for good measure, the time was long since passed whenthey should have returned.  Without doubt they had met with disaster.The party had considered the possibility of disaster for one man, andthat had been the principal reason for despatching the two in differentdirections.  But that disaster should have come to both of them was thefinal blow.In the meantime, hoping against hope, Daylight and Elija eked out ameagre existence.  The thaw had not yet begun, so they were able togather the snow about the ruined cache and melt it in pots and pailsand gold pans.  Allowed to stand for a while, when poured off, a thindeposit of slime was found on the bottoms of the vessels.  This was theflour, the infinitesimal trace of it scattered through thousands ofcubic yards of snow.  Also, in this slime occurred at intervals awater-soaked tea-leaf or coffee-ground, and there were in it fragmentsof earth and litter.  But the farther they worked away from the site ofthe cache, the thinner became the trace of flour, the smaller thedeposit of slime.Elijah was the older man, and he weakened first, so that he came to lieup most of the time in his furs.  An occasional tree-squirrel kept themalive.  The hunting fell upon Daylight, and it was hard work.  With butthirty rounds of ammunition, he dared not risk a miss; and, since hisrifle was a 45-90, he was compelled to shoot the small creaturesthrough the head.  There were very few of them, and days went bywithout seeing one.  When he did see one, he took infinite precautions.He would stalk it for hours.  A score of times, with arms that shookfrom weakness, he would draw a sight on the animal and refrain frompulling the trigger.  His inhibition was a thing of iron.  He was themaster. Not til absolute certitude was his did he shoot.  No matter howsharp the pangs of hunger and desire for that palpitating morsel ofchattering life, he refused to take the slightest risk of a miss.  He,born gambler, was gambling in the bigger way.  His life was the stake,his cards were the cartridges, and he played as only a big gamblercould play, with infinite precaution, with infinite consideration.Each shot meant a squirrel, and though days elapsed between shots, itnever changed his method of play.Of the squirrels, nothing was lost.  Even the skins were boiled to makebroth, the bones pounded into fragments that could be chewed andswallowed.  Daylight prospected through the snow, and found occasionalpatches of mossberries.  At the best, mossberries were composedpractically of seeds and water, with a tough rind of skin about them;but the berries he found were of the preceding year, dry andshrivelled, and the nourishment they contained verged on the minusquality.  Scarcely better was the bark of young saplings, stewed for anhour and swallowed after prodigious chewing.April drew toward its close, and spring smote the land.  The daysstretched out their length.  Under the heat of the sun, the snow beganto melt, while from down under the snow arose the trickling of tinystreams.  For twenty-four hours the Chinook wind blew, and in thattwenty-four hours the snow was diminished fully a foot in depth.  Inthe late afternoons the melting snow froze again, so that its surfacebecame ice capable of supporting a man's weight.  Tiny white snow-birdsappeared from the south, lingered a day, and resumed their journey intothe north.  Once, high in the air, looking for open water and ahead ofthe season, a wedged squadron of wild geese honked northwards.  Anddown by the river bank a clump of dwarf willows burst into bud.  Theseyoung buds, stewed, seemed to posess an encouraging nutrition. Elijahtook heart of hope, though he was cast down again when Daylight failedto find another clump of willows.The sap was rising in the trees, and daily the trickle of unseenstreamlets became louder as the frozen land came back to life. But theriver held in its bonds of frost.  Winter had been long months inriveting them, and not in a day were they to be broken, not even by thethunderbolt of spring.  May came, and stray last-year's mosquitoes,full-grown but harmless, crawled out of rock crevices and rotten logs.Crickets began to chirp, and more geese and ducks flew overhead.  Andstill the river held.  By May tenth, the ice of the Stewart, with agreat rending and snapping, tore loose from the banks and rose threefeet.  But it did not go down-stream.  The lower Yukon, up to where theStewart flowed into it, must first break and move on.  Until then theice of the Stewart could only rise higher and higher on the increasingflood beneath.  When the Yukon would break was problematical.  Twothousand miles away it flowed into Bering Sea, and it was the iceconditions of Bering Sea that would determine when the Yukon could riditself of the millions of tons of ice that cluttered its breast.On the twelfth of May, carrying their sleeping-robes, a pail, an ax,and the precious rifle, the two men started down the river on the ice.Their plan was to gain to the cached poling-boat they had seen, so thatat the first open water they could launch it and drift with the streamto Sixty Mile.  In their weak condition, without food, the going wasslow and difficult. Elijah developed a habit of falling down and beingunable to rise.  Daylight gave of his own strength to lift him to hisfeet, whereupon the older man would stagger automatically on until hestumbled and fell again.On the day they should have reached the boat, Elijah collapsed utterly.When Daylight raised him, he fell again.  Daylight essayed to walk withhim, supporting him, but such was Daylight's own weakness that theyfell together.Dragging Elijah to the bank, a rude camp was made, and Daylight startedout in search of squirrels.  It was at this time that he likewisedeveloped the falling habit.  In the evening he found his firstsquirrel, but darkness came on without his getting a certain shot.With primitive patience he waited till next day, and then, within thehour, the squirrel was his.The major portion he fed to Elijah, reserving for himself the tougherparts and the bones.  But such is the chemistry of life, that thissmall creature, this trifle of meat that moved, by being eaten,transmuted to the meat of the men the same power to move.  No longerdid the squirrel run up spruce trees, leap from branch to branch, orcling chattering to giddy perches.  Instead, the same energy that haddone these things flowed into the wasted muscles and reeling wills ofthe men, making them move--nay, moving them--till they tottered theseveral intervening miles to the cached boat, underneath which theyfell together and lay motionless a long time.Light as the task would have been for a strong man to lower the smallboat to the ground, it took Daylight hours.  And many hours more, dayby day, he dragged himself around it, lying on his side to calk thegaping seams with moss.  Yet, when this was done, the river still held.Its ice had risen many feet, but would not start down-stream.  And onemore task waited, the launching of the boat when the river ran water toreceive it.  Vainly Daylight staggered and stumbled and fell and creptthrough the snow that was wet with thaw, or across it when the night'sfrost still crusted it beyond the weight of a man, searching for onemore squirrel, striving to achieve one more transmutation of furry leapand scolding chatter into the lifts and tugs of a man's body that wouldhoist the boat over the rim of shore-ice and slide it down into thestream.Not till the twentieth of May did the river break.  The down-streammovement began at five in the morning, and already were the days solong that Daylight sat up and watched the ice-run.  Elijah was too fargone to be interested in the spectacle.  Though vaguely conscious, helay without movement while the ice tore by, great cakes of it caromingagainst the bank, uprooting trees, and gouging out earth by hundreds oftons.All about them the land shook and reeled from the shock of thesetremendous collisions.  At the end of an hour the run stopped.Somewhere below it was blocked by a jam.  Then the river began to rise,lifting the ice on its breast till it was higher than the bank.  Frombehind ever more water bore down, and ever more millions of tons of iceadded their weight to the congestion. The pressures and stresses becameterrific.  Huge cakes of ice were squeezed out till they popped intothe air like melon seeds squeezed from between the thumb and forefingerof a child, while all along the banks a wall of ice was forced up.When the jam broke, the noise of grinding and smashing redoubled.  Foranother hour the run continued.  The river fell rapidly.  But the wallof ice on top the bank, and extending down into the falling water,remained.The tail of the ice-run passed, and for the first time in six monthsDaylight saw open water.  He knew that the ice had not yet passed outfrom the upper reaches of the Stewart, that it lay in packs and jams inthose upper reaches, and that it might break loose and come down in asecond run any time; but the need was too desperate for him to linger.Elijah was so far gone that he might pass at any moment.  As forhimself, he was not sure that enough strength remained in his wastedmuscles to launch the boat.  It was all a gamble.  If he waited for thesecond ice-run, Elijah would surely die, and most probably himself.  Ifhe succeeded in launching the boat, if he kept ahead of the secondice-run, if he did not get caught by some of the runs from the upperYukon; if luck favored in all these essential particulars, as well asin a score of minor ones, they would reach Sixty Mile and be saved,if--and again the if--he had strength enough to land the boat at SixtyMile and not go by.He set to work.  The wall of ice was five feet above the ground onwhich the boat rested.  First prospecting for the best launching-place,he found where a huge cake of ice shelved upward from the river thatran fifteen feet below to the top of the wall.  This was a score offeet away, and at the end of an hour he had managed to get the boatthat far.  He was sick with nausea from his exertions, and at times itseemed that blindness smote him, for he could not see, his eyes vexedwith spots and points of light that were as excruciating asdiamond-dust, his heart pounding up in his throat and suffocating him.Elijah betrayed no interest, did not move nor open his eyes; andDaylight fought out his battle alone.  At last, falling on his kneesfrom the shock of exertion, he got the boat poised on a secure balanceon top the wall.  Crawling on hands and knees, he placed in the boathis rabbit-skin robe, the rifle, and the pail.  He did not bother withthe ax.  It meant an additional crawl of twenty feet and back, and ifthe need for it should arise he well knew he would be past all need.Elijah proved a bigger task than he had anticipated.  A few inches at atime, resting in between, he dragged him over the ground and up abroken rubble of ice to the side of the boat. But into the boat hecould not get him.  Elijah's limp body was far more difficult to liftand handle than an equal weight of like dimensions but rigid.  Daylightfailed to hoist him, for the body collapsed at the middle like apart-empty sack of corn. Getting into the boat, Daylight tried vainlyto drag his comrade in after him.  The best he could do was to getElijah's head and shoulders on top the gunwale.  When he released hishold, to heave from farther down the body, Elijah promptly gave at themiddle and came down on the ice.In despair, Daylight changed his tactics.  He struck the other in theface."God Almighty, ain't you-all a man?" he cried.  "There! damn you-all!there!"At each curse he struck him on the cheeks, the nose, the mouth,striving, by the shock of the hurt, to bring back the sinking soul andfar-wandering will of the man.  The eyes fluttered open."Now listen!" he shouted hoarsely.  "When I get your head to thegunwale, hang on!  Hear me?  Hang on!  Bite into it with your teeth,but HANG ON!"The eyes fluttered down, but Daylight knew the message had beenreceived.  Again he got the helpless man's head and shoulders on thegunwale."Hang on, damn you!  Bite in!" he shouted, as he shifted his grip lowerdown.One weak hand slipped off the gunwale, the fingers of the other handrelaxed, but Elijah obeyed, and his teeth held on.  When the lift came,his face ground forward, and the splintery wood tore and crushed theskin from nose, lips, and chin; and, face downward, he slipped on anddown to the bottom of the boat till his limp middle collapsed acrossthe gunwale and his legs hung down outside.  But they were only hislegs, and Daylight shoved them in; after him.  Breathing heavily, heturned Elijah over on his back, and covered him with his robes.The final task remained--the launching of the boat.  This, ofnecessity, was the severest of all, for he had been compelled to loadhis comrade in aft of the balance.  It meant a supreme effort atlifting.  Daylight steeled himself and began. Something must havesnapped, for, though he was unaware of it, the next he knew he waslying doubled on his stomach across the sharp stern of the boat.Evidently, and for the first time in his life, he had fainted.Furthermore, it seemed to him that he was finished, that he had not onemore movement left in him, and that, strangest of all, he did not care.Visions came to him, clear-cut and real, and concepts sharp as steelcutting-edges. He, who all his days had looked on naked Life, had neverseen so much of Life's nakedness before.  For the first time heexperienced a doubt of his own glorious personality.  For the momentLife faltered and forgot to lie.  After all, he was a littleearth-maggot, just like all the other earth-maggots, like the squirrelhe had eaten, like the other men he had seen fail and die, like JoeHines and Henry Finn, who had already failed and were surely dead, likeElijah lying there uncaring, with his skinned face, in the bottom ofthe boat.  Daylight's position was such that from where he lay he couldlook up river to the bend, around which, sooner or later, the nextice-run would come.  And as he looked he seemed to see back through thepast to a time when neither white man nor Indian was in the land, andever he saw the same Stewart River, winter upon winter, breasted withice, and spring upon spring bursting that ice asunder and running free.And he saw also into an illimitable future, when the last generationsof men were gone from off the face of Alaska, when he, too, would begone, and he saw, ever remaining, that river, freezing and fresheting,and running on and on.Life was a liar and a cheat.  It fooled all creatures.  It had fooledhim, Burning Daylight, one of its chiefest and most joyous exponents.He was nothing--a mere bunch of flesh and nerves and sensitiveness thatcrawled in the muck for gold, that dreamed and aspired and gambled, andthat passed and was gone.  Only the dead things remained, the thingsthat were not flesh and nerves and sensitiveness, the sand and muck andgravel, the stretching flats, the mountains, the river itself, freezingand breaking, year by year, down all the years.  When all was said anddone, it was a scurvy game.  The dice were loaded.  Those that died didnot win, and all died.  Who won?  Not even Life, the stool-pigeon, thearch-capper for the game--Life, the ever flourishing graveyard, theeverlasting funeral procession.He drifted back to the immediate present for a moment and noted thatthe river still ran wide open, and that a moose-bird, perched on thebow of the boat, was surveying him impudently. Then he drifted dreamilyback to his meditations.There was no escaping the end of the game.  He was doomed surely to beout of it all.  And what of it?  He pondered that question again andagain.Conventional religion had passed Daylight by.  He had lived a sort ofreligion in his square dealing and right playing with other men, and hehad not indulged in vain metaphysics about future life.  Death endedall.  He had always believed that, and been unafraid.  And at thismoment, the boat fifteen feet above the water and immovable, himselffainting with weakness and without a particle of strength left in him,he still believed that death ended all, and he was still unafraid.  Hisviews were too simply and solidly based to be overthrown by the firstsquirm, or the last, of death-fearing life.He had seen men and animals die, and into the field of his vision, byscores, came such deaths.  He saw them over again, just as he had seenthem at the time, and they did not shake him.What of it?  They were dead, and dead long since.  They weren'tbothering about it.  They weren't lying on their bellies across a boatand waiting to die.  Death was easy--easier than he had ever imagined;and, now that it was near, the thought of it made him glad.A new vision came to him.  He saw the feverish city of his dream--thegold metropolis of the North, perched above the Yukon on a highearth-bank and far-spreading across the flat.  He saw the riversteamers tied to the bank and lined against it three deep; he saw thesawmills working and the long dog-teams, with double sleds behind,freighting supplies to the diggings.  And he saw, further, thegambling-houses, banks, stock-exchanges, and all the gear and chips andmarkers, the chances and opportunities, of a vastly bigger gamblinggame than any he had ever seen.  It was sure hell, he thought, with thehunch a-working and that big strike coming, to be out of it all.  Lifethrilled and stirred at the thought and once more began uttering hisancient lies.Daylight rolled over and off the boat, leaning against it as he sat onthe ice.  He wanted to be in on that strike.  And why shouldn't he?Somewhere in all those wasted muscles of his was enough strength, if hecould gather it all at once, to up-end the boat and launch it.  Quiteirrelevantly the idea suggested itself of buying a share in theKlondike town site from Harper and Joe Ladue.  They would surely sell athird interest cheap.  Then, if the strike came on the Stewart, hewould be well in on it with the Elam Harnish town site; if on theKlondike, he would not be quite out of it.In the meantime, he would gather strength.  He stretched out on the icefull length, face downward, and for half an hour he lay and rested.Then he arose, shook the flashing blindness from his eyes, and tookhold of the boat.  He knew his condition accurately.  If the firsteffort failed, the following efforts were doomed to fail.  He must pullall his rallied strength into the one effort, and so thoroughly must heput all of it in that there would be none left for other attempts.He lifted, and he lifted with the soul of him as well as with the body,consuming himself, body and spirit, in the effort.  The boat rose.  Hethought he was going to faint, but he continued to lift.  He felt theboat give, as it started on its downward slide.  With the last shred ofhis strength he precipitated himself into it, landing in a sick heap onElijah's legs.  He was beyond attempting to rise, and as he lay heheard and felt the boat take the water.  By watching the tree-tops heknew it was whirling.  A smashing shock and flying fragments of icetold him that it had struck the bank.  A dozen times it whirled andstruck, and then it floated easily and free.Daylight came to, and decided he had been asleep.  The sun denoted thatseveral hours had passed.  It was early afternoon. He dragged himselfinto the stern and sat up.  The boat was in the middle of the stream.The wooded banks, with their base-lines of flashing ice, were slippingby.  Near him floated a huge, uprooted pine.  A freak of the currentbrought the boat against it.  Crawling forward, he fastened the painterto a root.The tree, deeper in the water, was travelling faster, and the paintertautened as the boat took the tow.  Then, with a last giddy lookaround, wherein he saw the banks tilting and swaying and the sunswinging in pendulum-sweep across the sky, Daylight wrapped himself inhis rabbit-skin robe, lay down in the bottom, and fell asleep.When he awoke, it was dark night.  He was lying on his back, and hecould see the stars shining.  A subdued murmur of swollen waters couldbe heard.  A sharp jerk informed him that the boat, swerving slack intothe painter, had been straightened out by the swifter-moving pine tree.A piece of stray drift-ice thumped against the boat and grated alongits side.  Well, the following jam hadn't caught him yet, was histhought, as he closed his eyes and slept again.It was bright day when next he opened his eyes.  The sun showed it tobe midday.  A glance around at the far-away banks, and he knew that hewas on the mighty Yukon.  Sixty Mile could not be far away.  He wasabominably weak.  His movements were slow, fumbling, and inaccurate,accompanied by panting and head-swimming, as he dragged himself into asitting-up position in the stern, his rifle beside him.  He looked along time at Elijah, but could not see whether he breathed or not, andhe was too immeasurably far away to make an investigation.He fell to dreaming and meditating again, dreams and thoughts beingoften broken by sketches of blankness, wherein he neither slept, norwas unconscious, nor was aware of anything.  It seemed to him more likecogs slipping in his brain.  And in this intermittent way he reviewedthe situation.  He was still alive, and most likely would be saved, buthow came it that he was not lying dead across the boat on top theice-rim?  Then he recollected the great final effort he had made.  Butwhy had he made it?  he asked himself.  It had not been fear of death.He had not been afraid, that was sure.  Then he remembered the hunchand the big strike he believed was coming, and he knew that the spurhad been his desire to sit in for a hand at that big game. And againwhy?  What if he made his million?  He would die, just the same asthose that never won more than grub-stakes.  Then again why?  But theblank stretches in his thinking process began to come more frequently,and he surrendered to the delightful lassitude that was creeping overhim.He roused with a start.  Something had whispered in him that he mustawake.  Abruptly he saw Sixty Mile, not a hundred feet away.The current had brought him to the very door.  But the same current wasnow sweeping him past and on into the down-river wilderness.  No onewas in sight.  The place might have been deserted, save for the smokehe saw rising from the kitchen chimney.  He tried to call, but found hehad no voice left.  An unearthly guttural hiss alternately rattled andwheezed in his throat.  He fumbled for the rifle, got it to hisshoulder, and pulled the trigger.  The recoil of the discharge torethrough his frame, racking it with a thousand agonies.  The rifle hadfallen across his knees, and an attempt to lift it to his shoulderfailed.  He knew he must be quick, and felt that he was fainting, so hepulled the trigger of the gun where it lay.  This time it kicked offand overboard.  But just before darkness rushed over him, he saw thekitchen door open, and a woman look out of the big log house that wasdancing a monstrous jig among the trees.CHAPTER IXTen days later, Harper and Joe Ladue arrived at Sixty Mile, andDaylight, still a trifle weak, but strong enough to obey the hunch thathad come to him, traded a third interest in his Stewart town site for athird interest in theirs on the Klondike.They had faith in the Upper Country, and Harper left down-stream, witha raft-load of supplies, to start a small post at the mouth of theKlondike."Why don't you tackle Indian River, Daylight?" Harper advised, atparting.  "There's whole slathers of creeks and draws draining in upthere, and somewhere gold just crying to be found.  That's my hunch.There's a big strike coming, and Indian River ain't going to be amillion miles away.""And the place is swarming with moose," Joe Ladue added.  "BobHenderson's up there somewhere, been there three years now, swearingsomething big is going to happen, living off'n straight moose andprospecting around like a crazy man."Daylight decided to go Indian River a flutter, as he expressed it; butElijah could not be persuaded into accompanying him. Elijah's soul hadbeen seared by famine, and he was obsessed by fear of repeating theexperience."I jest can't bear to separate from grub," he explained.  "I know it'sdownright foolishness, but I jest can't help it.  It's all I can do totear myself away from the table when I know I'm full to bustin' andain't got storage for another bite.  I'm going back to Circle to campby a cache until I get cured."Daylight lingered a few days longer, gathering strength and arranginghis meagre outfit.  He planned to go in light, carrying a pack ofseventy-five pounds and making his five dogs pack as well, Indianfashion, loading them with thirty pounds each. Depending on the reportof Ladue, he intended to follow Bob Henderson's example and livepractically on straight meat.  When Jack Kearns' scow, laden with thesawmill from Lake Linderman, tied up at Sixty Mile, Daylight bundledhis outfit and dogs on board, turned his town-site application over toElijah to be filed, and the same day was landed at the mouth of IndianRiver.Forty miles up the river, at what had been described to him as QuartzCreek, he came upon signs of Bob Henderson's work, and also atAustralia Creek, thirty miles farther on.  The weeks came and went, butDaylight never encountered the other man.  However, he found mooseplentiful, and he and his dogs prospered on the meat diet.  He found"pay" that was no more than "wages" on a dozen surface bars, and fromthe generous spread of flour gold in the muck and gravel of a score ofcreeks, he was more confident than ever that coarse gold in quantitywas waiting to be unearthed.  Often he turned his eyes to the northwardridge of hills, and pondered if the gold came from them.  In the end,he ascended Dominion Creek to its head, crossed the divide, and camedown on the tributary to the Klondike that was later to be calledHunker Creek.  While on the divide, had he kept the big dome on hisright, he would have come down on the Gold Bottom, so named by BobHenderson, whom he would have found at work on it, taking out the firstpay-gold ever panned on the Klondike.  Instead, Daylight continued downHunker to the Klondike, and on to the summer fishing camp of theIndians on the Yukon.Here for a day he camped with Carmack, a squaw-man, and his Indianbrother-in-law, Skookum Jim, bought a boat, and, with his dogs onboard, drifted down the Yukon to Forty Mile.  August was drawing to aclose, the days were growing shorter, and winter was coming on.  Stillwith unbounded faith in his hunch that a strike was coming in the UpperCountry, his plan was to get together a party of four or five, and, ifthat was impossible, at least a partner, and to pole back up the riverbefore the freeze-up to do winter prospecting.  But the men of FortyMile were without faith.  The diggings to the westward were good enoughfor them.Then it was that Carmack, his brother-in-law, Skookum Jim, and CultusCharlie, another Indian, arrived in a canoe at Forty Mile, wentstraight to the gold commissioner, and recorded three claims and adiscovery claim on Bonanza Creek.  After that, in the Sourdough Saloon,that night, they exhibited coarse gold to the sceptical crowd.  Mengrinned and shook their heads.  They had seen the motions of a goldstrike gone through before.  This was too patently a scheme of Harper'sand Joe Ladue's, trying to entice prospecting in the vicinity of theirtown site and trading post.  And who was Carmack?  A squaw-man.  Andwho ever heard of a squaw-man striking anything?  And what was BonanzaCreek? Merely a moose pasture, entering the Klondike just above itsmouth, and known to old-timers as Rabbit Creek.  Now if Daylight or BobHenderson had recorded claims and shown coarse gold, they'd known therewas something in it.  But Carmack, the squaw-man! And Skookum Jim!  AndCultus Charlie!  No, no; that was asking too much.Daylight, too, was sceptical, and this despite his faith in the UpperCountry.  Had he not, only a few days before, seen Carmack loafing withhis Indians and with never a thought of prospecting?But at eleven that night, sitting on the edge of his bunk and unlacinghis moccasins, a thought came to him.  He put on his coat and hat andwent back to the Sourdough.  Carmack was still there, flashing hiscoarse gold in the eyes of an unbelieving generation.  Daylight rangedalongside of him and emptied Carmack's sack into a blower.  This hestudied for a long time. Then, from his own sack, into another blower,he emptied several ounces of Circle City and Forty Mile gold.  Again,for a long time, he studied and compared.  Finally, he pocketed his owngold, returned Carmack's, and held up his hand for silence."Boys, I want to tell you-all something," he said.  "She's surecome--the up-river strike.  And I tell you-all, clear and forcible,this is it.  There ain't never been gold like that in a blower in thiscountry before.  It's new gold.  It's got more silver in it.  You-allcan see it by the color.  Carmack's sure made a strike.  Who-all's gotfaith to come along with me?"There were no volunteers.  Instead, laughter and jeers went up."Mebbe you got a town site up there," some one suggested."I sure have," was the retort, "and a third interest in Harper andLadue's.  And I can see my corner lots selling out for more than yourhen-scratching ever turned up on Birch Creek.""That's all right, Daylight," one Curly Parson interposed soothingly."You've got a reputation, and we know you're dead sure on the square.But you're as likely as any to be mistook on a flimflam game, such asthese loafers is putting up.  I ask you straight: When did Carmack dothis here prospecting?  You said yourself he was lying in camp, fishingsalmon along with his Siwash relations, and that was only the otherday.""And Daylight told the truth," Carmack interrupted excitedly. "And I'mtelling the truth, the gospel truth.  I wasn't prospecting.  Hadn't noidea of it.  But when Daylight pulls out, the very same day, who driftsin, down river, on a raft-load of supplies, but Bob Henderson.  He'dcome out to Sixty Mile, planning to go back up Indian River and portagethe grub across the divide between Quartz Creek and Gold Bottom--""Where in hell's Gold Bottom?" Curly Parsons demanded."Over beyond Bonanza that was Rabbit Creek," the squaw-man went on."It's a draw of a big creek that runs into the Klondike. That's the wayI went up, but I come back by crossing the divide, keeping along thecrest several miles, and dropping down into Bonanza.  'Come along withme, Carmack, and get staked,' says Bob Henderson to me.  'I've hit itthis time, on Gold Bottom.  I've took out forty-five ounces already.'And I went along, Skookum Jim and Cultus Charlie, too.  And we allstaked on Gold Bottom. I come back by Bonanza on the chance of findinga moose.  Along down Bonanza we stopped and cooked grub.  I went tosleep, and what does Skookum Jim do but try his hand at prospecting.He'd been watching Henderson, you see.  He goes right slap up to thefoot of a birch tree, first pan, fills it with dirt, and washes outmore'n a dollar coarse gold.  Then he wakes me up, and I goes at it.  Igot two and a half the first lick.  Then I named the creek 'Bonanza,'staked Discovery, and we come here and recorded."He looked about him anxiously for signs of belief, but found himself ina circle of incredulous faces--all save Daylight, who had studied hiscountenance while he told his story."How much is Harper and Ladue givin' you for manufacturing a stampede?"some one asked."They don't know nothing about it," Carmack answered.  "I tell you it'sthe God Almighty's truth.  I washed out three ounces in an hour.""And there's the gold," Daylight said.  "I tell you-all boys they ain'tnever been gold like that in the blower before.  Look at the color ofit.""A trifle darker," Curly Parson said.  "Most likely Carmack's beencarrying a couple of silver dollars along in the same sack. And what'smore, if there's anything in it, why ain't Bob Henderson smoking alongto record?""He's up on Gold Bottom," Carmack explained.  "We made the strikecoming back."A burst of laughter was his reward."Who-all'll go pardners with me and pull out in a poling-boat to-morrowfor this here Bonanza?" Daylight asked.No one volunteered."Then who-all'll take a job from me, cash wages in advance, to pole upa thousand pounds of grub?"Curly Parsons and another, Pat Monahan, accepted, and, with hiscustomary speed, Daylight paid them their wages in advance and arrangedthe purchase of the supplies, though he emptied his sack in doing so.He was leaving the Sourdough, when he suddenly turned back to the barfrom the door."Got another hunch?" was the query."I sure have," he answered.  "Flour's sure going to be worth what a manwill pay for it this winter up on the Klondike.  Who'll lend me somemoney?"On the instant a score of the men who had declined to accompany him onthe wild-goose chase were crowding about him with proffered gold-sacks."How much flour do you want?" asked the Alaska Commercial Company'sstorekeeper."About two ton."The proffered gold-sacks were not withdrawn, though their owners wereguilty of an outrageous burst of merriment."What are you going to do with two tons?" the store-keeper demanded."Son," Daylight made reply, "you-all ain't been in this country longenough to know all its curves.  I'm going to start a sauerkraut factoryand combined dandruff remedy."He borrowed money right and left, engaging and paying six other men tobring up the flour in half as many more poling-boats. Again his sackwas empty, and he was heavily in debt.Curly Parsons bowed his head on the bar with a gesture of despair."What gets me," he moaned, "is what you're going to do with it all.""I'll tell you-all in simple A, B, C and one, two, three." Daylightheld up one finger and began checking off.  "Hunch number one: a bigstrike coming in Upper Country.  Hunch number two: Carmack's made it.Hunch number three: ain't no hunch at all.  It's a cinch.  If one andtwo is right, then flour just has to go sky-high.  If I'm ridinghunches one and two, I just got to ride this cinch, which is numberthree.  If I'm right, flour'll balance gold on the scales this winter.I tell you-all boys, when you-all got a hunch, play it for all it'sworth.  What's luck good for, if you-all ain't to ride it?  And whenyou-all ride it, ride like hell.  I've been years in this country, justwaiting for the right hunch to come along.  And here she is. Well, I'mgoing to play her, that's all.  Good night, you-all; good night."CHAPTER XStill men were without faith in the strike.  When Daylight, with hisheavy outfit of flour, arrived at the mouth of the Klondike, he foundthe big flat as desolate and tenantless as ever.  Down close by theriver, Chief Isaac and his Indians were camped beside the frames onwhich they were drying salmon. Several old-timers were also in campthere.  Having finished their summer work on Ten Mile Creek, they hadcome down the Yukon, bound for Circle City.  But at Sixty Mile they hadlearned of the strike, and stopped off to look over the ground.  Theyhad just returned to their boat when Daylight landed his flour, andtheir report was pessimistic."Damned moose-pasture," quoth one, Long Jim Harney, pausing to blowinto his tin mug of tea.  "Don't you have nothin' to do with it,Daylight.  It's a blamed rotten sell.  They're just going through themotions of a strike.  Harper and Ladue's behind it, and Carmack's thestool-pigeon.  Whoever heard of mining a moose-pasture half a milebetween rim-rock and God alone knows how far to bed-rock!"Daylight nodded sympathetically, and considered for a space."Did you-all pan any?" he asked finally."Pan hell!" was the indignant answer.  "Think I was born yesterday!Only a chechaquo'd fool around that pasture long enough to fill a panof dirt.  You don't catch me at any such foolishness.  One look wasenough for me.  We're pulling on in the morning for Circle City.  Iain't never had faith in this Upper Country.  Head-reaches of theTanana is good enough for me from now on, and mark my words, when thebig strike comes, she'll come down river.  Johnny, here, staked acouple of miles below Discovery, but he don't know no better."  Johnnylooked shamefaced."I just did it for fun," he explained.  "I'd give my chance in thecreek for a pound of Star plug.""I'll go you," Daylight said promptly.  "But don't you-all comesquealing if I take twenty or thirty thousand out of it."Johnny grinned cheerfully."Gimme the tobacco," he said."Wish I'd staked alongside," Long Jim murmured plaintively."It ain't too late," Daylight replied."But it's a twenty-mile walk there and back.""I'll stake it for you to-morrow when I go up," Daylight offered."Then you do the same as Johnny.  Get the fees from Tim Logan. He'stending bar in the Sourdough, and he'll lend it to me.  Then fill inyour own name, transfer to me, and turn the papers over to Tim.""Me, too," chimed in the third old-timer.And for three pounds of Star plug chewing tobacco, Daylight boughtoutright three five-hundred-foot claims on Bonanza.  He could stillstake another claim in his own name, the others being merely transfers."Must say you're almighty brash with your chewin' tobacco," Long Jimgrinned.  "Got a factory somewheres?""Nope, but I got a hunch," was the retort, "and I tell you-all it'scheaper than dirt to ride her at the rate of three plugs for threeclaims."But an hour later, at his own camp, Joe Ladue strode in, fresh fromBonanza Creek.  At first, non-committal over Carmack's strike, then,later, dubious, he finally offered Daylight a hundred dollars for hisshare in the town site."Cash?" Daylight queried."Sure.  There she is."So saying, Ladue pulled out his gold-sack.  Daylight hefted itabsent-mindedly, and, still absent-mindedly, untied the strings and ransome of the gold-dust out on his palm.  It showed darker than any dusthe had ever seen, with the exception of Carmack's. He ran the gold backtied the mouth of the sack, and returned it to Ladue."I guess you-all need it more'n I do," was Daylight's comment."Nope; got plenty more," the other assured him."Where that come from?"Daylight was all innocence as he asked the question, and Ladue receivedthe question as stolidly as an Indian.  Yet for a swift instant theylooked into each other's eyes, and in that instant an intangiblesomething seemed to flash out from all the body and spirit of JoeLadue.  And it seemed to Daylight that he had caught this flash, senseda secret something in the knowledge and plans behind the other's eyes."You-all know the creek better'n me," Daylight went on.  "And if myshare in the town site's worth a hundred to you-all with what you-allknow, it's worth a hundred to me whether I know it or not.""I'll give you three hundred," Ladue offered desperately."Still the same reasoning.  No matter what I don't know, it's worth tome whatever you-all are willing to pay for it."Then it was that Joe Ladue shamelessly gave over.  He led Daylight awayfrom the camp and men and told him things in confidence."She's sure there," he said in conclusion.  "I didn't sluice it, orcradle it.  I panned it, all in that sack, yesterday, on the rim-rock.I tell you, you can shake it out of the grassroots. And what's onbed-rock down in the bottom of the creek they ain't no way of tellin'.But she's big, I tell you, big.  Keep it quiet, and locate all you can.It's in spots, but I wouldn't be none surprised if some of them claimsyielded as high as fifty thousand.  The only trouble is that it'sspotted."                         *   *  *A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.  A sprinkling ofmen had staked; but most of them, after staking, had gone on down toForty Mile and Circle City.  The few that possessed sufficient faith toremain were busy building log cabins against the coming of winter.Carmack and his Indian relatives were occupied in building a sluice boxand getting a head of water.  The work was slow, for they had to sawtheir lumber by hand from the standing forest.  But farther downBonanza were four men who had drifted in from up river, Dan McGilvary,Dave McKay, Dave Edwards, and Harry Waugh.  They were a quiet party,neither asking nor giving confidences, and they herded by themselves.But Daylight, who had panned the spotted rim of Carmack's claim andshaken coarse gold from the grass-roots, and who had panned the rim ata hundred other places up and down the length of the creek and foundnothing, was curious to know what lay on bed-rock.  He had noted thefour quiet men sinking a shaft close by the stream, and he had heardtheir whip-saw going as they made lumber for the sluice boxes. He didnot wait for an invitation, but he was present the first day theysluiced.  And at the end of five hours' shovelling for one man, he sawthem take out thirteen ounces and a half of gold.It was coarse gold, running from pinheads to a twelve-dollar nugget,and it had come from off bed-rock.  The first fall snow was flying thatday, and the Arctic winter was closing down; but Daylight had no eyesfor the bleak-gray sadness of the dying, short-lived summer.  He sawhis vision coming true, and on the big flat was upreared anew hisgolden city of the snows.  Gold had been found on bed-rock.  That wasthe big thing.  Carmack's strike was assured.  Daylight staked a claimin his own name adjoining the three he had purchased with his plugtobacco.  This gave him a block of property two thousand feet long andextending in width from rim-rock to rim-rock.Returning that night to his camp at the mouth of Klondike, he found init Kama, the Indian he had left at Dyea.  Kama was travelling by canoe,bringing in the last mail of the year.  In his possession was some twohundred dollars in gold-dust, which Daylight immediately borrowed.  Inreturn, he arranged to stake a claim for him, which he was to recordwhen he passed through Forty Mile.  When Kama departed next morning, hecarried a number of letters for Daylight, addressed to all theold-timers down river, in which they were urged to come up immediatelyand stake.Also Kama carried letters of similar import, given him by the other menon Bonanza."It will sure be the gosh-dangdest stampede that ever was," Daylightchuckled, as he tried to vision the excited populations of Forty Mileand Circle City tumbling into poling-boats and racing the hundreds ofmiles up the Yukon; for he knew that his word would be unquestioninglyaccepted.With the arrival of the first stampeders, Bonanza Creek woke up, andthereupon began a long-distance race between unveracity and truth,wherein, lie no matter how fast, men were continually overtaken andpassed by truth.  When men who doubted Carmack's report of two and ahalf to the pan, themselves panned two and a half, they lied and saidthat they were getting an ounce.  And long ere the lie was fairly onits way, they were getting not one ounce but five ounces.  This theyclaimed was ten ounces; but when they filled a pan of dirt to prove thelie, they washed out twelve ounces.  And so it went.  They continuedvaliantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.One day in December Daylight filled a pan from bed rock on his ownclaim and carried it into his cabin.  Here a fire burned and enabledhim to keep water unfrozen in a canvas tank.  He squatted over the tankand began to wash.  Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.  As heimparted to it a circular movement, the lighter, coarser particleswashed out over the edge.  At times he combed the surface with hisfingers, raking out handfuls of gravel.  The contents of the pandiminished.  As it drew near to the bottom, for the purpose of fleetingand tentative examination, he gave the pan a sudden sloshing movement,emptying it of water.  And the whole bottom showed as if covered withbutter.  Thus the yellow gold flashed up as the muddy water was flirtedaway.  It was gold--gold-dust, coarse gold, nuggets, large nuggets.  Hewas all alone.  He set the pan down for a moment and thought longthoughts.  Then he finished the washing, and weighed the result in hisscales.  At the rate of sixteen dollars to the ounce, the pan hadcontained seven hundred and odd dollars.  It was beyond anything thateven he had dreamed.  His fondest anticipation's had gone no fartherthan twenty or thirty thousand dollars to a claim; but here were claimsworth half a million each at the least, even if they were spotted.He did not go back to work in the shaft that day, nor the next, nor thenext.  Instead, capped and mittened, a light stampeding outfit,including his rabbit skin robe, strapped on his back, he was out andaway on a many-days' tramp over creeks and divides, inspecting thewhole neighboring territory.  On each creek he was entitled to locateone claim, but he was chary in thus surrendering up his chances.  OnHunker Creek only did he stake a claim.  Bonanza Creek he found stakedfrom mouth to source, while every little draw and pup and gulch thatdrained into it was like-wise staked.  Little faith was had in theseside-streams. They had been staked by the hundreds of men who hadfailed to get in on Bonanza.  The most popular of these creeks wasAdams.  The one least fancied was Eldorado, which flowed into Bonanza,just above Karmack's Discovery claim.  Even Daylight disliked the looksof Eldorado; but, still riding his hunch, he bought a half share in oneclaim on it for half a sack of flour.  A month later he paid eighthundred dollars for the adjoining claim.  Three months later, enlargingthis block of property, he paid forty thousand for a third claim; and,though it was concealed in the future, he was destined, not long after,to pay one hundred and fifty thousand for a fourth claim on the creekthat had been the least liked of all the creeks.In the meantime, and from the day he washed seven hundred dollars froma single pan and squatted over it and thought a long thought, he neveragain touched hand to pick and shovel.  As he said to Joe Ladue thenight of that wonderful washing:--"Joe, I ain't never going to work hard again.  Here's where I begin touse my brains.  I'm going to farm gold.  Gold will grow gold if you-allhave the savvee and can get hold of some for seed.  When I seen themseven hundred dollars in the bottom of the pan, I knew I had the seedat last.""Where are you going to plant it?" Joe Ladue had asked.And Daylight, with a wave of his hand, definitely indicated the wholelandscape and the creeks that lay beyond the divides."There she is," he said, "and you-all just watch my smoke. There'smillions here for the man who can see them.  And I seen all themmillions this afternoon when them seven hundred dollars peeped up at mefrom the bottom of the pan and chirruped, 'Well, if here ain't BurningDaylight come at last.'"CHAPTER XIThe hero of the Yukon in the younger days before the Carmack strike,Burning Daylight now became the hero of the strike.  The story of hishunch and how he rode it was told up and down the land.  Certainly hehad ridden it far and away beyond the boldest, for no five of theluckiest held the value in claims that he held.  And, furthermore, hewas still riding the hunch, and with no diminution of daring.  The wiseones shook their heads and prophesied that he would lose every ounce hehad won. He was speculating, they contended, as if the whole countrywas made of gold, and no man could win who played a placer strike inthat fashion.On the other hand, his holdings were reckoned as worth millions, andthere were men so sanguine that they held the man a fool whocoppered[6] any bet Daylight laid.  Behind his magnificentfree-handedness and careless disregard for money were hard, practicaljudgment, imagination and vision, and the daring of the big gambler.He foresaw what with his own eyes he had never seen, and he played towin much or lose all."There's too much gold here in Bonanza to be just a pocket," he argued."It's sure come from a mother-lode somewhere, and other creeks willshow up.  You-all keep your eyes on Indian River. The creeks that drainthat side the Klondike watershed are just as likely to have gold as thecreeks that drain this side."And he backed this opinion to the extent of grub-staking half a dozenparties of prospectors across the big divide into the Indian Riverregion.  Other men, themselves failing to stake on lucky creeks, he putto work on his Bonanza claims.  And he paid them well--sixteen dollarsa day for an eight-hour shift, and he ran three shifts.  He had grub tostart them on, and when, on the last water, the Bella arrived loadedwith provisions, he traded a warehouse site to Jack Kearns for a supplyof grub that lasted all his men through the winter of 1896.  And thatwinter, when famine pinched, and flour sold for two dollars a pound, hekept three shifts of men at work on all four of the Bonanza claims.Other mine-owners paid fifteen dollars a day to their men; but he hadbeen the first to put men to work, and from the first he paid them afull ounce a day.  One result was that his were picked men, and theymore than earned their higher pay.One of his wildest plays took place in the early winter after thefreeze-up.  Hundreds of stampeders, after staking on other creeks thanBonanza, had gone on disgruntled down river to Forty Mile and CircleCity.  Daylight mortgaged one of his Bonanza dumps with the AlaskaCommercial Company, and tucked a letter of credit into his pouch.  Thenhe harnessed his dogs and went down on the ice at a pace that only hecould travel.  One Indian down, another Indian back, and four teams ofdogs was his record.  And at Forty Mile and Circle City he boughtclaims by the score. Many of these were to prove utterly worthless, butsome few of them were to show up more astoundingly than any on Bonanza.He bought right and left, paying as low as fifty dollars and as high asfive thousand.  This highest one he bought in the Tivoli Saloon.  Itwas an upper claim on Eldorado, and when he agreed to the price, JacobWilkins, an old-timer just returned from a look at the moose-pasture,got up and left the room, saying:--"Daylight, I've known you seven year, and you've always seemed sensibletill now.  And now you're just letting them rob you right and left.That's what it is--robbery.  Five thousand for a claim on that damnedmoose-pasture is bunco.  I just can't stay in the room and see youbuncoed that way.""I tell you-all," Daylight answered, "Wilkins, Carmack's strike's sobig that we-all can't see it all.  It's a lottery.  Every claim I buyis a ticket.  And there's sure going to be some capital prizes."Jacob Wilkins, standing in the open door, sniffed incredulously."Now supposing, Wilkins," Daylight went on, "supposing you-all knew itwas going to rain soup.  What'd you-all do?  Buy spoons, of course.Well, I'm sure buying spoons.  She's going to rain soup up there on theKlondike, and them that has forks won't be catching none of it."But Wilkins here slammed the door behind him, and Daylight broke off tofinish the purchase of the claim.Back in Dawson, though he remained true to his word and never touchedhand to pick and shovel, he worked as hard as ever in his life.  He hada thousand irons in the fire, and they kept him busy.  Representationwork was expensive, and he was compelled to travel often over thevarious creeks in order to decide which claims should lapse and whichshould be retained.  A quartz miner himself in his early youth, beforecoming to Alaska, he dreamed of finding the mother-lode.  A placer camphe knew was ephemeral, while a quartz camp abided, and he kept a scoreof men in the quest for months.  The mother-lode was never found, and,years afterward, he estimated that the search for it had cost him fiftythousand dollars.But he was playing big.  Heavy as were his expenses, he won moreheavily.  He took lays, bought half shares, shared with the men hegrub-staked, and made personal locations.  Day and night his dogs wereready, and he owned the fastest teams; so that when a stampede to a newdiscovery was on, it was Burning Daylight to the fore through thelongest, coldest nights till he blazed his stakes next to Discovery.In one way or another (to say nothing of the many worthless creeks) hecame into possession of properties on the good creeks, such as Sulphur,Dominion, Excelsis, Siwash, Cristo, Alhambra, and Doolittle.  Thethousands he poured out flowed back in tens of thousands.  Forty Milemen told the story of his two tons of flour, and made calculations ofwhat it had returned him that ranged from half a million to a million.One thing was known beyond all doubt, namely, that the half share inthe first Eldorado claim, bought by him for a half sack of flour, wasworth five hundred thousand.  On the other hand, it was told that whenFreda, the dancer, arrived from over the passes in a Peterborough canoein the midst of a drive of mush-ice on the Yukon, and when she offereda thousand dollars for ten sacks and could find no sellers, he sent theflour to her as a present without ever seeing her.  In the same way tensacks were sent to the lone Catholic priest who was starting the firsthospital.His generosity was lavish.  Others called it insane.  At a time when,riding his hunch, he was getting half a million for half a sack offlour, it was nothing less than insanity to give twenty whole sacks toa dancing-girl and a priest.  But it was his way. Money was only amarker.  It was the game that counted with him. The possession ofmillions made little change in him, except that he played the game morepassionately.  Temperate as he had always been, save on rare occasions,now that he had the wherewithal for unlimited drinks and had dailyaccess to them, he drank even less.  The most radical change lay inthat, except when on trail, he no longer did his own cooking.  Abroken-down miner lived in his log cabin with him and now cooked forhim.  But it was the same food: bacon, beans, flour, prunes, driedfruits, and rice. He still dressed as formerly: overalls, German socks,moccasins, flannel shirt, fur cap, and blanket coat.  He did not takeup with cigars, which cost, the cheapest, from half a dollar to adollar each.  The same Bull Durham and brown-paper cigarette,hand-rolled, contented him.  It was true that he kept more dogs, andpaid enormous prices for them.  They were not a luxury, but a matter ofbusiness.  He needed speed in his travelling and stampeding.  And bythe same token, he hired a cook.  He was too busy to cook for himself,that was all.  It was poor business, playing for millions, to spendtime building fires and boiling water.Dawson grew rapidly that winter of 1896.  Money poured in on Daylightfrom the sale of town lots.  He promptly invested it where it wouldgather more.  In fact, he played the dangerous game of pyramiding, andno more perilous pyramiding than in a placer camp could be imagined.But he played with his eyes wide open."You-all just wait till the news of this strike reaches the Outside,"he told his old-timer cronies in the Moosehorn Saloon. "The news won'tget out till next spring.  Then there's going to be three rushes.  Asummer rush of men coming in light; a fall rush of men with outfits;and a spring rush, the next year after that, of fifty thousand.You-all won't be able to see the landscape for chechaquos.  Well,there's the summer and fall rush of 1897 to commence with.  What areyou-all going to do about it?""What are you going to do about it?" a friend demanded."Nothing," he answered.  "I've sure already done it.  I've got a dozengangs strung out up the Yukon getting out logs.  You-all'll see theirrafts coming down after the river breaks.  Cabins! They sure will beworth what a man can pay for them next fall. Lumber! It will sure go totop-notch.  I've got two sawmills freighting in over the passes.They'll come down as soon as the lakes open up.  And if you-all arethinking of needing lumber, I'll make you-all contracts rightnow--three hundred dollars a thousand, undressed."Corner lots in desirable locations sold that winter for from ten tothirty thousand dollars.  Daylight sent word out over the trails andpasses for the newcomers to bring down log-rafts, and, as a result, thesummer of 1897 saw his sawmills working day and night, on three shifts,and still he had logs left over with which to build cabins.  Thesecabins, land included, sold at from one to several thousand dollars.Two-story log buildings, in the business part of town, brought him fromforty to fifty thousand dollars apiece.  These fresh accretions ofcapital were immediately invested in other ventures.  He turned goldover and over, until everything that he touched seemed to turn to gold.But that first wild winter of Carmack's strike taught Daylight manythings.  Despite the prodigality of his nature, he had poise.  Hewatched the lavish waste of the mushroom millionaires, and failed quiteto understand it.  According to his nature and outlook, it was all verywell to toss an ante away in a night's frolic.  That was what he haddone the night of the poker-game in Circle City when he lost fiftythousand--all that he possessed. But he had looked on that fiftythousand as a mere ante.  When it came to millions, it was different.Such a fortune was a stake, and was not to be sown on bar-room floors,literally sown, flung broadcast out of the moosehide sacks by drunkenmillionaires who had lost all sense of proportion.  There was McMann,who ran up a single bar-room bill of thirty-eight thousand dollars; andJimmie the Rough, who spent one hundred thousand a month for fourmonths in riotous living, and then fell down drunk in the snow oneMarch night and was frozen to death; and Swiftwater Bill, who, afterspending three valuable claims in an extravagance of debauchery,borrowed three thousand dollars with which to leave the country, andwho, out of this sum, because the lady-love that had jilted him likedeggs, cornered the one hundred and ten dozen eggs on the Dawson market,paying twenty-four dollars a dozen for them and promptly feeding themto the wolf-dogs.Champagne sold at from forty to fifty dollars a quart, and cannedoyster stew at fifteen dollars.  Daylight indulged in no such luxuries.He did not mind treating a bar-room of men to whiskey at fifty cents adrink, but there was somewhere in his own extravagant nature a sense offitness and arithmetic that revolted against paying fifteen dollars forthe contents of an oyster can.  On the other hand, he possibly spentmore money in relieving hard-luck cases than did the wildest of the newmillionaires on insane debauchery.  Father Judge, of the hospital,could have told of far more important donations than that first tensacks of flour.  And old-timers who came to Daylight invariably wentaway relieved according to their need. But fifty dollars for a quart offizzy champagne!  That was appalling.And yet he still, on occasion, made one of his old-time hell-roaringnights.  But he did so for different reasons. First, it was expected ofhim because it had been his way in the old days.  And second, he couldafford it.  But he no longer cared quite so much for that form ofdiversion.  He had developed, in a new way, the taste for power.  Ithad become a lust with him.  By far the wealthiest miner in Alaska, hewanted to be still wealthier.  It was a big game he was playing in, andhe liked it better than any other game.  In a way, the part he playedwas creative.  He was doing something.  And at no time, strikinganother chord of his nature, could he take the joy in a million-dollarEldorado dump that was at all equivalent to the joy he took in watchinghis two sawmills working and the big down river log-rafts swinging intothe bank in the big eddy just above Moosehide Mountain.  Gold, even onthe scales, was, after all, an abstraction.  It represented things andthe power to do.  But the sawmills were the things themselves, concreteand tangible, and they were things that were a means to the doing ofmore things. They were dreams come true, hard and indubitablerealizations of fairy gossamers.With the summer rush from the Outside came special correspondents forthe big newspapers and magazines, and one and all, using unlimitedspace, they wrote Daylight up; so that, so far as the world wasconcerned, Daylight loomed the largest figure in Alaska.  Of course,after several months, the world became interested in the Spanish War,and forgot all about him; but in the Klondike itself Daylight stillremained the most prominent figure.  Passing along the streets ofDawson, all heads turned to follow him, and in the saloons chechaquoswatched him awesomely, scarcely taking their eyes from him as long ashe remained in their range of vision.  Not alone was he the richest manin the country, but he was Burning Daylight, the pioneer, the man who,almost in the midst of antiquity of that young land, had crossed theChilcoot and drifted down the Yukon to meet those elder giants, Al Mayoand Jack McQuestion.  He was the Burning Daylight of scores of wildadventures, the man who carried word to the ice-bound whaling fleetacross the tundra wilderness to the Arctic Sea, who raced the mail fromCircle to Salt Water and back again in sixty days, who saved the wholeTanana tribe from perishing in the winter of '91--in short, the man whosmote the chechaquos' imaginations more violently than any other dozenmen rolled into one.He had the fatal facility for self-advertisement.  Things he did, nomatter how adventitious or spontaneous, struck the popular imaginationas remarkable.  And the latest thing he had done was always on men'slips, whether it was being first in the heartbreaking stampede toDanish Creek, in killing the record baldface grizzly over on SulphurCreek, or in winning the single-paddle canoe race on the Queen'sBirthday, after being forced to participate at the last moment by thefailure of the sourdough representative to appear.  Thus, one night inthe Moosehorn, he locked horns with Jack Kearns in the long-promisedreturn game of poker.  The sky and eight o'clock in the morning weremade the limits, and at the close of the game Daylight's winnings weretwo hundred and thirty thousand dollars.  To Jack Kearns, already aseveral-times millionaire, this loss was not vital.  But the wholecommunity was thrilled by the size of the stakes, and each one of thedozen correspondents in the field sent out a sensational article.[6] To copper: a term in faro, meaning to play a card to lose.CHAPTER XIIDespite his many sources of revenue, Daylight's pyramiding kept himpinched for cash throughout the first winter.  The pay-gravel, thawedon bed-rock and hoisted to the surface, immediately froze again.  Thushis dumps, containing several millions of gold, were inaccessible.  Notuntil the returning sun thawed the dumps and melted the water to washthem was he able to handle the gold they contained.  And then he foundhimself with a surplus of gold, deposited in the two newly organizedbanks; and he was promptly besieged by men and groups of men to enlisthis capital in their enterprises.But he elected to play his own game, and he entered combinations onlywhen they were generally defensive or offensive.  Thus, though he hadpaid the highest wages, he joined the Mine-owners' Association,engineered the fight, and effectually curbed the growinginsubordination of the wage-earners.  Times had changed. The old dayswere gone forever.  This was a new era, and Daylight, the wealthymine-owner, was loyal to his class affiliations.  It was true, theold-timers who worked for him, in order to be saved from the club ofthe organized owners, were made foremen over the gang of chechaquos;but this, with Daylight, was a matter of heart, not head.  In his hearthe could not forget the old days, while with his head he played theeconomic game according to the latest and most practical methods.But outside of such group-combinations of exploiters, he refused tobind himself to any man's game.  He was playing a great lone hand, andhe needed all his money for his own backing.  The newly foundedstock-exchange interested him keenly.  He had never before seen such aninstitution, but he was quick to see its virtues and to utilize it.Most of all, it was gambling, and on many an occasion not necessary forthe advancement of his own schemes, he, as he called it, went thestock-exchange a flutter, out of sheer wantonness and fun."It sure beats faro," was his comment one day, when, after keeping theDawson speculators in a fever for a week by alternate bulling andbearing, he showed his hand and cleaned up what would have been afortune to any other man.Other men, having made their strike, had headed south for the States,taking a furlough from the grim Arctic battle.  But, asked when he wasgoing Outside, Daylight always laughed and said when he had finishedplaying his hand.  He also added that a man was a fool to quit a gamejust when a winning hand had been dealt him.It was held by the thousands of hero-worshipping chechaquos thatDaylight was a man absolutely without fear.  But Bettles and DanMacDonald and other sourdoughs shook their heads and laughed as theymentioned women.  And they were right.  He had always been afraid ofthem from the time, himself a lad of seventeen, when Queen Anne, ofJuneau, made open and ridiculous love to him.  For that matter, henever had known women.  Born in a mining-camp where they were rare andmysterious, having no sisters, his mother dying while he was an infant,he had never been in contact with them.  True, running away from QueenAnne, he had later encountered them on the Yukon and cultivated anacquaintance with them--the pioneer ones who crossed the passes on thetrail of the men who had opened up the first diggings.  But no lamb hadever walked with a wolf in greater fear and trembling than had hewalked with them.  It was a matter of masculine pride that he shouldwalk with them, and he had done so in fair seeming; but women hadremained to him a closed book, and he preferred a game of solo orseven-up any time.And now, known as the King of the Klondike, carrying several otherroyal titles, such as Eldorado King, Bonanza King, the Lumber Baron,and the Prince of the Stampeders, not to omit the proudest appellationof all, namely, the Father of the Sourdoughs, he was more afraid ofwomen than ever.  As never before they held out their arms to him, andmore women were flocking into the country day by day.  It mattered notwhether he sat at dinner in the gold commissioner's house, called forthe drinks in a dancehall, or submitted to an interview from the womanrepresentative of the New York Sun, one and all of them held out theirarms.There was one exception, and that was Freda, the girl that danced, andto whom he had given the flour.  She was the only woman in whosecompany he felt at ease, for she alone never reached out her arms.  Andyet it was from her that he was destined to receive next to hisseverest fright.  It came about in the fall of 1897.  He was returningfrom one of his dashes, this time to inspect Henderson, a creek thatentered the Yukon just below the Stewart.  Winter had come on with arush, and he fought his way down the Yukon seventy miles in a frailPeterborough canoe in the midst of a run of mush-ice.  Hugging therim-ice that had already solidly formed, he shot across the ice-spewingmouth of the Klondike just in time to see a lone man dancing excitedlyon the rim and pointing into the water.  Next, he saw the fur-clad bodyof a woman, face under, sinking in the midst of the driving mush-ice.A lane opening in the swirl of the current, it was a matter of secondsto drive the canoe to the spot, reach to the shoulder in the water, anddraw the woman gingerly to the canoe's side.  It was Freda.  And allmight yet have been well with him, had she not, later, when broughtback to consciousness, blazed at him with angry blue eyes and demanded:"Why did you?  Oh, why did you?"This worried him.  In the nights that followed, instead of sinkingimmediately to sleep as was his wont, he lay awake, visioning her faceand that blue blaze of wrath, and conning her words over and over.They rang with sincerity.  The reproach was genuine.  She had meantjust what she said.  And still he pondered.The next time he encountered her she had turned away from him angrilyand contemptuously.  And yet again, she came to him to beg his pardon,and she dropped a hint of a man somewhere, sometime,--she said nothow,--who had left her with no desire to live.  Her speech was frank,but incoherent, and all he gleaned from it was that the event, whateverit was, had happened years before.  Also, he gleaned that she had lovedthe man.That was the thing--love.  It caused the trouble.  It was more terriblethan frost or famine.  Women were all very well, in themselves good tolook upon and likable; but along came this thing called love, and theywere seared to the bone by it, made so irrational that one could neverguess what they would do next.This Freda-woman was a splendid creature, full-bodied, beautiful, andnobody's fool; but love had come along and soured her on the world,driving her to the Klondike and to suicide so compellingly that she wasmade to hate the man that saved her life.Well, he had escaped love so far, just as he had escaped smallpox; yetthere it was, as contagious as smallpox, and a whole lot worse inrunning its course.  It made men and women do such fearful andunreasonable things.  It was like delirium tremens, only worse.  And ifhe, Daylight, caught it, he might have it as badly as any of them.  Itwas lunacy, stark lunacy, and contagious on top of it all.  A halfdozen young fellows were crazy over Freda.  They all wanted to marryher.  Yet she, in turn, was crazy over that some other fellow on theother side of the world, and would have nothing to do with them.But it was left to the Virgin to give him his final fright.  She wasfound one morning dead in her cabin.  A shot through the head had doneit, and she had left no message, no explanation.  Then came the talk.Some wit, voicing public opinion, called it a case of too muchDaylight.  She had killed herself because of him.  Everybody knew this,and said so.  The correspondents wrote it up, and once more BurningDaylight, King of the Klondike, was sensationally featured in theSunday supplements of the United States.  The Virgin had straightenedup, so the feature-stories ran, and correctly so.  Never had sheentered a Dawson City dance-hall.  When she first arrived from CircleCity, she had earned her living by washing clothes.  Next, she hadbought a sewing-machine and made men's drill parkas, fur caps, andmoosehide mittens.  Then she had gone as a clerk into the First YukonBank.  All this, and more, was known and told, though one and all wereagreed that Daylight, while the cause, had been the innocent cause ofher untimely end.And the worst of it was that Daylight knew it was true.  Always wouldhe remember that last night he had seen her.  He had thought nothing ofit at the time; but, looking back, he was haunted by every little thingthat had happened.  In the light of the tragic event, he couldunderstand everything--her quietness, that calm certitude as if allvexing questions of living had been smoothed out and were gone, andthat certain ethereal sweetness about all that she had said and donethat had been almost maternal.  He remembered the way she had looked athim, how she had laughed when he narrated Mickey Dolan's mistake instaking the fraction on Skookum Gulch.  Her laughter had been lightlyjoyous, while at the same time it had lacked its oldtime robustness.Not that she had been grave or subdued.  On the contrary, she had beenso patently content, so filled with peace.She had fooled him, fool that he was.  He had even thought that nightthat her feeling for him had passed, and he had taken delight in thethought, and caught visions of the satisfying future friendship thatwould be theirs with this perturbing love out of the way.And then, when he stood at the door, cap in hand, and said good night.It had struck him at the time as a funny and embarrassing thing, herbending over his hand and kissing it.  He had felt like a fool, but heshivered now when he looked back on it and felt again the touch of herlips on his hand.  She was saying good-by, an eternal good-by, and hehad never guessed.  At that very moment, and for all the moments of theevening, coolly and deliberately, as he well knew her way, she had beenresolved to die.  If he had only known it!  Untouched by the contagiousmalady himself, nevertheless he would have married her if he had hadthe slightest inkling of what she contemplated.  And yet he knew,furthermore, that hers was a certain stiff-kneed pride that would nothave permitted her to accept marriage as an act of philanthropy.  Therehad really been no saving her, after all. The love-disease had fastenedupon her, and she had been doomed from the first to perish of it.Her one possible chance had been that he, too, should have caught it.And he had failed to catch it.  Most likely, if he had, it would havebeen from Freda or some other woman.  There was Dartworthy, the collegeman who had staked the rich fraction on Bonanza above Discovery.Everybody knew that old Doolittle's daughter, Bertha, was madly in lovewith him.  Yet, when he contracted the disease, of all women, it hadbeen with the wife of Colonel Walthstone, the great Guggenhammer miningexpert. Result, three lunacy cases: Dartworthy selling out his mine forone-tenth its value; the poor woman sacrificing her respectability andsheltered nook in society to flee with him in an open boat down theYukon; and Colonel Walthstone, breathing murder and destruction, takingout after them in another open boat.  The whole impending tragedy hadmoved on down the muddy Yukon, passing Forty Mile and Circle and losingitself in the wilderness beyond.  But there it was, love, disorganizingmen's and women's lives, driving toward destruction and death, turningtopsy-turvy everything that was sensible and considerate, making bawdsor suicides out of virtuous women, and scoundrels and murderers out ofmen who had always been clean and square.For the first time in his life Daylight lost his nerve.  He was badlyand avowedly frightened.  Women were terrible creatures, and thelove-germ was especially plentiful in their neighborhood.And they were so reckless, so devoid of fear.  THEY were not frightenedby what had happened to the Virgin.  They held out their arms to himmore seductively than ever.  Even without his fortune, reckoned as amere man, just past thirty, magnificently strong and equallygood-looking and good-natured, he was a prize for most normal women.But when to his natural excellences were added the romance that linkedwith his name and the enormous wealth that was his, practically everyfree woman he encountered measured him with an appraising and delightedeye, to say nothing of more than one woman who was not free.  Other menmight have been spoiled by this and led to lose their heads; but theonly effect on him was to increase his fright.  As a result he refusedmost invitations to houses where women might be met, and frequentedbachelor boards and the Moosehorn Saloon, which had no dance-hallattached.CHAPTER XIIISix thousand spent the winter of 1897 in Dawson, work on the creekswent on apace, while beyond the passes it was reported that one hundredthousand more were waiting for the spring.  Late one brief afternoon,Daylight, on the benches between French Hill and Skookum Hill, caught awider vision of things.  Beneath him lay the richest part of EldoradoCreek, while up and down Bonanza he could see for miles.  It was ascene of a vast devastation. The hills, to their tops, had been shornof trees, and their naked sides showed signs of goring and perforatingthat even the mantle of snow could not hide.  Beneath him, in everydirection were the cabins of men.  But not many men were visible.  Ablanket of smoke filled the valleys and turned the gray day tomelancholy twilight.  Smoke arose from a thousand holes in the snow,where, deep down on bed-rock, in the frozen muck and gravel, men creptand scratched and dug, and ever built more fires to break the grip ofthe frost.  Here and there, where new shafts were starting, these firesflamed redly.  Figures of men crawled out of the holes, or disappearedinto them, or, on raised platforms of hand-hewn timber, windlassed thethawed gravel to the surface, where it immediately froze.  The wreckageof the spring washing appeared everywhere--piles of sluice-boxes,sections of elevated flumes, huge water-wheels,--all the debris of anarmy of gold-mad men."It-all's plain gophering," Daylight muttered aloud.He looked at the naked hills and realized the enormous wastage of woodthat had taken place.  From this bird's-eye view he realized themonstrous confusion of their excited workings.  It was a giganticinadequacy.  Each worked for himself, and the result was chaos.  Inthis richest of diggings it cost out by their feverish, unthinkingmethods another dollar was left hopelessly in the earth.  Given anotheryear, and most of the claims would be worked out, and the sum of thegold taken out would no more than equal what was left behind.Organization was what was needed, he decided; and his quick imaginationsketched Eldorado Creek, from mouth to source, and from mountain top tomountain top, in the hands of one capable management.  Evensteam-thawing, as yet untried, but bound to come, he saw would be amakeshift.  What should be done was to hydraulic the valley sides andbenches, and then, on the creek bottom, to use gold-dredges such as hehad heard described as operating in California.There was the very chance for another big killing.  He had wonderedjust what was precisely the reason for the Guggenhammers and the bigEnglish concerns sending in their high-salaried experts.  That wastheir scheme.  That was why they had approached him for the sale ofworked-out claims and tailings. They were content to let the smallmine-owners gopher out what they could, for there would be millions inthe leavings.And, gazing down on the smoky inferno of crude effort, Daylightoutlined the new game he would play, a game in which the Guggenhammersand the rest would have to reckon with him.  Cut along with the delightin the new conception came a weariness. He was tired of the long Arcticyears, and he was curious about the Outside--the great world of whichhe had heard other men talk and of which he was as ignorant as a child.There were games out there to play.  It was a larger table, and therewas no reason why he with his millions should not sit in and take ahand.  So it was, that afternoon on Skookum Hill, that he resolved toplay this last best Klondike hand and pull for the Outside.It took time, however.  He put trusted agents to work on the heels ofgreat experts, and on the creeks where they began to buy he likewisebought.  Wherever they tried to corner a worked-out creek, they foundhim standing in the way, owning blocks of claims or artfully scatteredclaims that put all their plans to naught."I play you-all wide open to win--am I right" he told them once, in aheated conference.Followed wars, truces, compromises, victories, and defeats.  By 1898,sixty thousand men were on the Klondike and all their fortunes andaffairs rocked back and forth and were affected by the battles Daylightfought.  And more and more the taste for the larger game urged inDaylight's mouth.  Here he was already locked in grapples with thegreat Guggenhammers, and winning, fiercely winning.  Possibly theseverest struggle was waged on Ophir, the veriest of moose-pastures,whose low-grade dirt was valuable only because of its vastness.  Theownership of a block of seven claims in the heart of it gave Daylighthis grip and they could not come to terms.  The Guggenhammer expertsconcluded that it was too big for him to handle, and when they gave himan ultimatum to that effect he accepted and bought them out.The plan was his own, but he sent down to the States for competentengineers to carry it out.  In the Rinkabilly watershed, eighty milesaway, he built his reservoir, and for eighty miles the huge woodenconduit carried the water across country to Ophir.  Estimated at threemillions, the reservoir and conduit cost nearer four.  Nor did he stopwith this.  Electric power plants were installed, and his workings werelighted as well as run by electricity.  Other sourdoughs, who hadstruck it rich in excess of all their dreams, shook their headsgloomily, warned him that he would go broke, and declined to invest inso extravagant a venture.But Daylight smiled, and sold out the remainder of his town-siteholdings.  He sold at the right time, at the height of the placer boom.When he prophesied to his old cronies, in the Moosehorn Saloon, thatwithin five years town lots in Dawson could not be given away, whilethe cabins would be chopped up for firewood, he was laughed at roundly,and assured that the mother-lode would be found ere that time.  But hewent ahead, when his need for lumber was finished, selling out hissawmills as well.  Likewise, he began to get rid of his scatteredholdings on the various creeks, and without thanks to any one hefinished his conduit, built his dredges, imported his machinery, andmade the gold of Ophir immediately accessible.  And he, who five yearsbefore had crossed over the divide from Indian River and threaded thesilent wilderness, his dogs packing Indian fashion, himself livingIndian fashion on straight moose meat, now heard the hoarse whistlescalling his hundreds of laborers to work, and watched them toil underthe white glare of the arc-lamps.But having done the thing, he was ready to depart.  And when he let theword go out, the Guggenhammers vied with the English concerns and witha new French company in bidding for Ophir and all its plant.  TheGuggenhammers bid highest, and the price they paid netted Daylight aclean million.  It was current rumor that he was worth anywhere fromtwenty to thirty millions.  But he alone knew just how he stood, andthat, with his last claim sold and the table swept clean of hiswinnings, he had ridden his hunch to the tune of just a trifle overeleven millions.His departure was a thing that passed into the history of the Yukonalong with his other deeds.  All the Yukon was his guest, Dawson theseat of the festivity.  On that one last night no man's dust save hisown was good.  Drinks were not to be purchased.  Every saloon ran open,with extra relays of exhausted bartenders, and the drinks were givenaway.  A man who refused this hospitality, and persisted in paying,found a dozen fights on his hands.  The veriest chechaquos rose up todefend the name of Daylight from such insult.  And through it all, onmoccasined feet, moved Daylight, hell-roaring Burning Daylight,over-spilling with good nature and camaraderie, howling his he-wolfhowl and claiming the night as his, bending men's arms down on thebars, performing feats of strength, his bronzed face flushed withdrink, his black eyes flashing, clad in overalls and blanket coat, hisear-flaps dangling and his gauntleted mittens swinging from the cordacross the shoulders.  But this time it was neither an ante nor a stakethat he threw away, but a mere marker in the game that he who held somany markers would not miss.As a night, it eclipsed anything that Dawson had ever seen.  It wasDaylight's desire to make it memorable, and his attempt was a success.A goodly portion of Dawson got drunk that night.  The fall weather wason, and, though the freeze-up of the Yukon still delayed, thethermometer was down to twenty-five below zero and falling.  Wherefore,it was necessary to organize gangs of life-savers, who patrolled thestreets to pick up drunken men from where they fell in the snow andwhere an hour's sleep would be fatal.  Daylight, whose whim it was tomake them drunk by hundreds and by thousands, was the one who initiatedthis life saving.  He wanted Dawson to have its night, but, in hisdeeper processes never careless nor wanton, he saw to it that it was anight without accident.  And, like his olden nights, his ukase wentforth that there should be no quarrelling nor fighting, offenders to bedealt with by him personally.  Nor did he have to deal with any.Hundreds of devoted followers saw to it that the evilly disposed wererolled in the snow and hustled off to bed. In the great world, wheregreat captains of industry die, all wheels under their erstwhilemanagement are stopped for a minute.But in the Klondike, such was its hilarious sorrow at the departure ofits captain, that for twenty-four hours no wheels revolved.  Even greatOphir, with its thousand men on the pay-roll, closed down.  On the dayafter the night there were no men present or fit to go to work.Next morning, at break of day, Dawson said good-by.  The thousands thatlined the bank wore mittens and their ear-flaps pulled down and tied.It was thirty below zero, the rim-ice was thickening, and the Yukoncarried a run of mush-ice.  From the deck of the Seattle, Daylightwaved and called his farewells.  As the lines were cast off and thesteamer swung out into the current, those near him saw the moisturewell up in Daylight's eyes.  In a way, it was to him departure from hisnative land, this grim Arctic region which was practically the onlyland he had known.  He tore off his cap and waved it."Good-by, you-all!" he called.  "Good-by, you-all!"PART IICHAPTER IIn no blaze of glory did Burning Daylight descend upon San Francisco.Not only had he been forgotten, but the Klondike along with him.  Theworld was interested in other things, and the Alaskan adventure, likethe Spanish War, was an old story.  Many things had happened sincethen.  Exciting things were happening every day, and thesensation-space of newspapers was limited. The effect of being ignored,however, was an exhilaration.  Big man as he had been in the Arcticgame, it merely showed how much bigger was this new game, when a manworth eleven millions, and with a history such as his, passed unnoticed.He settled down in St. Francis Hotel, was interviewed by thecub-reporters on the hotel-run, and received brief paragraphs of noticefor twenty-four hours.  He grinned to himself, and began to look aroundand get acquainted with the new order of beings and things.  He wasvery awkward and very self-possessed.  In addition to the stiffeningafforded his backbone by the conscious ownership of eleven millions, hepossessed an enormous certitude.Nothing abashed him, nor was he appalled by the display and culture andpower around him.  It was another kind of wilderness, that was all; andit was for him to learn the ways of it, the signs and trails andwater-holes where good hunting lay, and the bad stretches of field andflood to be avoided.  As usual, he fought shy of the women.  He wasstill too badly scared to come to close quarters with the dazzling andresplendent creatures his own millions made accessible.They looked and longed, but he so concealed his timidity that he hadall the seeming of moving boldly among them.  Nor was it his wealthalone that attracted them.  He was too much a man, and too much anunusual type of man.  Young yet, barely thirty-six, eminently handsome,magnificently strong, almost bursting with a splendid virility, hisfree trail-stride, never learned on pavements, and his black eyes,hinting of great spaces and unwearied with the close perspective of thecity dwellers, drew many a curious and wayward feminine glance.  Hesaw, grinned knowingly to himself, and faced them as so many dangers,with a cool demeanor that was a far greater personal achievement thanhad they been famine, frost, or flood.He had come down to the States to play the man's game, not the woman'sgame; and the men he had not yet learned.  They struck him assoft--soft physically; yet he divined them hard in their dealings, buthard under an exterior of supple softness.  It struck him that therewas something cat-like about them.  He met them in the clubs, andwondered how real was the good-fellowship they displayed and howquickly they would unsheathe their claws and gouge and rend.  "That'sthe proposition," he repeated to himself; "what will they-all do whenthe play is close and down to brass tacks?"  He felt unwarrantablysuspicious of them. "They're sure slick," was his secret judgment; andfrom bits of gossip dropped now and again he felt his judgment wellbuttressed.  On the other hand, they radiated an atmosphere ofmanliness and the fair play that goes with manliness.  They might gougeand rend in a fight--which was no more than natural; but he felt,somehow, that they would gouge and rend according to rule. This was theimpression he got of them--a generalization tempered by knowledge thatthere was bound to be a certain percentage of scoundrels among them.Several months passed in San Francisco during which time he studied thegame and its rules, and prepared himself to take a hand.  He even tookprivate instruction in English, and succeeded in eliminating his worstfaults, though in moments of excitement he was prone to lapse into"you-all," "knowed," "sure," and similar solecisms.  He learned to eatand dress and generally comport himself after the manner of civilizedman; but through it all he remained himself, not unduly reverential norconsiderative, and never hesitating to stride rough-shod over anysoft-faced convention if it got in his way and the provocation weregreat enough.  Also, and unlike the average run of weaker men comingfrom back countries and far places, he failed to reverence theparticular tin gods worshipped variously by the civilized tribes ofmen.  He had seen totems before, and knew them for what they were.Tiring of being merely an onlooker, he ran up to Nevada, where the newgold-mining boom was fairly started--"just to try a flutter," as hephrased it to himself.  The flutter on the Tonopah Stock Exchangelasted just ten days, during which time his smashing, wild-bull gameplayed ducks and drakes with the more stereotyped gamblers, and at theend of which time, having gambled Floridel into his fist, he let go fora net profit of half a million.  Whereupon, smacking his lips, hedeparted for San Francisco and the St. Francis Hotel.  It tasted good,and his hunger for the game became more acute.And once more the papers sensationalized him.  BURNING DAYLIGHT was abig-letter headline again.  Interviewers flocked about him.Old files of magazines and newspapers were searched through, and theromantic and historic Elam Harnish, Adventurer of the Frost, King ofthe Klondike, and father of the Sourdoughs, strode upon the breakfasttable of a million homes along with the toast and breakfast foods.Even before his elected time, he was forcibly launched into the game.Financiers and promoters, and all the flotsam and jetsam of the sea ofspeculation surged upon the shores of his eleven millions.  Inself-defence he was compelled to open offices.  He had made them sit upand take notice, and now, willy-nilly, they were dealing him hands andclamoring for him to play.  Well, play he would; he'd show 'em; evendespite the elated prophesies made of how swiftly he would betrimmed--prophesies coupled with descriptions of the bucolic game hewould play and of his wild and woolly appearance.He dabbled in little things at first--"stalling for time," as heexplained it to Holdsworthy, a friend he had made at the Alta-PacificClub.  Daylight himself was a member of the club, and Holdsworthy hadproposed him.  And it was well that Daylight played closely at first,for he was astounded by the multitudes of sharks--"ground-sharks," hecalled them--that flocked about him.He saw through their schemes readily enough, and even marveled thatsuch numbers of them could find sufficient prey to keep them going.Their rascality and general dubiousness was so transparent that hecould not understand how any one could be taken in by them.And then he found that there were sharks and sharks.  Holdsworthytreated him more like a brother than a mere fellow-clubman, watchingover him, advising him, and introducing him to the magnates of thelocal financial world.  Holdsworthy's family lived in a delightfulbungalow near Menlo Park, and here Daylight spent a number of weekends,seeing a fineness and kindness of home life of which he had neverdreamed.  Holdsworthy was an enthusiast over flowers, and a halflunatic over raising prize poultry; and these engrossing madnesses werea source of perpetual joy to Daylight, who looked on in tolerant goodhumor. Such amiable weaknesses tokened the healthfulness of the man,and drew Daylight closer to him.  A prosperous, successful business manwithout great ambition, was Daylight's estimate of him--a man tooeasily satisfied with the small stakes of the game ever to launch outin big play.On one such week-end visit, Holdsworthy let him in on a good thing, agood little thing, a brickyard at Glen Ellen.  Daylight listenedclosely to the other's description of the situation.  It was a mostreasonable venture, and Daylight's one objection was that it was sosmall a matter and so far out of his line; and he went into it only asa matter of friendship, Holdsworthy explaining that he was himselfalready in a bit, and that while it was a good thing, he would becompelled to make sacrifices in other directions in order to developit.  Daylight advanced the capital, fifty thousand dollars, and, as helaughingly explained afterward, "I was stung, all right, but it wasn'tHoldsworthy that did it half as much as those blamed chickens andfruit-trees of his."It was a good lesson, however, for he learned that there were fewfaiths in the business world, and that even the simple, homely faith ofbreaking bread and eating salt counted for little in the face of aworthless brickyard and fifty thousand dollars in cash.But the sharks and sharks of various orders and degrees, he concluded,were on the surface.  Deep down, he divined, were the integrities andthe stabilities.  These big captains of industry and masters offinance, he decided, were the men to work with. By the very nature oftheir huge deals and enterprises they had to play fair.  No room therefor little sharpers' tricks and bunco games.  It was to be expectedthat little men should salt gold-mines with a shotgun and work offworthless brick-yards on their friends, but in high finance suchmethods were not worth while.  There the men were engaged in developingthe country, organizing its railroads, opening up its mines, makingaccessible its vast natural resources.  Their play was bound to be bigand stable.  "They sure can't afford tin-horn tactics," was his summingup.So it was that he resolved to leave the little men, the Holdsworthys,alone; and, while he met them in good-fellowship, he chummed with none,and formed no deep friendships.  He did not dislike the little men, themen of the Alta-Pacific, for instance.  He merely did not elect tochoose them for partners in the big game in which he intended to play.What that big game was, even he did not know.  He was waiting to findit.  And in the meantime he played small hands, investing in severalarid-lands reclamation projects and keeping his eyes open for the bigchance when it should come along.And then he met John Dowsett, the great John Dowsett.  The whole thingwas fortuitous.  This cannot be doubted, as Daylight himself knew, itwas by the merest chance, when in Los Angeles, that he heard the tunawere running strong at Santa Catalina, and went over to the islandinstead of returning directly to San Francisco as he had planned.There he met John Dowsett, resting off for several days in the middleof a flying western trip. Dowsett had of course heard of thespectacular Klondike King and his rumored thirty millions, and hecertainly found himself interested by the man in the acquaintance thatwas formed. Somewhere along in this acquaintanceship the idea must havepopped into his brain.  But he did not broach it, preferring to matureit carefully.  So he talked in large general ways, and did his best tobe agreeable and win Daylight's friendship.It was the first big magnate Daylight had met face to face, and he waspleased and charmed.  There was such a kindly humanness about the man,such a genial democraticness, that Daylight found it hard to realizethat this was THE John Dowsett, president of a string of banks,insurance manipulator, reputed ally of the lieutenants of Standard Oil,and known ally of the Guggenhammers.Nor did his looks belie his reputation and his manner.Physically, he guaranteed all that Daylight knew of him.  Despite hissixty years and snow-white hair, his hand-shake was firmly hearty, andhe showed no signs of decrepitude, walking with a quick, snappy step,making all movements definitely and decisively.  His skin was a healthypink, and his thin, clean lips knew the way to writhe heartily over ajoke.  He had honest blue eyes of palest blue; they looked out at onekeenly and frankly from under shaggy gray brows.  His mind showeditself disciplined and orderly, and its workings struck Daylight ashaving all the certitude of a steel trap.  He was a man who KNEW andwho never decorated his knowledge with foolish frills of sentiment oremotion.  That he was accustomed to command was patent, and every wordand gesture tingled with power.  Combined with this was his sympathyand tact, and Daylight could note easily enough all the earmarks thatdistinguished him from a little man of the Holdsworthy caliber.Daylight knew also his history, the prime old American stock from whichhe had descended, his own war record, the John Dowsett before him whohad been one of the banking buttresses of the Cause of the Union, theCommodore Dowsett of the War of 1812 the General Dowsett ofRevolutionary fame, and that first far Dowsett, owner of lands andslaves in early New England."He's sure the real thing," he told one of his fellow-clubmenafterwards, in the smoking-room of the Alta-Pacific.  "I tell you,Gallon, he was a genuine surprise to me.  I knew the big ones had to belike that, but I had to see him to really know it. He's one of thefellows that does things.  You can see it sticking out all over him.He's one in a thousand, that's straight, a man to tie to.  There's nolimit to any game he plays, and you can stack on it that he plays rightup to the handle.  I bet he can lose or win half a dozen millionwithout batting an eye."Gallon puffed at his cigar, and at the conclusion of the panegyricregarded the other curiously; but Daylight, ordering cocktails, failedto note this curious stare."Going in with him on some deal, I suppose," Gallon remarked."Nope, not the slightest idea.  Here's kindness.  I was just explainingthat I'd come to understand how these big fellows do big things.  Why,d'ye know, he gave me such a feeling that he knew everything, that Iwas plumb ashamed of myself.""I guess I could give him cards and spades when it comes to driving adog-team, though," Daylight observed, after a meditative pause.  "And Ireally believe I could put him on to a few wrinkles in poker and placermining, and maybe in paddling a birch canoe.  And maybe I stand abetter chance to learn the game he's been playing all his life than hewould stand of learning the game I played up North."CHAPTER IIIt was not long afterward that Daylight came on to New York.  A letterfrom John Dowsett had been the cause--a simple little typewrittenletter of several lines.  But Daylight had thrilled as he read it.  Heremembered the thrill that was his, a callow youth of fifteen, when, inTempas Butte, through lack of a fourth man, Tom Galsworthy, thegambler, had said, "Get in, Kid; take a hand."  That thrill was hisnow.  The bald, typewritten sentences seemed gorged with mystery.  "OurMr. Howison will call upon you at your hotel.  He is to be trusted.  Wemust not be seen together.  You will understand after we have had ourtalk."  Daylight conned the words over and over.  That was it. The biggame had arrived, and it looked as if he were being invited to sit inand take a hand.  Surely, for no other reason would one man soperemptorily invite another man to make a journey across the continent.They met--thanks to "our" Mr. Howison,--up the Hudson, in a magnificentcountry home.  Daylight, according to instructions, arrived in aprivate motor-car which had been furnished him. Whose car it was he didnot know any more than did he know the owner of the house, with itsgenerous, rolling, tree-studded lawns.  Dowsett was already there, andanother man whom Daylight recognized before the introduction was begun.It was Nathaniel Letton, and none other.  Daylight had seen his face ascore of times in the magazines and newspapers, and read about hisstanding in the financial world and about his endowed University ofDaratona.  He, likewise, struck Daylight as a man of power, though hewas puzzled in that he could find no likeness to Dowsett.  Except inthe matter of cleanness,--a cleanness that seemed to go down to thedeepest fibers of him,--Nathaniel Letton was unlike the other in everyparticular.  Thin to emaciation, he seemed a cold flame of a man, a manof a mysterious, chemic sort of flame, who, under a glacier-likeexterior, conveyed, somehow, the impression of the ardent heat of athousand suns.  His large gray eyes were mainly responsible for thisfeeling, and they blazed out feverishly from what was almost adeath's-head, so thin was the face, the skin of which was a ghastly,dull, dead white.  Not more than fifty, thatched with a sparse growthof iron-gray hair, he looked several times the age of Dowsett.  YetNathaniel Letton possessed control--Daylight could see that plainly.He was a thin-faced ascetic, living in a state of high, attenuatedcalm--a molten planet under a transcontinental ice sheet.  And yet,above all most of all, Daylight was impressed by the terrific andalmost awful cleanness of the man.  There was no dross in him.  He hadall the seeming of having been purged by fire.  Daylight had thefeeling that a healthy man-oath would be a deadly offence to his ears,a sacrilege and a blasphemy.They drank--that is, Nathaniel Letton took mineral water served by thesmoothly operating machine of a lackey who inhabited the place, whileDowsett took Scotch and soda and Daylight a cocktail.  Nobody seemed tonotice the unusualness of a Martini at midnight, though Daylight lookedsharply for that very thing; for he had long since learned thatMartinis had their strictly appointed times and places.  But he likedMartinis, and, being a natural man, he chose deliberately to drink whenand how he pleased.  Others had noticed this peculiar habit of his, butnot so Dowsett and Letton; and Daylight's secret thought was: "Theysure wouldn't bat an eye if I called for a glass of corrosivesublimate."Leon Guggenhammer arrived in the midst of the drink, and orderedScotch.  Daylight studied him curiously.  This was one of the greatGuggenhammer family; a younger one, but nevertheless one of the crowdwith which he had locked grapples in the North.  Nor did LeonGuggenhammer fail to mention cognizance of that old affair.  Hecomplimented Daylight on his prowess--"The echoes of Ophir came down tous, you know.  And I must say, Mr. Daylight--er, Mr. Harnish, that youwhipped us roundly in that affair."Echoes!  Daylight could not escape the shock of the phrase--echoes hadcome down to them of the fight into which he had flung all his strengthand the strength of his Klondike millions.  The Guggenhammers sure mustgo some when a fight of that dimension was no more than a skirmish ofwhich they deigned to hear echoes."They sure play an almighty big game down here," was his conclusion,accompanied by a corresponding elation that it was just precisely thatalmighty big game in which he was about to be invited to play a hand.For the moment he poignantly regretted that rumor was not true, andthat his eleven millions were not in reality thirty millions.  Well,that much he would be frank about; he would let them know exactly howmany stacks of chips he could buy.Leon Guggenhammer was young and fat.  Not a day more than thirty, hisface, save for the adumbrated puff sacks under the eyes, was as smoothand lineless as a boy's.  He, too, gave the impression of cleanness.He showed in the pink of health; his unblemished, smooth-shaven skinshouted advertisement of his splendid physical condition.  In the faceof that perfect skin, his very fatness and mature, rotund paunch couldbe nothing other than normal.  He was constituted to be prone tofatness, that was all.The talk soon centred down to business, though Guggenhammer had firstto say his say about the forthcoming international yacht race and abouthis own palatial steam yacht, the Electra, whose recent engines werealready antiquated.  Dowsett broached the plan, aided by an occasionalremark from the other two, while Daylight asked questions.  Whateverthe proposition was, he was going into it with his eyes open.  And theyfilled his eyes with the practical vision of what they had in mind."They will never dream you are with us," Guggenhammer interjected, asthe outlining of the matter drew to a close, his handsome Jewish eyesflashing enthusiastically.  "They'll think you are raiding on your ownin proper buccaneer style.""Of course, you understand, Mr. Harnish, the absolute need for keepingour alliance in the dark," Nathaniel Letton warned gravely.Daylight nodded his head.  "And you also understand," Letton went on,"that the result can only be productive of good.  The thing islegitimate and right, and the only ones who may be hurt are the stockgamblers themselves.  It is not an attempt to smash the market.  As yousee yourself, you are to bull the market.  The honest investor will bethe gainer.""Yes, that's the very thing," Dowsett said.  "The commercial need forcopper is continually increasing.  Ward Valley Copper, and all that itstands for,--practically one-quarter of the world's supply, as I haveshown you,--is a big thing, how big, even we can scarcely estimate.Our arrangements are made.  We have plenty of capital ourselves, andyet we want more.  Also, there is too much Ward Valley out to suit ourpresent plans.  Thus we kill both birds with one stone--""And I am the stone," Daylight broke in with a smile."Yes, just that.  Not only will you bull Ward Valley, but you will atthe same time gather Ward Valley in.  This will be of inestimableadvantage to us, while you and all of us will profit by it as well.And as Mr. Letton has pointed out, the thing is legitimate and square.On the eighteenth the directors meet, and, instead of the customarydividend, a double dividend will be declared.""And where will the shorts be then?" Leon Guggenhammer cried excitedly."The shorts will be the speculators," Nathaniel Letton explained, "thegamblers, the froth of Wall Street--you understand.  The genuineinvestors will not be hurt.  Furthermore, they will have learned forthe thousandth time to have confidence in Ward Valley.  And with theirconfidence we can carry through the large developments we have outlinedto you.""There will be all sorts of rumors on the street," Dowsett warnedDaylight, "but do not let them frighten you.  These rumors may evenoriginate with us.  You can see how and why clearly.  But rumors are tobe no concern of yours.  You are on the inside. All you have to do isbuy, buy, buy, and keep on buying to the last stroke, when thedirectors declare the double dividend. Ward Valley will jump so that itwon't be feasible to buy after that.""What we want," Letton took up the strain, pausing significantly to siphis mineral water, "what we want is to take large blocks of Ward Valleyoff the hands of the public.  We could do this easily enough bydepressing the market and frightening the holders.  And we could do itmore cheaply in such fashion.  But we are absolute masters of thesituation, and we are fair enough to buy Ward Valley on a risingmarket.  Not that we are philanthropists, but that we need theinvestors in our big development scheme.  Nor do we lose directly bythe transaction. The instant the action of the directors becomes known,Ward Valley will rush heavenward.  In addition, and outside thelegitimate field of the transaction, we will pinch the shorts for avery large sum.  But that is only incidental, you understand, and in away, unavoidable.  On the other hand, we shall not turn up our noses atthat phase of it.  The shorts shall be the veriest gamblers, of course,and they will get no more than they deserve.""And one other thing, Mr. Harnish," Guggenhammer said, "if you exceedyour available cash, or the amount you care to invest in the venture,don't fail immediately to call on us.  Remember, we are behind you.""Yes, we are behind you," Dowsett repeated.Nathaniel Letton nodded his head in affirmation."Now about that double dividend on the eighteenth--" John Dowsett drewa slip of paper from his note-book and adjusted his glasses."Let me show you the figures.  Here, you see..."And thereupon he entered into a long technical and historicalexplanation of the earnings and dividends of Ward Valley from the dayof its organization.The whole conference lasted not more than an hour, during which timeDaylight lived at the topmost of the highest peak of life that he hadever scaled.  These men were big players.  They were powers.  True, ashe knew himself, they were not the real inner circle.  They did notrank with the Morgans and Harrimans.  And yet they were in touch withthose giants and were themselves lesser giants.  He was pleased, too,with their attitude toward him.  They met him deferentially, but notpatronizingly.  It was the deference of equality, and Daylight couldnot escape the subtle flattery of it; for he was fully aware that inexperience as well as wealth they were far and away beyond him."We'll shake up the speculating crowd," Leon Guggenhammer proclaimedjubilantly, as they rose to go.  "And you are the man to do it, Mr.Harnish.  They are bound to think you are on your own, and their shearsare all sharpened for the trimming of newcomers like you.""They will certainly be misled," Letton agreed, his eerie gray eyesblazing out from the voluminous folds of the huge Mueller with which hewas swathing his neck to the ears.  "Their minds run in ruts.  It isthe unexpected that upsets their stereotyped calculations--any newcombination, any strange factor, any fresh variant.  And you will beall that to them, Mr. Harnish.  And I repeat, they are gamblers, andthey will deserve all that befalls them.  They clog and cumber alllegitimate enterprise.  You have no idea of the trouble they cause menlike us--sometimes, by their gambling tactics, upsetting the soundestplans, even overturning the stablest institutions."Dowsett and young Guggenhammer went away in one motor-car, and Lettonby himself in another.  Daylight, with still in the forefront of hisconsciousness all that had occurred in the preceding hour, was deeplyimpressed by the scene at the moment of departure.  The three machinesstood like weird night monsters at the gravelled foot of the widestairway under the unlighted porte-cochere.  It was a dark night, andthe lights of the motor-cars cut as sharply through the blackness asknives would cut through solid substance.  The obsequious lackey--theautomatic genie of the house which belonged to none of the threemen,--stood like a graven statue after having helped them in. Thefur-coated chauffeurs bulked dimly in their seats.  One after theother, like spurred steeds, the cars leaped into the blackness, tookthe curve of the driveway, and were gone.Daylight's car was the last, and, peering out, he caught a glimpse ofthe unlighted house that loomed hugely through the darkness like amountain.  Whose was it?  he wondered.  How came they to use it fortheir secret conference?  Would the lackey talk?  How about thechauffeurs?  Were they trusted men like "our" Mr. Howison?  Mystery?The affair was alive with it.  And hand in hand with mystery walkedPower.  He leaned back and inhaled his cigarette.  Big things wereafoot.  The cards were shuffled even then for a mighty deal, and he wasin on it.  He remembered back to his poker games with Jack Kearns, andlaughed aloud.  He had played for thousands in those days on the turnof a card; but now he was playing for millions.  And on the eighteenth,when that dividend was declared, he chuckled at the confusion thatwould inevitably descend upon the men with the sharpened shears waitingto trim him--him, Burning Daylight.CHAPTER IIIBack at his hotel, though nearly two in the morning, he found thereporters waiting to interview him.  Next morning there were more.  Andthus, with blare of paper trumpet, was he received by New York.  Oncemore, with beating of toms-toms and wild hullaballoo, his picturesquefigure strode across the printed sheet.  The King of the Klondike, thehero of the Arctic, the thirty-million-dollar millionaire of the North,had come to New York.  What had he come for?  To trim the New Yorkersas he had trimmed the Tonopah crowd in Nevada?  Wall Street had bestwatch out, for the wild man of Klondike had just come to town.  Or,perchance, would Wall Street trim him?  Wall Street had trimmed manywild men; would this be Burning Daylight's fate?  Daylight grinned tohimself, and gave out ambiguous interviews.  It helped the game, and hegrinned again, as he meditated that Wall Street would sure have to gosome before it trimmed him.They were prepared for him to play, and, when heavy buying of WardValley began, it was quickly decided that he was the operator.Financial gossip buzzed and hummed.  He was after the Guggenhammersonce more.  The story of Ophir was told over again and sensationalizeduntil even Daylight scarcely recognized it. Still, it was all grist tohis mill.  The stock gamblers were clearly befooled.  Each day heincreased his buying, and so eager were the sellers that Ward Valleyrose but slowly.  "It sure beats poker," Daylight whispered gleefullyto himself, as he noted the perturbation he was causing.  Thenewspapers hazarded countless guesses and surmises, and Daylight wasconstantly dogged by a small battalion of reporters.  His owninterviews were gems.  Discovering the delight the newspapers took inhis vernacular, in his "you-alls," and "sures," and "surge-ups," heeven exaggerated these particularities of speech, exploiting thephrases he had heard other frontiersmen use, and inventing occasionallya new one of his own.A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday theeighteenth.  Not only was he gambling as he had never gambled before,but he was gambling at the biggest table in the world and for stakes solarge that even the case-hardened habitues of that table were compelledto sit up.  In spite of the unlimited selling, his persistent buyingcompelled Ward Valley steadily to rise, and as Thursday approached, thesituation became acute. Something had to smash.  How much Ward Valleywas this Klondike gambler going to buy?  How much could he buy?  Whatwas the Ward Valley crowd doing all this time?  Daylight appreciatedthe interviews with them that appeared--interviews delightfully placidand non-committal.  Leon Guggenhammer even hazarded the opinion thatthis Northland Croesus might possibly be making a mistake. But not thatthey cared, John Dowsett explained.  Nor did they object.  While in thedark regarding his intentions, of one thing they were certain; namely,that he was bulling Ward Valley.  And they did not mind that.  Nomatter what happened to him and his spectacular operations, Ward Valleywas all right, and would remain all right, as firm as the Rock ofGibraltar.  No; they had no Ward Valley to sell, thank you.  Thispurely fictitious state of the market was bound shortly to pass, andWard Valley was not to be induced to change the even tenor of its wayby any insane stock exchange flurry.  "It is purely gambling frombeginning to end," were Nathaniel Letton's words; "and we refuse tohave anything to do with it or to take notice of it in any way."During this time Daylight had several secret meetings with hispartners--one with Leon Guggenhammer, one with John Dowsett, and twowith Mr. Howison.  Beyond congratulations, they really amounted tonothing; for, as he was informed, everything was going satisfactorily.But on Tuesday morning a rumor that was disconcerting came toDaylight's ears.  It was also published in the Wall Street Journal, andit was to the effect, on apparently straight inside information, thaton Thursday, when the directors of Ward Valley met, instead of thecustomary dividend being declared, an assessment would be levied.  Itwas the first check Daylight had received.  It came to him with a shockthat if the thing were so he was a broken man.  And it also came to himthat all this colossal operating of his was being done on his ownmoney. Dowsett, Guggenhammer, and Letton were risking nothing.  It wasa panic, short-lived, it was true, but sharp enough while it lasted tomake him remember Holdsworthy and the brick-yard, and to impel him tocancel all buying orders while he rushed to a telephone."Nothing in it--only a rumor," came Leon Guggenhammer's throaty voicein the receiver.  "As you know," said Nathaniel Letton, "I am one ofthe directors, and I should certainly be aware of it were such actioncontemplated."  And John Dowsett: "I warned you against just suchrumors.  There is not an iota of truth in it--certainly not.  I tellyou on my honor as a gentleman."Heartily ashamed of himself for his temporary loss of nerve, Daylightreturned to his task.  The cessation of buying had turned the StockExchange into a bedlam, and down all the line of stocks the bears weresmashing.  Ward Valley, as the ape, received the brunt of the shock,and was already beginning to tumble.  Daylight calmly doubled hisbuying orders.  And all through Tuesday and Wednesday, and Thursdaymorning, he went on buying, while Ward Valley rose triumphantly higher.Still they sold, and still he bought, exceeding his power to buy manytimes over, when delivery was taken into account.  What of that?  Onthis day the double dividend would be declared, he assured himself.The pinch of delivery would be on the shorts.  They would be makingterms with him.And then the thunderbolt struck.  True to the rumor, Ward Valley leviedthe assessment.  Daylight threw up his arms.  He verified the reportand quit.  Not alone Ward Valley, but all securities were beinghammered down by the triumphant bears.  As for Ward Valley, Daylightdid not even trouble to learn if it had fetched bottom or was stilltumbling.  Not stunned, not even bewildered, while Wall Street wentmad, Daylight withdrew from the field to think it over.  After a shortconference with his brokers, he proceeded to his hotel, on the waypicking up the evening papers and glancing at the head-lines.  BURNINGDAYLIGHT CLEANED OUT, he read; DAYLIGHT GETS HIS; ANOTHER WESTERNERFAILS TO FIND EASY MONEY.  As he entered his hotel, a later editionannounced the suicide of a young man, a lamb, who had followedDaylight's play.What in hell did he want to kill himself for?  was Daylight's mutteredcomment.He passed up to his rooms, ordered a Martini cocktail, took off hisshoes, and sat down to think.  After half an hour he roused himself totake the drink, and as he felt the liquor pass warmingly through hisbody, his features relaxed into a slow, deliberate, yet genuine grin.He was laughing at himself."Buncoed, by gosh!" he muttered.Then the grin died away, and his face grew bleak and serious. Leavingout his interests in the several Western reclamation projects (whichwere still assessing heavily), he was a ruined man.  But harder hitthan this was his pride.  He had been so easy.  They had gold-brickedhim, and he had nothing to show for it.  The simplest farmer would havehad documents, while he had nothing but a gentleman's agreement, and averbal one at that. Gentleman's agreement.  He snorted over it.  JohnDowsett's voice, just as he had heard it in the telephone receiver,sounded in his ears the words, "On my honor as a gentleman."  They weresneak-thieves and swindlers, that was what they were, and they hadgiven him the double-cross.  The newspapers were right.  He had come toNew York to be trimmed, and Messrs. Dowsett, Letton, and Guggenhammerhad done it.  He was a little fish, and they had played with him tendays--ample time in which to swallow him, along with his elevenmillions.  Of course, they had been unloading on him all the time, andnow they were buying Ward Valley back for a song ere the market righteditself.  Most probably, out of his share of the swag, Nathaniel Lettonwould erect a couple of new buildings for that university of his.  LeonGuggenhammer would buy new engines for that yacht, or a whole fleet ofyachts.  But what the devil Dowsett would do with his whack, was beyondhim--most likely start another string of banks.And Daylight sat and consumed cocktails and saw back in his life toAlaska, and lived over the grim years in which he had battled for hiseleven millions.  For a while murder ate at his heart, and wild ideasand sketchy plans of killing his betrayers flashed through his mind.That was what that young man should have done instead of killinghimself.  He should have gone gunning. Daylight unlocked his grip andtook out his automatic pistol--a big Colt's .44.  He released thesafety catch with his thumb, and operating the sliding outer barrel,ran the contents of the clip through the mechanism.  The eightcartridges slid out in a stream.  He refilled the clip, threw acartridge into the chamber, and, with the trigger at full cock, thrustup the safety ratchet.  He shoved the weapon into the side pocket ofhis coat, ordered another Martini, and resumed his seat.He thought steadily for an hour, but he grinned no more.  Lines formedin his face, and in those lines were the travail of the North, the biteof the frost, all that he had achieved and suffered--the long, unendingweeks of trail, the bleak tundra shore of Point Barrow, the smashingice-jam of the Yukon, the battles with animals and men, thelean-dragged days of famine, the long months of stinging hell among themosquitoes of the Koyokuk, the toil of pick and shovel, the scars andmars of pack-strap and tump-line, the straight meat diet with the dogs,and all the long procession of twenty full years of toil and sweat andendeavor.At ten o'clock he arose and pored over the city directory.  Then he puton his shoes, took a cab, and departed into the night. Twice he changedcabs, and finally fetched up at the night office of a detective agency.He superintended the thing himself, laid down money in advance inprofuse quantities, selected the six men he needed, and gave them theirinstructions.  Never, for so simple a task, had they been so well paid;for, to each, in addition to office charges, he gave afive-hundred-dollar bill, with the promise of another if he succeeded.Some time next day, he was convinced, if not sooner, his three silentpartners would come together.  To each one two of his detectives wereto be attached.  Time and place was all he wanted to learn."Stop at nothing, boys," were his final instructions.  "I must havethis information.  Whatever you do, whatever happens, I'll sure see youthrough."Returning to his hotel, he changed cabs as before, went up to his room,and with one more cocktail for a nightcap, went to bed and to sleep.In the morning he dressed and shaved, ordered breakfast and thenewspapers sent up, and waited.  But he did not drink.  By nine o'clockhis telephone began to ring and the reports to come in.  NathanielLetton was taking the train at Tarrytown.  John Dowsett was coming downby the subway.  Leon Guggenhammer had not stirred out yet, though hewas assuredly within.  And in this fashion, with a map of the cityspread out before him, Daylight followed the movements of his three menas they drew together.  Nathaniel Letton was at his offices in theMutual-Solander Building.  Next arrived Guggenhammer.  Dowsett wasstill in his own offices.  But at eleven came the word that he also hadarrived, and several minutes later Daylight was in a hired motor-carand speeding for the Mutual-Solander Building.CHAPTER IVNathaniel Letton was talking when the door opened; he ceased, and withhis two companions gazed with controlled perturbation at BurningDaylight striding into the room.  The free, swinging movements of thetrail-traveler were unconsciously exaggerated in that stride of his.In truth, it seemed to him that he felt the trail beneath his feet."Howdy, gentlemen, howdy," he remarked, ignoring the unnatural calmwith which they greeted his entrance.  He shook hands with them inturn, striding from one to another and gripping their hands so heartilythat Nathaniel Letton could not forbear to wince.  Daylight flunghimself into a massive chair and sprawled lazily, with an appearance offatigue.  The leather grip he had brought into the room he droppedcarelessly beside him on the floor."Goddle mighty, but I've sure been going some," he sighed.  "We suretrimmed them beautiful.  It was real slick.  And the beauty of the playnever dawned on me till the very end.  It was pure and simple knockdown and drag out.  And the way they fell for it was amazin'."The geniality in his lazy Western drawl reassured them.  He was not soformidable, after all.  Despite the act that he had effected anentrance in the face of Letton's instructions to the outer office, heshowed no indication of making a scene or playing rough."Well," Daylight demanded good-humoredly, "ain't you-all got a goodword for your pardner?  Or has his sure enough brilliance plumb dazzledyou-all?"Letton made a dry sound in his throat.  Dowsett sat quietly and waited,while Leon Guggenhammer struggled into articulation."You have certainly raised Cain," he said.Daylight's black eyes flashed in a pleased way."Didn't I, though!" he proclaimed jubilantly.  "And didn't we fool'em!I was totally surprised.  I never dreamed they would be that easy."And now," he went on, not permitting the pause to grow awkward,"we-all might as well have an accounting.  I'm pullin' West thisafternoon on that blamed Twentieth Century."  He tugged at his grip,got it open, and dipped into it with both his hands.  "But don'tforget, boys, when you-all want me to hornswoggle Wall Street anotherflutter, all you-all have to do is whisper the word.  I'll sure beright there with the goods."His hands emerged, clutching a great mass of stubs, check-books, andbroker's receipts.  These he deposited in a heap on the big table, anddipping again, he fished out the stragglers and added them to the pile.He consulted a slip of paper, drawn from his coat pocket, and readaloud:--"Ten million twenty-seven thousand and forty-two dollars andsixty-eight cents is my figurin' on my expenses.  Of course that-all'staken from the winnings before we-all get to figurin' on the whack-up.Where's your figures?  It must a' been a Goddle mighty big clean-up."The three men looked their bepuzzlement at one another.  The man was abigger fool than they had imagined, or else he was playing a game whichthey could not divine.Nathaniel Letton moistened his lips and spoke up."It will take some hours yet, Mr. Harnish, before the full accountingcan be made.  Mr. Howison is at work upon it now. We--ah--as you say,it has been a gratifying clean-up.  Suppose we have lunch together andtalk it over.  I'll have the clerks work through the noon hour, so thatyou will have ample time to catch your train."Dowsett and Guggenhammer manifested a relief that was almost obvious.The situation was clearing.  It was disconcerting, under thecircumstances, to be pent in the same room with this heavy-muscled,Indian-like man whom they had robbed.  They remembered unpleasantly themany stories of his strength and recklessness.  If Letton could onlyput him off long enough for them to escape into the policed worldoutside the office door, all would be well; and Daylight showed all thesigns of being put off."I'm real glad to hear that," he said.  "I don't want to miss thattrain, and you-all have done me proud, gentlemen, letting me in on thisdeal.  I just do appreciate it without being able to express myfeelings.  But I am sure almighty curious, and I'd like terrible toknow, Mr. Letton, what your figures of our winning is.  Can you-allgive me a rough estimate?"Nathaniel Letton did not look appealingly at his two friends, but inthe brief pause they felt that appeal pass out from him. Dowsett, ofsterner mould than the others, began to divine that the Klondiker wasplaying.  But the other two were still under the blandishment of hischild-like innocence."It is extremely--er--difficult," Leon Guggenhammer began.  "You see,Ward Valley has fluctuated so, er--""That no estimate can possibly be made in advance," Letton supplemented."Approximate it, approximate it," Daylight counselled cheerfully."It don't hurt if you-all are a million or so out one side or theother.  The figures'll straighten that up.  But I'm that curious I'mjust itching all over.  What d'ye say?""Why continue to play at cross purposes?" Dowsett demanded abruptly andcoldly.  "Let us have the explanation here and now. Mr. Harnish islaboring under a false impression, and he should be set straight.  Inthis deal--"But Daylight interrupted.  He had played too much poker to be unawareor unappreciative of the psychological factor, and he headed Dowsettoff in order to play the denouncement of the present game in his ownway."Speaking of deals," he said, "reminds me of a poker game I once seenin Reno, Nevada.  It wa'n't what you-all would call a square game.They-all was tin-horns that sat in.  But they was atenderfoot--short-horns they-all are called out there.  He standsbehind the dealer and sees that same dealer give hisself four acesoffen the bottom of the deck.  The tenderfoot is sure shocked.  Heslides around to the player facin' the dealer across the table."'Say,' he whispers, 'I seen the dealer deal hisself four aces.'"'Well, an' what of it?" says the player."'I'm tryin' to tell you-all because I thought you-all ought to know,'says the tenderfoot.  'I tell you-all I seen him deal hisself fouraces.'"'Say, mister,' says the player, 'you-all'd better get outa here.You-all don't understand the game.  It's his deal, ain't it?'"The laughter that greeted his story was hollow and perfunctory, butDaylight appeared not to notice it."Your story has some meaning, I suppose," Dowsett said pointedly.Daylight looked at him innocently and did not reply.  He turnedjovially to Nathaniel Letton."Fire away," he said.  "Give us an approximation of our winning. As Isaid before, a million out one way or the other won't matter, it'sbound to be such an almighty big winning."  By this time Letton wasstiffened by the attitude Dowsett had taken, and his answer was promptand definite."I fear you are under a misapprehension, Mr. Harnish.  There are nowinnings to be divided with you.  Now don't get excited, I beg of you.I have but to press this button..."Far from excited, Daylight had all the seeming of being stunned. Hefelt absently in his vest pocket for a match, lighted it, anddiscovered that he had no cigarette.  The three men watched him withthe tense closeness of cats.  Now that it had come, they knew that theyhad a nasty few minutes before them."Do you-all mind saying that over again?" Daylight said.  "Seems to meI ain't got it just exactly right.  You-all said...?"He hung with painful expectancy on Nathaniel Letton's utterance."I said you were under a misapprehension, Mr. Harnish, that was all.You have been stock gambling, and you have been hard hit. But neitherWard Valley, nor I, nor my associates, feel that we owe you anything."Daylight pointed at the heap of receipts and stubs on the table."That-all represents ten million twenty-seven thousand and forty-twodollars and sixty-eight cents, hard cash.  Ain't it good for anythinghere?"Letton smiled and shrugged his shoulders.Daylight looked at Dowsett and murmured:--"I guess that story of mine had some meaning, after all."  He laughedin a sickly fashion.  "It was your deal all right, and you-all dolethem right, too.  Well, I ain't kicking.  I'm like the player in thatpoker game.  It was your deal, and you-all had a right to do your best.And you done it--cleaned me out slicker'n a whistle."He gazed at the heap on the table with an air of stupefaction."And that-all ain't worth the paper it's written on. Gol dast it,you-all can sure deal 'em 'round when you get a chance. Oh, no, I ain'ta-kicking.  It was your deal, and you-all certainly done me, and a manain't half a man that squeals on another man's deal.  And now the handis played out, and the cards are on the table, and the deal's over,but..."His hand, dipping swiftly into his inside breast pocket, appeared withthe big Colt's automatic."As I was saying, the old deal's finished.  Now it's MY deal, and I'ma-going to see if I can hold them four aces--"Take your hand away, you whited sepulchre!" he cried sharply.Nathaniel Letton's hand, creeping toward the push-button on the desk,was abruptly arrested."Change chairs," Daylight commanded.  "Take that chair over there, yougangrene-livered skunk.  Jump! By God! or I'll make you leak tillfolks'll think your father was a water hydrant and your mother asprinkling-cart.  You-all move your chair alongside, Guggenhammer; andyou-all Dowsett, sit right there, while I just irrelevantly explain thevirtues of this here automatic.  She's loaded for big game and she goesoff eight times.  She's a sure hummer when she gets started."Preliminary remarks being over, I now proceed to deal. Remember, Iain't making no remarks about your deal.  You done your darndest, andit was all right.  But this is my deal, and it's up to me to do mydarndest.  In the first place, you-all know me.  I'm BurningDaylight--savvee?  Ain't afraid of God, devil, death, nor destruction.Them's my four aces, and they sure copper your bets.  Look at thatthere living skeleton. Letton, you're sure afraid to die.  Your bonesis all rattling together you're that scared.  And look at that fat Jewthere. This little weapon's sure put the fear of God in his heart.He's yellow as a sick persimmon.  Dowsett, you're a cool one.  You-allain't batted an eye nor turned a hair.  That's because you're great onarithmetic.  And that makes you-all dead easy in this deal of mine.You're sitting there and adding two and two together, and you-all knowI sure got you skinned.  You know me, and that I ain't afraid ofnothing.  And you-all adds up all your money and knows you ain'ta-going to die if you can help it.""I'll see you hanged," was Dowsett's retort."Not by a damned sight.  When the fun starts, you're the first I plug.I'll hang all right, but you-all won't live to see it. You-all die hereand now while I'll die subject to the law's delay--savvee?  Being dead,with grass growing out of your carcasses, you won't know when I hang,but I'll sure have the pleasure a long time of knowing you-all beat meto it."Daylight paused."You surely wouldn't kill us?" Letton asked in a queer, thin voice.Daylight shook his head."It's sure too expensive.  You-all ain't worth it.  I'd sooner have mychips back.  And I guess you-all'd sooner give my chips back than go tothe dead-house."A long silence followed."Well, I've done dealt.  It's up to you-all to play.  But while you'redeliberating, I want to give you-all a warning: if that door opens andany one of you cusses lets on there's anything unusual, right here andthen I sure start plugging.  They ain't a soul'll get out the roomexcept feet first."A long session of three hours followed.  The deciding factor was notthe big automatic pistol, but the certitude that Daylight would use it.Not alone were the three men convinced of this, but Daylight himselfwas convinced.  He was firmly resolved to kill the men if his money wasnot forthcoming.  It was not an easy matter, on the spur of the moment,to raise ten millions in paper currency, and there were vexatiousdelays.  A dozen times Mr. Howison and the head clerk were summonedinto the room.  On these occasions the pistol lay on Daylight's lap,covered carelessly by a newspaper, while he was usually engaged inrolling or lighting his brown-paper cigarettes.  But in the end, thething was accomplished.  A suit-case was brought up by one of theclerks from the waiting motor-car, and Daylight snapped it shut on thelast package of bills.  He paused at the door to make his final remarks."There's three several things I sure want to tell you-all.  When I getoutside this door, you-all'll be set free to act, and I just want towarn you-all about what to do.  In the first place, no warrants for myarrest--savvee?  This money's mine, and I ain't robbed you of it.  Ifit gets out how you gave me the double-cross and how I done you backagain, the laugh'll be on you, and it'll sure be an almighty big laugh.You-all can't afford that laugh. Besides, having got back my stake thatyou-all robbed me of, if you arrest me and try to rob me a second time,I'll go gunning for you-all, and I'll sure get you.  No littlefraid-cat shrimps like you-all can skin Burning Daylight.  If you winyou lose, and there'll sure be some several unexpected funerals aroundthis burg."Just look me in the eye, and you-all'll savvee I mean business. Themstubs and receipts on the table is all yourn.  Good day."As the door shut behind him, Nathaniel Letton sprang for the telephone,and Dowsett intercepted him."What are you going to do?" Dowsett demanded."The police.  It's downright robbery.  I won't stand it.  I tell you Iwon't stand it."Dowsett smiled grimly, but at the same time bore the slender financierback and down into his chair."We'll talk it over," he said; and in Leon Guggenhammer he found ananxious ally.And nothing ever came of it.  The thing remained a secret with thethree men.  Nor did Daylight ever give the secret away, though thatafternoon, leaning back in his stateroom on the Twentieth Century, hisshoes off, and feet on a chair, he chuckled long and heartily.  NewYork remained forever puzzled over the affair; nor could it hit upon arational explanation. By all rights, Burning Daylight should have gonebroke, yet it was known that he immediately reappeared in San Franciscopossessing an apparently unimpaired capital.  This was evidenced by themagnitude of the enterprises he engaged in, such as, for instance,Panama Mail, by sheer weight of money and fighting power wresting thecontrol away from Shiftily and selling out in two months to theHarriman interests at a rumored enormous advance.CHAPTER VBack in San Francisco, Daylight quickly added to his reputation In waysit was not an enviable reputation.  Men were afraid of him.  He becameknown as a fighter, a fiend, a tiger.  His play was a ripping andsmashing one, and no one knew where or how his next blow would fall.The element of surprise was large.  He balked on the unexpected, and,fresh from the wild North, his mind not operating in stereotypedchannels, he was able in unusual degree to devise new tricks andstratagems.  And once he won the advantage, he pressed itremorselessly.  "As relentless as a Red Indian," was said of him, andit was said truly.On the other hand, he was known as "square."  His word was as good ashis bond, and this despite the fact that he accepted nobody's word.  Healways shied at propositions based on gentlemen's agreements, and a manwho ventured his honor as a gentleman, in dealing with Daylight,inevitably was treated to an unpleasant time.  Daylight never gave hisown word unless he held the whip-hand.  It was a case with the otherfellow taking it or nothing.Legitimate investment had no place in Daylight's play.  It tied up hismoney, and reduced the element of risk.  It was the gambling side ofbusiness that fascinated him, and to play in his slashing mannerrequired that his money must be ready to hand. It was never tied upsave for short intervals, for he was principally engaged in turning itover and over, raiding here, there, and everywhere, a veritable pirateof the financial main. A five-per cent safe investment had noattraction for him; but to risk millions in sharp, harsh skirmish,standing to lose everything or to win fifty or a hundred per cent, wasthe savor of life to him.  He played according to the rules of thegame, but he played mercilessly.  When he got a man or a corporationdown and they squealed, he gouged no less hard.  Appeals for financialmercy fell on deaf ears.  He was a free lance, and had no friendlybusiness associations.  Such alliances as were formed from time to timewere purely affairs of expediency, and he regarded his allies as menwho would give him the double-cross or ruin him if a profitable chancepresented.  In spite of this point of view, he was faithful to hisallies.  But he was faithful just as long as they were and no longer.The treason had to come from them, and then it was 'Ware Daylight.The business men and financiers of the Pacific coast never forgot thelesson of Charles Klinkner and the California & Altamont Trust Company.Klinkner was the president.  In partnership with Daylight, the pairraided the San Jose Interurban.  The powerful Lake Power & ElectricLighting corporation came to the rescue, and Klinkner, seeing what hethought was the opportunity, went over to the enemy in the thick of thepitched battle.  Daylight lost three millions before he was done withit, and before he was done with it he saw the California & AltamontTrust Company hopelessly wrecked, and Charles Klinkner a suicide in afelon's cell.  Not only did Daylight lose his grip on San JoseInterurban, but in the crash of his battle front he lost heavily allalong the line.  It was conceded by those competent to judge that hecould have compromised and saved much.  But, instead, he deliberatelythrew up the battle with San Jose Interurban and Lake Power, and,apparently defeated, with Napoleonic suddenness struck at Klinkner.  Itwas the last unexpected thing Klinkner would have dreamed of, andDaylight knew it.  He knew, further, that the California & AltamontTrust Company has an intrinsically sound institution, but that justthen it was in a precarious condition due to Klinkner's speculationswith its money.  He knew, also, that in a few months the Trust Companywould be more firmly on its feet than ever, thanks to those samespeculations, and that if he were to strike he must strike immediately."It's just that much money in pocket and a whole lot more," he wasreported to have said in connection with his heavy losses.  "It's justso much insurance against the future.  Henceforth, men who go in withme on deals will think twice before they try to double-cross me, andthen some."The reason for his savageness was that he despised the men with whom heplayed.  He had a conviction that not one in a hundred of them wasintrinsically square; and as for the square ones, he prophesied that,playing in a crooked game, they were sure to lose and in the long rungo broke.  His New York experience had opened his eyes.  He tore theveils of illusion from the business game, and saw its nakedness.  Hegeneralized upon industry and society somewhat as follows:--Society, as organized, was a vast bunco game.  There were manyhereditary inefficients--men and women who were not weak enough to beconfined in feeble-minded homes, but who were not strong enough to beought else than hewers of wood and drawers of water.Then there were the fools who took the organized bunco game seriously,honoring and respecting it.  They were easy game for the others, whosaw clearly and knew the bunco game for what it was.Work, legitimate work, was the source of all wealth.  That was to say,whether it was a sack of potatoes, a grand piano, or a seven-passengertouring car, it came into being only by the performance of work.  Wherethe bunco came in was in the distribution of these things after laborhad created them.  He failed to see the horny-handed sons of toilenjoying grand pianos or riding in automobiles.  How this came aboutwas explained by the bunco.  By tens of thousands and hundreds ofthousands men sat up nights and schemed how they could get between theworkers and the things the workers produced.  These schemers were thebusiness men.  When they got between the worker and his product, theytook a whack out of it for themselves The size of the whack wasdetermined by no rule of equity; but by their own strength andswinishness.  It was always a case of "all the traffic can bear."  Hesaw all men in the business game doing this.One day, in a mellow mood (induced by a string of cocktails and ahearty lunch), he started a conversation with Jones, the elevator boy.Jones was a slender, mop-headed, man-grown, truculent flame of anindividual who seemed to go out of his way to insult his passengers.It was this that attracted Daylight's interest, and he was not long infinding out what was the matter with Jones.  He was a proletarian,according to his own aggressive classification, and he had wanted towrite for a living.  Failing to win with the magazines, and compelledto find himself in food and shelter, he had gone to the little valleyof Petacha, not a hundred miles from Los Angeles.  Here, toiling in theday-time, he planned to write and study at night.  But the railroadcharged all the traffic would bear.  Petacha was a desert valley, andproduced only three things: cattle, fire-wood, and charcoal.  Forfreight to Los Angeles on a carload of cattle the railroad chargedeight dollars.  This, Jones explained, was due to the fact that thecattle had legs and could be driven to Los Angeles at a cost equivalentto the charge per car load.  But firewood had no legs, and the railroadcharged just precisely twenty-four dollars a carload.This was a fine adjustment, for by working hammer-and-tongs through atwelve-hour day, after freight had been deducted from the selling priceof the wood in Los Angeles, the wood-chopper received one dollar andsixty cents.  Jones had thought to get ahead of the game by turning hiswood into charcoal.  His estimates were satisfactory.  But the railroadalso made estimates.  It issued a rate of forty-two dollars a car oncharcoal.  At the end of three months, Jones went over his figures, andfound that he was still making one dollar and sixty cents a day."So I quit," Jones concluded.  "I went hobbling for a year, and I gotback at the railroads.  Leaving out the little things, I came acrossthe Sierras in the summer and touched a match to the snow-sheds.  Theyonly had a little thirty-thousand-dollar fire. I guess that squared upall balances due on Petacha.""Son, ain't you afraid to be turning loose such information?" Daylightgravely demanded."Not on your life," quoth Jones.  "They can't prove it.  You could sayI said so, and I could say I didn't say so, and a hell of a lot thatevidence would amount to with a jury."Daylight went into his office and meditated awhile.  That was it: allthe traffic would bear.  From top to bottom, that was the rule of thegame; and what kept the game going was the fact that a sucker was bornevery minute.  If a Jones were born every minute, the game wouldn'tlast very long.  Lucky for the players that the workers weren't Joneses.But there were other and larger phases of the game.  Little businessmen, shopkeepers, and such ilk took what whack they could out of theproduct of the worker; but, after all, it was the large business menwho formed the workers through the little business men.  When all wassaid and done, the latter, like Jones in Petacha Valley, got no morethan wages out of their whack.  In truth, they were hired men for thelarge business men.  Still again, higher up, were the big fellows.They used vast and complicated paraphernalia for the purpose, on alarge scale of getting between hundreds of thousands of workers andtheir products.  These men were not so much mere robbers as gamblers.And, not content with their direct winnings, being essentiallygamblers, they raided one another.  They called this feature of thegame HIGH FINANCE.  They were all engaged primarily in robbing theworker, but every little while they formed combinations and robbed oneanother of the accumulated loot. This explained thefifty-thousand-dollar raid on him by Holdsworthy and theten-million-dollar raid on him by Dowsett, Letton, and Guggenhammer.And when he raided Panama Mail he had done exactly the same thing.Well, he concluded, it was finer sport robbing the robbers than robbingthe poor stupid workers.Thus, all unread in philosophy, Daylight preempted for himself theposition and vocation of a twentieth-century superman.  He found, withrare and mythical exceptions, that there was no noblesse oblige amongthe business and financial supermen.  As a clever traveler hadannounced in an after-dinner speech at the Alta-Pacific, "There washonor amongst thieves, and this was what distinguished thieves fromhonest men."  That was it.  It hit the nail on the head.  These modernsupermen were a lot of sordid banditti who had the successfuleffrontery to preach a code of right and wrong to their victims whichthey themselves did not practise.  With them, a man's word was goodjust as long as he was compelled to keep it.  THOU SHALT NOT STEAL wasonly applicable to the honest worker.  They, the supermen, were abovesuch commandments.  They certainly stole and were honored by theirfellows according to the magnitude of their stealings.The more Daylight played the game, the clearer the situation grew.Despite the fact that every robber was keen to rob every other robber,the band was well organized.  It practically controlled the politicalmachinery of society, from the ward politician up to the Senate of theUnited States.  It passed laws that gave it privilege to rob.  Itenforced these laws by means of the police, the marshals, the militiaand regular army, and the courts.  And it was a snap.  A superman'schiefest danger was his fellow-superman.  The great stupid mass of thepeople did not count.  They were constituted of such inferior clay thatthe veriest chicanery fooled them.  The superman manipulated thestrings, and when robbery of the workers became too slow or monotonous,they turned loose and robbed one another.Daylight was philosophical, but not a philosopher.  He had never readthe books.  He was a hard-headed, practical man, and farthest from himwas any intention of ever reading the books. He had lived life in thesimple, where books were not necessary for an understanding of life,and now life in the complex appeared just as simple.  He saw throughits frauds and fictions, and found it as elemental as on the Yukon.Men were made of the same stuff.  They had the same passions anddesires.  Finance was poker on a larger scale.  The men who played werethe men who had stakes.  The workers were the fellows toiling forgrubstakes.  He saw the game played out according to the everlastingrules, and he played a hand himself.  The gigantic futility of humanityorganized and befuddled by the bandits did not shock him.  It was thenatural order.  Practically all human endeavors were futile. He hadseen so much of it.  His partners had starved and died on the Stewart.Hundreds of old-timers had failed to locate on Bonanza and Eldorado,while Swedes and chechaquos had come in on the moose-pasture andblindly staked millions.  It was life, and life was a savageproposition at best.  Men in civilization robbed because they were somade.  They robbed just as cats scratched, famine pinched, and frostbit.So it was that Daylight became a successful financier.  He did not goin for swindling the workers.  Not only did he not have the heart forit, but it did not strike him as a sporting proposition.  The workerswere so easy, so stupid. It was more like slaughtering fat hand-rearedpheasants on the English preserves he had heard about.  The sport tohim, was in waylaying the successful robbers and taking their spoilsfrom them.  There was fun and excitement in that, and sometimes theyput up the very devil of a fight. Like Robin Hood of old, Daylightproceeded to rob the rich; and, in a small way, to distribute to theneedy.But he was charitable after his own fashion.  The great mass of humanmisery meant nothing to him.  That was part of the everlasting order.He had no patience with the organized charities and the professionalcharity mongers.  Nor, on the other hand, was what he gave a consciencedole.  He owed no man, and restitution was unthinkable.  What he gavewas a largess, a free, spontaneous gift; and it was for those abouthim.  He never contributed to an earthquake fund in Japan nor to anopen-air fund in New York City.  Instead, he financed Jones, theelevator boy, for a year that he might write a book.  When he learnedthat the wife of his waiter at the St. Francis was suffering fromtuberculosis, he sent her to Arizona, and later, when her case wasdeclared hopeless, he sent the husband, too, to be with her to the end.Likewise, he bought a string of horse-hair bridles from a convict in aWestern penitentiary, who spread the good news until it seemed toDaylight that half the convicts in that institution were making bridlesfor him.  He bought them all, paying from twenty to fifty dollars eachfor them.  They were beautiful and honest things, and he decorated allthe available wall-space of his bedroom with them.The grim Yukon life had failed to make Daylight hard.  It requiredcivilization to produce this result.  In the fierce, savage game he nowplayed, his habitual geniality imperceptibly slipped away from him, asdid his lazy Western drawl.  As his speech became sharp and nervous, sodid his mental processes.  In the swift rush of the game he found lessand less time to spend on being merely good-natured.  The change markedhis face itself.The lines grew sterner.  Less often appeared the playful curl of hislips, the smile in the wrinkling corners of his eyes.  The eyesthemselves, black and flashing, like an Indian's, betrayed glints ofcruelty and brutal consciousness of power.  His tremendous vitalityremained, and radiated from all his being, but it was vitality underthe new aspect of the man-trampling man-conqueror.  His battles withelemental nature had been, in a way, impersonal; his present battleswere wholly with the males of his species, and the hardships of thetrail, the river, and the frost marred him far less than the bitterkeenness of the struggle with his fellows.He still had recrudescence of geniality, but they were largelyperiodical and forced, and they were usually due to the cocktails hetook prior to meal-time.  In the North, he had drunk deeply and atirregular intervals; but now his drinking became systematic anddisciplined.  It was an unconscious development, but it was based uponphysical and mental condition.  The cocktails served as an inhibition.Without reasoning or thinking about it, the strain of the office, whichwas essentially due to the daring and audacity of his ventures,required check or cessation; and he found, through the weeks andmonths, that the cocktails supplied this very thing.  They constituteda stone wall.  He never drank during the morning, nor in office hours;but the instant he left the office he proceeded to rear this wall ofalcoholic inhibition athwart his consciousness.  The office becameimmediately a closed affair.  It ceased to exist.  In the afternoon,after lunch, it lived again for one or two hours, when, leaving it, herebuilt the wall of inhibition.  Of course, there were exceptions tothis; and, such was the rigor of his discipline, that if he had adinner or a conference before him in which, in a business way, heencountered enemies or allies and planned or prosecuted campaigns, heabstained from drinking.  But the instant the business was settled, hiseverlasting call went out for a Martini, and for a double-Martini atthat, served in a long glass so as not to excite comment.CHAPTER VIInto Daylight's life came Dede Mason.  She came rather imperceptibly.He had accepted her impersonally along with the office furnishing, theoffice boy, Morrison, the chief, confidential, and only clerk, and allthe rest of the accessories of a superman's gambling place of business.Had he been asked any time during the first months she was in hisemploy, he would have been unable to tell the color of her eyes.  Fromthe fact that she was a demiblonde, there resided dimly in hissubconsciousness a conception that she was a brunette.  Likewise he hadan idea that she was not thin, while there was an absence in his mindof any idea that she was fat.  As to how she dressed, he had no ideasat all.  He had no trained eye in such matters, nor was he interested.He took it for granted, in the lack of any impression to the contrary,that she was dressed some how.  He knew her as "Miss Mason," and thatwas all, though he was aware that as a stenographer she seemed quickand accurate.  This impression, however, was quite vague, for he hadhad no experience with other stenographers, and naturally believed thatthey were all quick and accurate.One morning, signing up letters, he came upon an I shall. Glancingquickly over the page for similar constructions, he found a number of Iwills.  The I shall was alone.  It stood out conspicuously.  He pressedthe call-bell twice, and a moment later Dede Mason entered.  "Did I saythat, Miss Mason?" he asked, extending the letter to her and pointingout the criminal phrase.  A shade of annoyance crossed her face.  Shestood convicted."My mistake," she said.  "I am sorry.  But it's not a mistake, youknow," she added quickly."How do you make that out?" challenged Daylight.  "It sure don't soundright, in my way of thinking."She had reached the door by this time, and now turned the offendingletter in her hand.  "It's right just the same.""But that would make all those I wills wrong, then," he argued."It does," was her audacious answer.  "Shall I change them?""I shall be over to look that affair up on Monday."  Daylight repeatedthe sentence from the letter aloud.  He did it with a grave, seriousair, listening intently to the sound of his own voice.  He shook hishead.  "It don't sound right, Miss Mason. It just don't sound right.Why, nobody writes to me that way. They all say I will--educated men,too, some of them.  Ain't that so?""Yes," she acknowledged, and passed out to her machine to make thecorrection.It chanced that day that among the several men with whom he sat atluncheon was a young Englishman, a mining engineer.  Had it happenedany other time it would have passed unnoticed, but, fresh from the tiltwith his stenographer, Daylight was struck immediately by theEnglishman's I shall.  Several times, in the course of the meal, thephrase was repeated, and Daylight was certain there was no mistakeabout it.After luncheon he cornered Macintosh, one of the members whom he knewto have been a college man, because of his football reputation."Look here, Bunny," Daylight demanded, "which is right, I shall be overto look that affair up on Monday, or I will be over to look that affairup on Monday?"The ex-football captain debated painfully for a minute.  "Blessed if Iknow," he confessed.  "Which way do I say it?""Oh, I will, of course.""Then the other is right, depend upon it.  I always was rotten ongrammar."On the way back to the office, Daylight dropped into a bookstore andbought a grammar; and for a solid hour, his feet up on the desk, hetoiled through its pages.  "Knock off my head with little apples if thegirl ain't right," he communed aloud at the end of the session.  Forthe first time it struck him that there was something about hisstenographer.  He had accepted her up to then, as a female creature anda bit of office furnishing.  But now, having demonstrated that she knewmore grammar than did business men and college graduates, she became anindividual. She seemed to stand out in his consciousness asconspicuously as the I shall had stood out on the typed page, and hebegan to take notice.He managed to watch her leaving that afternoon, and he was aware forthe first time that she was well-formed, and that her manner of dresswas satisfying.  He knew none of the details of women's dress, and hesaw none of the details of her neat shirt-waist and well-cut tailorsuit.  He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.  She lookedright.  This was in the absence of anything wrong or out of the way."She's a trim little good-looker," was his verdict, when the outeroffice door closed on her.The next morning, dictating, he concluded that he liked the way she didher hair, though for the life of him he could have given no descriptionof it.  The impression was pleasing, that was all.She sat between him and the window, and he noted that her hair waslight brown, with hints of golden bronze.  A pale sun, shining in,touched the golden bronze into smouldering fires that were verypleasing to behold.  Funny, he thought, that he had never observed thisphenomenon before.In the midst of the letter he came to the construction which had causedthe trouble the day before.  He remembered his wrestle with thegrammar, and dictated."I shall meet you halfway this proposition--"Miss Mason gave a quick look up at him.  The action was purelyinvoluntary, and, in fact, had been half a startle of surprise. Thenext instant her eyes had dropped again, and she sat waiting to go onwith the dictation.  But in that moment of her glance Daylight hadnoted that her eyes were gray.  He was later to learn that at timesthere were golden lights in those same gray eyes; but he had seenenough, as it was, to surprise him, for he became suddenly aware thathe had always taken her for a brunette with brown eyes, as a matter ofcourse."You were right, after all," he confessed, with a sheepish grin thatsat incongruously on his stern, Indian-like features.Again he was rewarded by an upward glance and an acknowledging smile,and this time he verified the fact that her eyes were gray."But it don't sound right, just the same," he complained.  At this shelaughed outright."I beg your pardon," she hastened to make amends, and then spoiled itby adding, "but you are so funny."Daylight began to feel a slight awkwardness, and the sun would persistin setting her hair a-smouldering."I didn't mean to be funny," he said."That was why I laughed.  But it is right, and perfectly good grammar.""All right," he sighed--"I shall meet you halfway in thisproposition--got that?" And the dictation went on.  He discovered thatin the intervals, when she had nothing to do, she read books andmagazines, or worked on some sort of feminine fancy work.Passing her desk, once, he picked up a volume of Kipling's poems andglanced bepuzzled through the pages.  "You like reading, Miss Mason?"he said, laying the book down."Oh, yes," was her answer; "very much."Another time it was a book of Wells', The Wheels of Change. "What's itall about?" Daylight asked."Oh, it's just a novel, a love-story."  She stopped, but he still stoodwaiting, and she felt it incumbent to go on."It's about a little Cockney draper's assistant, who takes a vacationon his bicycle, and falls in with a young girl very much above him.Her mother is a popular writer and all that.  And the situation is verycurious, and sad, too, and tragic.  Would you care to read it?""Does he get her?" Daylight demanded."No; that's the point of it.  He wasn't--""And he doesn't get her, and you've read all them pages, hundreds ofthem, to find that out?" Daylight muttered in amazement.Miss Mason was nettled as well as amused."But you read the mining and financial news by the hour," she retorted."But I sure get something out of that.  It's business, and it'sdifferent.  I get money out of it.  What do you get out of books?""Points of view, new ideas, life.""Not worth a cent cash.""But life's worth more than cash," she argued."Oh, well," he said, with easy masculine tolerance, "so long as youenjoy it.  That's what counts, I suppose; and there's no accounting fortaste."Despite his own superior point of view, he had an idea that she knew alot, and he experienced a fleeting feeling like that of a barbarianface to face with the evidence of some tremendous culture.  To Daylightculture was a worthless thing, and yet, somehow, he was vaguelytroubled by a sense that there was more in culture than he imagined.Again, on her desk, in passing, he noticed a book with which he wasfamiliar.  This time he did not stop, for he had recognized the cover.It was a magazine correspondent's book on the Klondike, and he knewthat he and his photograph figured in it and he knew, also, of acertain sensational chapter concerned with a woman's suicide, and withone "Too much Daylight."After that he did not talk with her again about books.  He imaginedwhat erroneous conclusions she had drawn from that particular chapter,and it stung him the more in that they were undeserved. Of all unlikelythings, to have the reputation of being a lady-killer,--he, BurningDaylight,--and to have a woman kill herself out of love for him.  Hefelt that he was a most unfortunate man and wondered by what luck thatone book of all the thousands of books should have fallen into hisstenographer's hands.  For some days afterward he had an uncomfortablesensation of guiltiness whenever he was in Miss Mason's presence; andonce he was positive that he caught her looking at him with a curious,intent gaze, as if studying what manner of man he was.He pumped Morrison, the clerk, who had first to vent his personalgrievance against Miss Mason before he could tell what little he knewof her."She comes from Siskiyou County.  She's very nice to work with in theoffice, of course, but she's rather stuck on herself--exclusive, youknow.""How do you make that out?" Daylight queried."Well, she thinks too much of herself to associate with those she workswith, in the office here, for instance.  She won't have anything to dowith a fellow, you see.  I've asked her out repeatedly, to the theatreand the chutes and such things.  But nothing doing.  Says she likesplenty of sleep, and can't stay up late, and has to go all the way toBerkeley--that's where she lives."This phase of the report gave Daylight a distinct satisfaction. She wasa bit above the ordinary, and no doubt about it.  But Morrison's nextwords carried a hurt."But that's all hot air.  She's running with the University boys,that's what she's doing.  She needs lots of sleep and can't go to thetheatre with me, but she can dance all hours with them.  I've heard itpretty straight that she goes to all their hops and such things.Rather stylish and high-toned for a stenographer, I'd say.  And shekeeps a horse, too.  She rides astride all over those hills out there.I saw her one Sunday myself.  Oh, she's a high-flyer, and I wonder howshe does it.  Sixty-five a month don't go far.  Then she has a sickbrother, too.""Live with her people?" Daylight asked."No; hasn't got any.  They were well to do, I've heard.  They must havebeen, or that brother of hers couldn't have gone to the University ofCalifornia.  Her father had a big cattle-ranch, but he got to foolingwith mines or something, and went broke before he died.  Her motherdied long before that.  Her brother must cost a lot of money.  He was ahusky once, played football, was great on hunting and being out in themountains and such things. He got his accident breaking horses, andthen rheumatism or something got into him.  One leg is shorter than theother and withered up some.  He has to walk on crutches.  I saw her outwith him once--crossing the ferry.  The doctors have been experimentingon him for years, and he's in the French Hospital now, I think."All of which side-lights on Miss Mason went to increase Daylight'sinterest in her.  Yet, much as he desired, he failed to get acquaintedwith her.  He had thoughts of asking her to luncheon, but his was theinnate chivalry of the frontiersman, and the thoughts never came toanything.  He knew a self-respecting, square-dealing man was notsupposed to take his stenographer to luncheon.  Such things did happen,he knew, for he heard the chaffing gossip of the club; but he did notthink much of such men and felt sorry for the girls.  He had a strangenotion that a man had less rights over those he employed than over mereacquaintances or strangers.  Thus, had Miss Mason not been hisemployee, he was confident that he would have had her to luncheon orthe theatre in no time.  But he felt that it was an imposition for anemployer, because he bought the time of an employee in working hours,to presume in any way upon any of the rest of that employee's time.  Todo so was to act like a bully. The situation was unfair.  It was takingadvantage of the fact that the employee was dependent on one for alivelihood.  The employee might permit the imposition through fear ofangering the employer and not through any personal inclination at all.In his own case he felt that such an imposition would be peculiarlyobnoxious, for had she not read that cursed Klondike correspondent'sbook?  A pretty idea she must have of him, a girl that was toohigh-toned to have anything to do with a good-looking, gentlemanlyfellow like Morrison.  Also, and down under all his other reasons,Daylight was timid.  The only thing he had ever been afraid of in hislife was woman, and he had been afraid all his life.  Nor was thattimidity to be put easily to flight now that he felt the firstglimmering need and desire for woman.  The specter of the apron-stringstill haunted him, and helped him to find excuses for getting on noforwarder with Dede Mason.CHAPTER VIINot being favored by chance in getting acquainted with Dede Mason,Daylight's interest in her slowly waned.  This was but natural, for hewas plunged deep in hazardous operations, and the fascinations of thegame and the magnitude of it accounted for all the energy that even hismagnificent organism could generate.Such was his absorption that the pretty stenographer slowly andimperceptibly faded from the forefront of his consciousness. Thus, thefirst faint spur, in the best sense, of his need for woman ceased toprod.  So far as Dede Mason was concerned, he possessed no more than acomplacent feeling of satisfaction in that he had a very nicestenographer.  And, completely to put the quietus on any last lingeringhopes he might have had of her, he was in the thick of his spectacularand intensely bitter fight with the Coastwise Steam Navigation Company,and the Hawaiian, Nicaraguan, and Pacific-Mexican Steamship-Company.He stirred up a bigger muss than he had anticipated, and even he wasastounded at the wide ramifications of the struggle and at theunexpected and incongruous interests that were drawn into it. Everynewspaper in San Francisco turned upon him.  It was true, one or two ofthem had first intimated that they were open to subsidization, butDaylight's judgment was that the situation did not warrant suchexpenditure.  Up to this time the press had been amusingly tolerant andgood-naturedly sensational about him, but now he was to learn whatvirulent scrupulousness an antagonized press was capable of.  Everyepisode of his life was resurrected to serve as foundations formalicious fabrications.  Daylight was frankly amazed at the newinterpretation put upon all he had accomplished and the deeds he haddone.  From an Alaskan hero he was metamorphosed into an Alaskan bully,liar, desperado, and all around "bad Man."  Not content with this, liesupon lies, out of whole cloth, were manufactured about him.  He neverreplied, though once he went to the extent of disburdening his mind tohalf a dozen reporters.  "Do your damnedest," he told them. "BurningDaylight's bucked bigger things than your dirty, lying sheets.  And Idon't blame you, boys... that is, not much. You can't help it.  You'vegot to live.  There's a mighty lot of women in this world that maketheir living in similar fashion to yours, because they're not able todo anything better. Somebody's got to do the dirty work, and it mightas well be you. You're paid for it, and you ain't got the backbone torustle cleaner jobs."The socialist press of the city jubilantly exploited this utterance,scattering it broadcast over San Francisco in tens of thousands ofpaper dodgers.  And the journalists, stung to the quick, retaliatedwith the only means in their power-printer's ink abuse.  The attackbecame bitterer than ever.  The whole affair sank to the deeper deepsof rancor and savageness.  The poor woman who had killed herself wasdragged out of her grave and paraded on thousands of reams of paper asa martyr and a victim to Daylight's ferocious brutality.  Staid,statistical articles were published, proving that he had made his startby robbing poor miners of their claims, and that the capstone to hisfortune had been put in place by his treacherous violation of faithwith the Guggenhammers in the deal on Ophir.  And there were editorialswritten in which he was called an enemy of society, possessed of themanners and culture of a caveman, a fomenter of wasteful businesstroubles, the destroyer of the city's prosperity in commerce and trade,an anarchist of dire menace; and one editorial gravely recommended thathanging would be a lesson to him and his ilk, and concluded with thefervent hope that some day his big motor-car would smash up and smashhim with it.He was like a big bear raiding a bee-hive and, regardless of thestings, he obstinately persisted in pawing for the honey.  He grittedhis teeth and struck back.  Beginning with a raid on two steamshipcompanies, it developed into a pitched battle with a city, a state, anda continental coastline.  Very well; they wanted fight, and they wouldget it.  It was what he wanted, and he felt justified in having comedown from the Klondike, for here he was gambling at a bigger table thanever the Yukon had supplied.  Allied with him, on a splendid salary,with princely pickings thrown in, was a lawyer, Larry Hegan, a youngIrishman with a reputation to make, and whose peculiar genius had beenunrecognized until Daylight picked up with him.  Hegan had Celticimagination and daring, and to such degree that Daylight's cooler headwas necessary as a check on his wilder visions.  Hegan's was aNapoleonic legal mind, without balance, and it was just this balancethat Daylight supplied.  Alone, the Irishman was doomed to failure, butdirected by Daylight, he was on the highroad to fortune andrecognition.  Also, he was possessed of no more personal or civicconscience than Napoleon.It was Hegan who guided Daylight through the intricacies of modernpolitics, labor organization, and commercial and corporation law.  Itwas Hegan, prolific of resource and suggestion, who opened Daylight'seyes to undreamed possibilities in twentieth-century warfare; and itwas Daylight, rejecting, accepting, and elaborating, who planned thecampaigns and prosecuted them.  With the Pacific coast from PeugeotSound to Panama, buzzing and humming, and with San Francisco furiouslyabout his ears, the two big steamship companies had all the appearanceof winning.  It looked as if Burning Daylight was being beaten slowlyto his knees.  And then he struck--at the steamship companies, at SanFrancisco, at the whole Pacific coast.It was not much of a blow at first.  A Christian Endeavor conventionbeing held in San Francisco, a row was started by Express Drivers'Union No. 927 over the handling of a small heap of baggage at the FerryBuilding.  A few heads were broken, a score of arrests made, and thebaggage was delivered.  No one would have guessed that behind thispetty wrangle was the fine Irish hand of Hegan, made potent by theKlondike gold of Burning Daylight.  It was an insignificant affair atbest--or so it seemed.  But the Teamsters' Union took up the quarrel,backed by the whole Water Front Federation.  Step by step, the strikebecame involved.  A refusal of cooks and waiters to serve scabteamsters or teamsters' employers brought out the cooks and waiters.The butchers and meat-cutters refused to handle meat destined forunfair restaurants.  The combined Employers' Associations put up asolid front, and found facing them the 40,000 organized laborers of SanFrancisco.  The restaurant bakers and the bakery wagon drivers struck,followed by the milkers, milk drivers, and chicken pickers.  Thebuilding trades asserted its position in unambiguous terms, and all SanFrancisco was in turmoil.But still, it was only San Francisco.  Hegan's intrigues were masterly,and Daylight's campaign steadily developed.  The powerful fightingorganization known as the Pacific Slope Seaman's Union refused to workvessels the cargoes of which were to be handled by scab longshoremenand freight-handlers.  The union presented its ultimatum, and thencalled a strike.  This had been Daylight's objective all the time.Every incoming coastwise vessel was boarded by the union officials andits crew sent ashore.  And with the Seamen went the firemen, theengineers, and the sea cooks and waiters.  Daily the number of idlesteamers increased.  It was impossible to get scab crews, for the menof the Seaman's Union were fighters trained in the hard school of thesea, and when they went out it meant blood and death to scabs.  Thisphase of the strike spread up and down the entire Pacific coast, untilall the ports were filled with idle ships, and sea transportation wasat a standstill.  The days and weeks dragged out, and the strike held.The Coastwise Steam Navigation Company, and the Hawaiian, Nicaraguan,and Pacific-Mexican Steamship Company were tied up completely.  Theexpenses of combating the strike were tremendous, and they were earningnothing, while daily the situation went from bad to worse, until "peaceat any price" became the cry.  And still there was no peace, untilDaylight and his allies played out their hand, raked in the winnings,and allowed a goodly portion of a continent to resume business.It was noted, in following years, that several leaders of workmen builtthemselves houses and blocks of renting flats and took trips to the oldcountries, while, more immediately, other leaders and "dark horses"came to political preferment and the control of the municipalgovernment and the municipal moneys.  In fact, San Francisco'sboss-ridden condition was due in greater degree to Daylight'swidespreading battle than even San Francisco ever dreamed.  For thepart he had played, the details of which were practically all rumor andguesswork, quickly leaked out, and in consequence he became amuch-execrated and well-hated man. Nor had Daylight himself dreamedthat his raid on the steamship companies would have grown to suchcolossal proportions.But he had got what he was after.  He had played an exciting hand andwon, beating the steamship companies down into the dust and mercilesslyrobbing the stockholders by perfectly legal methods before he let go.Of course, in addition to the large sums of money he had paid over, hisallies had rewarded themselves by gobbling the advantages which laterenabled them to loot the city.  His alliance with a gang of cutthroatshad brought about a lot of cutthroating.  But his conscience sufferedno twinges.  He remembered what he had once heard an old preacherutter, namely, that they who rose by the sword perished by the sword.One took his chances when he played with cutting throats, and his,Daylight's, throat was still intact.  That was it!  And he had won.  Itwas all gamble and war between the strong men.  The fools did notcount.  They were always getting hurt; and that they always had beengetting hurt was the conclusion he drew from what little he knew ofhistory.  San Francisco had wanted war, and he had given it war.  Itwas the game.  All the big fellows did the same, and they did muchworse, too."Don't talk to me about morality and civic duty," he replied to apersistent interviewer.  "If you quit your job tomorrow and went towork on another paper, you would write just what you were told towrite.  It's morality and civic duty now with you; on the new job itwould be backing up a thieving railroad with... morality and civicduty, I suppose.  Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.That's what you sell for.  But your paper would sell for a bit more.Pay its price to-day, and it would shift its present rotten policy tosome other rotten policy; but it would never let up on morality andcivic duty."And all because a sucker is born every minute.  So long as the peoplestand for it, they'll get it good and plenty, my son.  And theshareholders and business interests might as well shut up squawkingabout how much they've been hurt.  You never hear ary squeal out ofthem when they've got the other fellow down and are gouging him.  Thisis the time THEY got gouged, and that's all there is to it.  Talk aboutmollycoddles!  Son, those same fellows would steal crusts from starvingmen and pull gold fillings from the mouths of corpses, yep, and squawklike Sam Scratch if some blamed corpse hit back.  They're all tarredwith the same brush, little and big.  Look at your Sugar Trust--withall its millions stealing water like a common thief from New York City,and short-weighing the government on its phoney scales. Morality andcivic duty!  Son, forget it."CHAPTER VIIIDaylight's coming to civilization had not improved him.  True, he worebetter clothes, had learned slightly better manners, and spoke betterEnglish.  As a gambler and a man-trampler he had developed remarkableefficiency.  Also, he had become used to a higher standard of living,and he had whetted his wits to razor sharpness in the fierce,complicated struggle of fighting males. But he had hardened, and at theexpense of his old-time, whole-souled geniality.  Of the essentialrefinements of civilization he knew nothing.  He did not know theyexisted.  He had become cynical, bitter, and brutal.  Power had itseffect on him that it had on all men.  Suspicious of the bigexploiters, despising the fools of the exploited herd, he had faithonly in himself.  This led to an undue and erroneous exaltation of hisego, while kindly consideration of others--nay, even simplerespect--was destroyed, until naught was left for him but to worship atthe shrine of self.  Physically, he was not the man of iron muscles whohad come down out of the Arctic.  He did not exercise sufficiently, atemore than was good for him, and drank altogether too much.  His muscleswere getting flabby, and his tailor called attention to his increasingwaistband.  In fact, Daylight was developing a definite paunch.  Thisphysical deterioration was manifest likewise in his face.  The leanIndian visage was suffering a city change.  The slight hollows in thecheeks under the high cheek-bones had filled out.  The beginning ofpuff-sacks under the eyes was faintly visible.  The girth of the neckhad increased, and the first crease and fold of a double chin werebecoming plainly discernible.  The old effect of asceticism, bred ofterrific hardships and toil, had vanished; the features had becomebroader and heavier, betraying all the stigmata of the life he lived,advertising the man's self-indulgence, harshness, and brutality.Even his human affiliations were descending.  Playing a lone hand,contemptuous of most of the men with whom he played, lacking insympathy or understanding of them, and certainly independent of them,he found little in common with those to be encountered, say at theAlta-Pacific.  In point of fact, when the battle with the steamshipcompanies was at its height and his raid was inflicting incalculabledamage on all business interests, he had been asked to resign from theAlta-Pacific. The idea had been rather to his liking, and he had foundnew quarters in clubs like the Riverside, organized and practicallymaintained by the city bosses.  He found that he really liked such menbetter.  They were more primitive and simple, and they did not put onairs.  They were honest buccaneers, frankly in the game for what theycould get out of it, on the surface more raw and savage, but at leastnot glossed over with oily or graceful hypocrisy.  The Alta-Pacific hadsuggested that his resignation be kept a private matter, and then hadprivily informed the newspapers.  The latter had made great capital outof the forced resignation, but Daylight had grinned and silently gonehis way, though registering a black mark against more than one clubmember who was destined to feel, in the days to come, the crushingweight of the Klondiker's financial paw.The storm-centre of a combined newspaper attack lasting for months,Daylight's character had been torn to shreds.  There was no fact in hishistory that had not been distorted into a criminality or a vice.  Thispublic making of him over into an iniquitous monster had pretty wellcrushed any lingering hope he had of getting acquainted with DedeMason.  He felt that there was no chance for her ever to look kindly ona man of his caliber, and, beyond increasing her salary to seventy-fivedollars a month, he proceeded gradually to forget about her.  Theincrease was made known to her through Morrison, and later she thankedDaylight, and that was the end of it.One week-end, feeling heavy and depressed and tired of the city and itsways, he obeyed the impulse of a whim that was later to play animportant part in his life.  The desire to get out of the city for awhiff of country air and for a change of scene was the cause.  Yet, tohimself, he made the excuse of going to Glen Ellen for the purpose ofinspecting the brickyard with which Holdsworthy had goldbricked him.He spent the night in the little country hotel, and on Sunday morning,astride a saddle-horse rented from the Glen Ellen butcher, rode out ofthe village.  The brickyard was close at hand on the flat beside theSonoma Creek.  The kilns were visible among the trees, when he glancedto the left and caught sight of a cluster of wooded knolls half a mileaway, perched on the rolling slopes of Sonoma Mountain.  The mountain,itself wooded, towered behind.  The trees on the knolls seemed tobeckon to him.The dry, early-summer air, shot through with sunshine, was wine to him.Unconsciously he drank it in deep breaths.  The prospect of thebrickyard was uninviting.  He was jaded with all things business, andthe wooded knolls were calling to him.  A horse was between his legs--agood horse, he decided; one that sent him back to the cayuses he hadridden during his eastern Oregon boyhood. He had been somewhat of arider in those early days, and the champ of bit and creak ofsaddle-leather sounded good to him now.Resolving to have his fun first, and to look over the brickyardafterward, he rode on up the hill, prospecting for a way across countryto get to the knolls.  He left the country road at the first gate hecame to and cantered through a hayfield.  The grain was waist-high oneither side the wagon road, and he sniffed the warm aroma of it withdelighted nostrils.  Larks flew up before him, and from everywhere camemellow notes.  From the appearance of the road it was patent that ithad been used for hauling clay to the now idle brickyard.  Salving hisconscience with the idea that this was part of the inspection, he rodeon to the clay-pit--a huge scar in a hillside.  But he did not lingerlong, swinging off again to the left and leaving the road.  Not afarm-house was in sight, and the change from the city crowding wasessentially satisfying.  He rode now through open woods, across littleflower-scattered glades, till he came upon a spring.  Flat on theground, he drank deeply of the clear water, and, looking about him,felt with a shock the beauty of the world.  It came to him like adiscovery; he had never realized it before, he concluded, and also, hehad forgotten much.  One could not sit in at high finance and keeptrack of such things.  As he drank in the air, the scene, and thedistant song of larks, he felt like a poker-player rising from anight-long table and coming forth from the pent atmosphere to taste thefreshness of the morn.At the base of the knolls he encountered a tumble-down stake-and-riderfence.  From the look of it he judged it must be forty years old atleast--the work of some first pioneer who had taken up the land whenthe days of gold had ended.  The woods were very thick here, yet fairlyclear of underbrush, so that, while the blue sky was screened by thearched branches, he was able to ride beneath.  He now found himself ina nook of several acres, where the oak and manzanita and madrono gaveway to clusters of stately redwoods.  Against the foot of asteep-sloped knoll he came upon a magnificent group of redwoods thatseemed to have gathered about a tiny gurgling spring.He halted his horse, for beside the spring uprose a wild Californialily.  It was a wonderful flower, growing there in the cathedral naveof lofty trees.  At least eight feet in height, its stem rose straightand slender, green and bare for two-thirds its length, and then burstinto a shower of snow-white waxen bells.  There were hundreds of theseblossoms, all from the one stem, delicately poised and ethereallyfrail.  Daylight had never seen anything like it.  Slowly his gazewandered from it to all that was about him.  He took off his hat, withalmost a vague religious feeling.  This was different.  No room forcontempt and evil here.  This was clean and fresh andbeautiful-something he could respect.  It was like a church.  Theatmosphere was one of holy calm.  Here man felt the prompting of noblerthings.  Much of this and more was in Daylight's heart as he lookedabout him. But it was not a concept of his mind.  He merely felt itwithout thinking about it at all.On the steep incline above the spring grew tiny maidenhair ferns, whilehigher up were larger ferns and brakes.  Great, moss-covered trunks offallen trees lay here and there, slowly sinking back and merging intothe level of the forest mould. Beyond, in a slightly clearer space,wild grape and honeysuckle swung in green riot from gnarled old oaktrees.  A gray Douglas squirrel crept out on a branch and watched him.From somewhere came the distant knocking of a woodpecker.  This sounddid not disturb the hush and awe of the place.  Quiet woods, noisesbelonged there and made the solitude complete.  The tiny bubblingripple of the spring and the gray flash of tree-squirrel were asyardsticks with which to measure the silence and motionless repose."Might be a million miles from anywhere," Daylight whispered to himself.But ever his gaze returned to the wonderful lily beside the bubblingspring.He tethered the horse and wandered on foot among the knolls. Their topswere crowned with century-old spruce trees, and their sides clothedwith oaks and madronos and native holly.  But to the perfect redwoodsbelonged the small but deep canon that threaded its way among theknolls.  Here he found no passage out for his horse, and he returned tothe lily beside the spring.  On foot, tripping, stumbling, leading theanimal, he forced his way up the hillside.  And ever the ferns carpetedthe way of his feet, ever the forest climbed with him and archedoverhead, and ever the clean joy and sweetness stole in upon his senses.On the crest he came through an amazing thicket of velvet-trunked youngmadronos, and emerged on an open hillside that led down into a tinyvalley.  The sunshine was at first dazzling in its brightness, and hepaused and rested, for he was panting from the exertion.  Not of oldhad he known shortness of breath such as this, and muscles that soeasily tired at a stiff climb.  A tiny stream ran down the tiny valleythrough a tiny meadow that was carpeted knee-high with grass and blueand white nemophila.  The hillside was covered with Mariposa lilies andwild hyacinth, down through which his horse dropped slowly, withcircumspect feet and reluctant gait.Crossing the stream, Daylight followed a faint cattle trail over a low,rocky hill and through a wine-wooded forest of manzanita, and emergedupon another tiny valley, down which filtered another spring-fed,meadow-bordered streamlet.  A jack-rabbit bounded from a bush under hishorse's nose, leaped the stream, and vanished up the opposite hillsideof scrub-oak.  Daylight watched it admiringly as he rode on to the headof the meadow.  Here he startled up a many-pronged buck, that seemed tosoar across the meadow, and to soar over the stake-and-rider fence,and, still soaring, disappeared in a friendly copse beyond.Daylight's delight was unbounded.  It seemed to him that he had neverbeen so happy.  His old woods' training was aroused, and he was keenlyinterested in everything in the moss on the trees and branches; in thebunches of mistletoe hanging in the oaks; in the nest of a wood-rat; inthe water-cress growing in the sheltered eddies of the little stream;in the butterflies drifting through the rifted sunshine and shadow; inthe blue jays that flashed in splashes of gorgeous color across theforest aisles; in the tiny birds, like wrens, that hopped among thebushes and imitated certain minor quail-calls; and in thecrimson-crested woodpecker that ceased its knocking and cocked its headon one side to survey him.  Crossing the stream, he struck faintvestiges of a wood-road, used, evidently, a generation back, when themeadow had been cleared of its oaks.  He found a hawk's nest on thelightning-shattered tipmost top of a six-foot redwood.  And to completeit all his horse stumbled upon several large broods of half-grownquail, and the air was filled with the thrum of their flight.  Hehalted and watched the young ones "petrifying" and disappearing on theground before his eyes, and listening to the anxious calls of the oldones hidden in the thickets."It sure beats country places and bungalows at Menlo Park," he communedaloud; "and if ever I get the hankering for country life, it's me forthis every time."The old wood-road led him to a clearing, where a dozen acres of grapesgrew on wine-red soil.  A cow-path, more trees and thickets, and hedropped down a hillside to the southeast exposure.  Here, poised abovea big forested canon, and looking out upon Sonoma Valley, was a smallfarm-house.  With its barn and outhouses it snuggled into a nook in thehillside, which protected it from west and north.  It was the erosionfrom this hillside, he judged, that had formed the little level stretchof vegetable garden.  The soil was fat and black, and there was waterin plenty, for he saw several faucets running wide open.Forgotten was the brickyard.  Nobody was at home, but Daylightdismounted and ranged the vegetable garden, eating strawberries andgreen peas, inspecting the old adobe barn and the rusty plough andharrow, and rolling and smoking cigarettes while he watched the anticsof several broods of young chickens and the mother hens.  A foottrailthat led down the wall of the big canyon invited him, and he proceededto follow it.  A water-pipe, usually above ground, paralleled thetrail, which he concluded led upstream to the bed of the creek.  Thewall of the canon was several hundred feet from top to bottom, andmagnificent were the untouched trees that the place was plunged inperpetual shade.  He measured with his eye spruces five and six feet indiameter and redwoods even larger.  One such he passed, a twister thatwas at least ten or eleven feet through. The trail led straight to asmall dam where was the intake for the pipe that watered the vegetablegarden.  Here, beside the stream, were alders and laurel trees, and hewalked through fern-brakes higher than his head.  Velvety moss waseverywhere, out of which grew maiden-hair and gold-back ferns.Save for the dam, it was a virgin wild.  No ax had invaded, and thetrees died only of old age and stress of winter storm.  The huge trunksof those that had fallen lay moss-covered, slowly resolving back intothe soil from which they sprang.  Some had lain so long that they werequite gone, though their faint outlines, level with the mould, couldstill be seen.  Others bridged the stream, and from beneath the bulk ofone monster half a dozen younger trees, overthrown and crushed by thefall, growing out along the ground, still lived and prospered, theirroots bathed by the stream, their upshooting branches catching thesunlight through the gap that had been made in the forest roof.Back at the farm-house, Daylight mounted and rode on away from theranch and into the wilder canons and steeper steeps beyond. Nothingcould satisfy his holiday spirit now but the ascent of Sonoma Mountain.And here on the crest, three hours afterward, he emerged, tired andsweaty, garments torn and face and hands scratched, but with sparklingeyes and an unwonted zestfulness of expression.  He felt the illicitpleasure of a schoolboy playing truant.  The big gambling table of SanFrancisco seemed very far away.  But there was more than illicitpleasure in his mood.  It was as though he were going through a sort ofcleansing bath.  No room here for all the sordidness, meanness, andviciousness that filled the dirty pool of city existence.  Withoutpondering in detail upon the matter at all, his sensations were ofpurification and uplift.  Had he been asked to state how he felt, hewould merely have said that he was having a good time; for he wasunaware in his self-consciousness of the potent charm of nature thatwas percolating through his city-rotted body and brain--potent, in thathe came of an abysmal past of wilderness dwellers, while he was himselfcoated with but the thinnest rind of crowded civilization.There were no houses in the summit of Sonoma Mountain, and, all aloneunder the azure California sky, he reined in on the southern edge ofthe peak.  He saw open pasture country, intersected with wooded canons,descending to the south and west from his feet, crease on crease androll on roll, from lower level to lower level, to the floor of PetalumaValley, flat as a billiard-table, a cardboard affair, all patches andsquares of geometrical regularity where the fat freeholds were farmed.Beyond, to the west, rose range on range of mountains cuddling purplemists of atmosphere in their valleys; and still beyond, over the lastrange of all, he saw the silver sheen of the Pacific.  Swinging hishorse, he surveyed the west and north, from Santa Rosa to St. Helena,and on to the east, across Sonoma to the chaparral-covered range thatshut off the view of Napa Valley.  Here, part way up the eastern wallof Sonoma Valley, in range of a line intersecting the little village ofGlen Ellen, he made out a scar upon a hillside.  His first thought wasthat it was the dump of a mine tunnel, but remembering that he was notin gold-bearing country, he dismissed the scar from his mind andcontinued the circle of his survey to the southeast, where, across thewaters of San Pablo Bay, he could see, sharp and distant, the twinpeaks of Mount Diablo.  To the south was Mount Tamalpais, and, yes, hewas right, fifty miles away, where the draughty winds of the Pacificblew in the Golden Gate, the smoke of San Francisco made a low-lyinghaze against the sky."I ain't seen so much country all at once in many a day," he thoughtaloud.He was loath to depart, and it was not for an hour that he was able totear himself away and take the descent of the mountain. Working out anew route just for the fun of it, late afternoon was upon him when hearrived back at the wooded knolls.  Here, on the top of one of them,his keen eyes caught a glimpse of a shade of green sharplydifferentiated from any he had seen all day. Studying it for a minute,he concluded that it was composed of three cypress trees, and he knewthat nothing else than the hand of man could have planted them there.Impelled by curiosity purely boyish, he made up his mind toinvestigate.  So densely wooded was the knoll, and so steep, that hehad to dismount and go up on foot, at times even on hands and kneesstruggling hard to force a way through the thicker underbrush.  He cameout abruptly upon the cypresses.  They were enclosed in a small squareof ancient fence; the pickets he could plainly see had been hewn andsharpened by hand.  Inside were the mounds of two children's graves.Two wooden headboards, likewise hand-hewn, told the state Little David,born 1855, died 1859; and Little Roy, born 1853, died 1860."The poor little kids," Daylight muttered.  The graves showed signs ofrecent care.  Withered bouquets of wild flowers were on the mounds, andthe lettering on the headboards was freshly painted.  Guided by theseclews, Daylight cast about for a trail, and found one leading down theside opposite to his ascent. Circling the base of the knoll, he pickedup with his horse and rode on to the farm-house.  Smoke was rising fromthe chimney and he was quickly in conversation with a nervous, slenderyoung man, who, he learned, was only a tenant on the ranch.  How largewas it?  A matter of one hundred and eighty acres, though it seemedmuch larger.  This was because it was so irregularly shaped. Yes, itincluded the clay-pit and all the knolls, and its boundary that ranalong the big canon was over a mile long."You see," the young man said, "it was so rough and broken that whenthey began to farm this country the farmers bought in the good land tothe edge of it.  That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged."Oh, yes, he and his wife managed to scratch a living without workingtoo hard.  They didn't have to pay much rent.  Hillard, the owner,depended on the income from the clay-pit.  Hillard was well off, andhad big ranches and vineyards down on the flat of the valley.  Thebrickyard paid ten cents a cubic yard for the clay.  As for the rest ofthe ranch, the land was good in patches, where it was cleared, like thevegetable garden and the vineyard, but the rest of it was too muchup-and-down.""You're not a farmer," Daylight said.  The young man laughed and shookhis head.  "No; I'm a telegraph operator.  But the wife and I decidedto take a two years' vacation, and ... here we are. But the time'sabout up.  I'm going back into the office this fall after I get thegrapes off."Yes, there were about eleven acres in the vineyard--wine grapes. Theprice was usually good.  He grew most of what they ate.  If he ownedthe place, he'd clear a patch of land on the side-hill above thevineyard and plant a small home orchard.  The soil was good.  There wasplenty of pasturage all over the ranch, and there were several clearedpatches, amounting to about fifteen acres in all, where he grew as muchmountain hay as could be found.  It sold for three to five dollars morea ton than the rank-stalked valley hay.Daylight listened, there came to him a sudden envy of this young fellowliving right in the midst of all this which Daylight had travelledthrough the last few hours."What in thunder are you going back to the telegraph office for?" hedemanded.The young man smiled with a certain wistfulness.  "Because we can't getahead here..." (he hesitated an instant), "and because there are addedexpenses coming.  The rent, small as it is, counts; and besides, I'mnot strong enough to effectually farm the place.  If I owned it, or ifI were a real husky like you, I'd ask nothing better.  Nor would thewife."  Again the wistful smile hovered on his face.  "You see, we'recountry born, and after bucking with cities for a few years, we kind offeel we like the country best.  We've planned to get ahead, though, andthen some day we'll buy a patch of land and stay with it."The graves of the children?  Yes, he had relettered them and hoed theweeds out.  It had become the custom.  Whoever lived on the ranch didthat.  For years, the story ran, the father and mother had returnedeach summer to the graves.  But there had come a time when they came nomore, and then old Hillard started the custom.  The scar across thevalley?  An old mine.  It had never paid.  The men had worked on it,off and on, for years, for the indications had been good.  But that wasyears and years ago.  No paying mine had ever been struck in thevalley, though there had been no end of prospect-holes put down andthere had been a sort of rush there thirty years back.A frail-looking young woman came to the door to call the young man tosupper.  Daylight's first thought was that city living had not agreedwith her.  And then he noted the slight tan and healthy glow thatseemed added to her face, and he decided that the country was the placefor her.  Declining an invitation to supper, he rode on for Glen Ellensitting slack-kneed in the saddle and softly humming forgotten songs.He dropped down the rough, winding road through covered pasture, withhere and there thickets of manzanita and vistas of open glades.  Helistened greedily to the quail calling, and laughed outright, once, insheer joy, at a tiny chipmunk that fled scolding up a bank, slipping onthe crumbly surface and falling down, then dashing across the roadunder his horse's nose and, still scolding, scrabbling up a protectingoak.Daylight could not persuade himself to keep to the travelled roads thatday, and another cut across country to Glen Ellen brought him upon acanon that so blocked his way that he was glad to follow a friendlycow-path.  This led him to a small frame cabin.  The doors and windowswere open, and a cat was nursing a litter of kittens in the doorway,but no one seemed at home.  He descended the trail that evidentlycrossed the canon.  Part way down, he met an old man coming up throughthe sunset.  In his hand he carried a pail of foamy milk.  He wore nohat, and in his face, framed with snow-white hair and beard, was theruddy glow and content of the passing summer day.  Daylight thoughtthat he had never seen so contented-looking a being."How old are you, daddy?" he queried."Eighty-four," was the reply.  "Yes, sirree, eighty-four, and spryerthan most.""You must a' taken good care of yourself," Daylight suggested."I don't know about that.  I ain't loafed none.  I walked across thePlains with an ox-team and fit Injuns in '51, and I was a family manthen with seven youngsters.  I reckon I was as old then as you are now,or pretty nigh on to it.""Don't you find it lonely here?"The old man shifted the pail of milk and reflected.  "That alldepends," he said oracularly.  "I ain't never been lonely except whenthe old wife died.  Some fellers are lonely in a crowd, and I'm one ofthem.  That's the only time I'm lonely, is when I go to 'Frisco.  But Idon't go no more, thank you 'most to death. This is good enough for me.I've ben right here in this valley since '54--one of the first settlersafter the Spaniards."Daylight started his horse, saying:--"Well, good night, daddy.  Stick with it.  You got all the young bloodsskinned, and I guess you've sure buried a mighty sight of them."The old man chuckled, and Daylight rode on, singularly at peace withhimself and all the world.  It seemed that the old contentment of trailand camp he had known on the Yukon had come back to him.  He could notshake from his eyes the picture of the old pioneer coming up the trailthrough the sunset light.  He was certainly going some for eighty-four.The thought of following his example entered Daylight's mind, but thebig game of San Francisco vetoed the idea."Well, anyway," he decided, "when I get old and quit the game, I'llsettle down in a place something like this, and the city can go tohell."CHAPTER IXInstead of returning to the city on Monday, Daylight rented thebutcher's horse for another day and crossed the bed of the valley toits eastern hills to look at the mine.  It was dryer and rockier herethan where he had been the day before, and the ascending slopessupported mainly chaparral, scrubby and dense and impossible topenetrate on horseback.  But in the canyons water was plentiful andalso a luxuriant forest growth.  The mine was an abandoned affair, buthe enjoyed the half-hour's scramble around.  He had had experience inquartz-mining before he went to Alaska, and he enjoyed therecrudescence of his old wisdom in such matters.  The story was simpleto him: good prospects that warranted the starting of the tunnel intothe sidehill; the three months' work and the getting short of money;the lay-off while the men went away and got jobs; then the return and anew stretch of work, with the "pay" ever luring and ever receding intothe mountain, until, after years of hope, the men had given up andvanished.  Most likely they were dead by now, Daylight thought, as heturned in the saddle and looked back across the canyon at the ancientdump and dark mouth of the tunnel.As on the previous day, just for the joy of it, he followedcattle-trails at haphazard and worked his way up toward the summits.Coming out on a wagon road that led upward, he followed it for severalmiles, emerging in a small, mountain-encircled valley, where half adozen poor ranchers farmed the wine-grapes on the steep slopes.Beyond, the road pitched upward.  Dense chaparral covered the exposedhillsides but in the creases of the canons huge spruce trees grew, andwild oats and flowers.Half an hour later, sheltering under the summits themselves, he cameout on a clearing.  Here and there, in irregular patches where thesteep and the soil favored, wine grapes were growing. Daylight couldsee that it had been a stiff struggle, and that wild nature showedfresh signs of winning--chaparral that had invaded the clearings;patches and parts of patches of vineyard, unpruned, grassgrown, andabandoned; and everywhere old stake-and-rider fences vainly striving toremain intact.  Here, at a small farm-house surrounded by largeoutbuildings, the road ended.  Beyond, the chaparral blocked the way.He came upon an old woman forking manure in the barnyard, and reined inby the fence."Hello, mother," was his greeting; "ain't you got any men-folk aroundto do that for you?"She leaned on her pitchfork, hitched her skirt in at the waist, andregarded him cheerfully.  He saw that her toil-worn, weather-exposedhands were like a man's, callused, large-knuckled, and gnarled, andthat her stockingless feet were thrust into heavy man's brogans."Nary a man," she answered.  "And where be you from, and all the way uphere?  Won't you stop and hitch and have a glass of wine?"Striding clumsily but efficiently, like a laboring-man, she led himinto the largest building, where Daylight saw a hand-press and all theparaphernalia on a small scale for the making of wine.  It was too farand too bad a road to haul the grapes to the valley wineries, sheexplained, and so they were compelled to do it themselves.  "They," helearned, were she and her daughter, the latter a widow of forty-odd.It had been easier before the grandson died and before he went away tofight savages in the Philippines.  He had died out there in battle.Daylight drank a full tumbler of excellent Riesling, talked a fewminutes, and accounted for a second tumbler.  Yes, they just managednot to starve.  Her husband and she had taken up this government landin '57 and cleared it and farmed it ever since, until he died, when shehad carried it on.  It actually didn't pay for the toil, but what werethey to do?  There was the wine trust, and wine was down.  ThatRiesling?  She delivered it to the railroad down in the valley fortwenty-two cents a gallon.  And it was a long haul.  It took a day forthe round trip.  Her daughter was gone now with a load.Daylight knew that in the hotels, Riesling, not quite so good even, wascharged for at from a dollar and a half to two dollars a quart.  Andshe got twenty-two cents a gallon.  That was the game.  She was one ofthe stupid lowly, she and her people before her--the ones that did thework, drove their oxen across the Plains, cleared and broke the virginland, toiled all days and all hours, paid their taxes, and sent theirsons and grandsons out to fight and die for the flag that gave themsuch ample protection that they were able to sell their wine fortwenty-two cents.  The same wine was served to him at the St. Francisfor two dollars a quart, or eight dollars a short gallon.  That was it.Between her and her hand-press on the mountain clearing and himordering his wine in the hotel was a difference of seven dollars andseventy-eight cents.  A clique of sleek men in the city got between herand him to just about that amount.  And, besides them, there was ahorde of others that took their whack.  They called it railroading,high finance, banking, wholesaling, real estate, and such things, butthe point was that they got it, while she got what wasleft,--twenty-two cents.  Oh, well, a sucker was born every minute, hesighed to himself, and nobody was to blame; it was all a game, and onlya few could win, but it was damned hard on the suckers."How old are you, mother?" he asked."Seventy-nine come next January.""Worked pretty hard, I suppose?""Sense I was seven.  I was bound out in Michigan state until I waswoman-grown.  Then I married, and I reckon the work got harder andharder.""When are you going to take a rest?"She looked at him, as though she chose to think his question facetious,and did not reply."Do you believe in God?"She nodded her head."Then you get it all back," he assured her; but in his heart he waswondering about God, that allowed so many suckers to be born and thatdid not break up the gambling game by which they were robbed from thecradle to the grave."How much of that Riesling you got?"She ran her eyes over the casks and calculated.  "Just short of eighthundred gallons."He wondered what he could do with all of it, and speculated as to whomhe could give it away."What would you do if you got a dollar a gallon for it?" he asked."Drop dead, I suppose.""No; speaking seriously.""Get me some false teeth, shingle the house, and buy a new wagon. Theroad's mighty hard on wagons.""And after that?""Buy me a coffin.""Well, they're yours, mother, coffin and all."She looked her incredulity."No; I mean it.  And there's fifty to bind the bargain.  Never mind thereceipt.  It's the rich ones that need watching, their memories beingso infernal short, you know.  Here's my address. You've got to deliverit to the railroad.  And now, show me the way out of here.  I want toget up to the top."On through the chaparral he went, following faint cattle trails andworking slowly upward till he came out on the divide and gazed downinto Napa Valley and back across to Sonoma Mountain... "A sweet land,"he muttered, "an almighty sweet land."Circling around to the right and dropping down along the cattle-trails,he quested for another way back to Sonoma Valley; but the cattle-trailsseemed to fade out, and the chaparral to grow thicker with a deliberateviciousness and even when he won through in places, the canon and smallfeeders were too precipitous for his horse, and turned him back.  Butthere was no irritation about it.  He enjoyed it all, for he was backat his old game of bucking nature.  Late in the afternoon he brokethrough, and followed a well-defined trail down a dry canon. Here hegot a fresh thrill.  He had heard the baying of the hound some minutesbefore, and suddenly, across the bare face of the hill above him, hesaw a large buck in flight.  And not far behind came the deer-hound, amagnificent animal.  Daylight sat tense in his saddle and watched untilthey disappeared, his breath just a trifle shorter, as if he, too, werein the chase, his nostrils distended, and in his bones the old huntingache and memories of the days before he came to live in cities.The dry canon gave place to one with a slender ribbon of running water.The trail ran into a wood-road, and the wood-road emerged across asmall flat upon a slightly travelled county road.  There were no farmsin this immediate section, and no houses.  The soil was meagre, thebed-rock either close to the surface or constituting the surfaceitself.  Manzanita and scrub-oak, however, flourished and walled theroad on either side with a jungle growth.  And out a runway throughthis growth a man suddenly scuttled in a way that reminded Daylight ofa rabbit.He was a little man, in patched overalls; bareheaded, with a cottonshirt open at the throat and down the chest.  The sun was ruddy-brownin his face, and by it his sandy hair was bleached on the ends toperoxide blond.  He signed to Daylight to halt, and held up a letter."If you're going to town, I'd be obliged if you mail this.""I sure will." Daylight put it into his coat pocket."Do you live hereabouts, stranger?"But the little man did not answer.  He was gazing at Daylight in asurprised and steadfast fashion."I know you," the little man announced.  "You're Elam Harnish--BurningDaylight, the papers call you.  Am I right?"Daylight nodded."But what under the sun are you doing here in the chaparral?"Daylight grinned as he answered, "Drumming up trade for a free ruraldelivery route.""Well, I'm glad I wrote that letter this afternoon," the little manwent on, "or else I'd have missed seeing you.  I've seen your photo inthe papers many a time, and I've a good memory for faces.  I recognizedyou at once.  My name's Ferguson.""Do you live hereabouts?" Daylight repeated his query."Oh, yes. I've got a little shack back here in the bush a hundredyards, and a pretty spring, and a few fruit trees and berry bushes.Come in and take a look.  And that spring is a dandy.  You never tastedwater like it.  Come in and try it."Walking and leading his horse, Daylight followed the quick-steppingeager little man through the green tunnel and emerged abruptly upon theclearing, if clearing it might be called, where wild nature and man'searth-scratching were inextricably blended.  It was a tiny nook in thehills, protected by the steep walls of a canon mouth.  Here wereseveral large oaks, evidencing a richer soil.  The erosion of ages fromthe hillside had slowly formed this deposit of fat earth.  Under theoaks, almost buried in them, stood a rough, unpainted cabin, the wideverandah of which, with chairs and hammocks, advertised an out-of doorsbedchamber.  Daylight's keen eyes took in every thing.  The clearingwas irregular, following the patches of the best soil, and every fruittree and berry bush, and even each vegetable plant, had the waterpersonally conducted to it.  The tiny irrigation channels were everywhere, and along some of them the water was running.Ferguson looked eagerly into his visitor's face for signs ofapprobation."What do you think of it, eh?""Hand-reared and manicured, every blessed tree," Daylight laughed, butthe joy and satisfaction that shone in his eyes contented the littleman."Why, d'ye know, I know every one of those trees as if they were sonsof mine.  I planted them, nursed them, fed them, and brought them up.Come on and peep at the spring.""It's sure a hummer," was Daylight's verdict, after due inspection andsampling, as they turned back for the house.The interior was a surprise.  The cooking being done in the small,lean-to kitchen, the whole cabin formed a large living room.  A greattable in the middle was comfortably littered with books and magazines.All the available wall space, from floor to ceiling, was occupied byfilled bookshelves.  It seemed to Daylight that he had never seen somany books assembled in one place.  Skins of wildcat, 'coon, and deerlay about on the pine-board floor."Shot them myself, and tanned them, too," Ferguson proudly asserted.The crowning feature of the room was a huge fireplace of rough stonesand boulders."Built it myself," Ferguson proclaimed, "and, by God, she drew! Never awisp of smoke anywhere save in the pointed channel, and that during thebig southeasters."Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.  Whywas he hiding away here in the chaparral, he and his books?  He wasnobody's fool, anybody could see that.  Then why? The whole affair hada tinge of adventure, and Daylight accepted an invitation to supper,half prepared to find his host a raw-fruit-and-nut-eater or somesimilar sort of health faddest. At table, while eating rice andjack-rabbit curry (the latter shot by Ferguson), they talked it over,and Daylight found the little man had no food "views."  He ate whateverhe liked, and all he wanted, avoiding only such combinations thatexperience had taught him disagreed with his digestion.Next, Daylight surmised that he might be touched with religion; but,quest about as he would, in a conversation covering the most divergenttopics, he could find no hint of queerness or unusualness.  So it was,when between them they had washed and wiped the dishes and put themaway, and had settled down to a comfortable smoke, that Daylight puthis question."Look here, Ferguson.  Ever since we got together, I've been castingabout to find out what's wrong with you, to locate a screw loosesomewhere, but I'll be danged if I've succeeded. What are you doinghere, anyway?  What made you come here?  What were you doing for aliving before you came here?  Go ahead and elucidate yourself."Ferguson frankly showed his pleasure at the questions."First of all," he began, "the doctors wound up by losing all hope forme.  Gave me a few months at best, and that, after a course insanatoriums and a trip to Europe and another to Hawaii.  They triedelectricity, and forced feeding, and fasting. I was a graduate of abouteverything in the curriculum.  They kept me poor with their bills whileI went from bad to worse. The trouble with me was two fold: first, Iwas a born weakling; and next, I was living unnaturally--too much work,and responsibility, and strain.  I was managing editor of theTimes-Tribune--"Daylight gasped mentally, for the Times-Tribune was the biggest andmost influential paper in San Francisco, and always had been so."--and I wasn't strong enough for the strain.  Of course my body wentback on me, and my mind, too, for that matter.  It had to be bolsteredup with whiskey, which wasn't good for it any more than was the livingin clubs and hotels good for my stomach and the rest of me.  That waswhat ailed me; I was living all wrong."He shrugged his shoulders and drew at his pipe."When the doctors gave me up, I wound up my affairs and gave thedoctors up.  That was fifteen years ago.  I'd been hunting through herewhen I was a boy, on vacations from college, and when I was all downand out it seemed a yearning came to me to go back to the country.  SoI quit, quit everything, absolutely, and came to live in the Valley ofthe Moon--that's the Indian name, you know, for Sonoma Valley.  I livedin the lean-to the first year; then I built the cabin and sent for mybooks.  I never knew what happiness was before, nor health.  Look at menow and dare to tell me that I look forty-seven.""I wouldn't give a day over forty," Daylight confessed."Yet the day I came here I looked nearer sixty, and that was fifteenyears ago."They talked along, and Daylight looked at the world from new angles.Here was a man, neither bitter nor cynical, who laughed at thecity-dwellers and called them lunatics; a man who did not care formoney, and in whom the lust for power had long since died.  As for thefriendship of the city-dwellers, his host spoke in no uncertain terms."What did they do, all the chaps I knew, the chaps in the clubs withwhom I'd been cheek by jowl for heaven knows how long?  I was notbeholden to them for anything, and when I slipped out there was not oneof them to drop me a line and say, 'How are you, old man?  Anything Ican do for you?' For several weeks it was: 'What's become of Ferguson?'After that I became a reminiscence and a memory.  Yet every last one ofthem knew I had nothing but my salary and that I'd always lived a lapahead of it.""But what do you do now?" was Daylight's query.  "You must need cash tobuy clothes and magazines?""A week's work or a month's work, now and again, ploughing in thewinter, or picking grapes in the fall, and there's always odd jobs withthe farmers through the summer.  I don't need much, so I don't have towork much.  Most of my time I spend fooling around the place.  I coulddo hack work for the magazines and newspapers; but I prefer theploughing and the grape picking. Just look at me and you can see why.I'm hard as rocks.  And I like the work.  But I tell you a chap's gotto break in to it. It's a great thing when he's learned to pick grapesa whole long day and come home at the end of it with that tired happyfeeling, instead of being in a state of physical collapse.  Thatfireplace--those big stones--I was soft, then, a little, anemic,alcoholic degenerate, with the spunk of a rabbit and about one per centas much stamina, and some of those big stones nearly broke my back andmy heart.  But I persevered, and used my body in the way Natureintended it should be used--not bending over a desk and swillingwhiskey... and, well, here I am, a better man for it, and there's thefireplace, fine and dandy, eh?"And now tell me about the Klondike, and how you turned San Franciscoupside down with that last raid of yours.  You're a bonny fighter, youknow, and you touch my imagination, though my cooler reason tells methat you are a lunatic like the rest.  The lust for power! It's adreadful affliction.  Why didn't you stay in your Klondike?  Or whydon't you clear out and live a natural life, for instance, like mine?You see, I can ask questions, too.  Now you talk and let me listen fora while."It was not until ten o'clock that Daylight parted from Ferguson. As herode along through the starlight, the idea came to him of buying theranch on the other side of the valley.  There was no thought in hismind of ever intending to live on it.  His game was in San Francisco.But he liked the ranch, and as soon as he got back to the office hewould open up negotiations with Hillard. Besides, the ranch includedthe clay-pit, and it would give him the whip-hand over Holdsworthy ifhe ever tried to cut up any didoes.CHAPTER XThe time passed, and Daylight played on at the game.  But the game hadentered upon a new phase.  The lust for power in the mere gambling andwinning was metamorphosing into the lust for power in order to revenge.There were many men in San Francisco against whom he had registeredblack marks, and now and again, with one of his lightning strokes, heerased such a mark.  He asked no quarter; he gave no quarter.  Menfeared and hated him, and no one loved him, except Larry Hegan, hislawyer, who would have laid down his life for him.  But he was the onlyman with whom Daylight was really intimate, though he was on terms offriendliest camaraderie with the rough and unprincipled following ofthe bosses who ruled the Riverside Club.On the other hand, San Francisco's attitude toward Daylight hadundergone a change.  While he, with his slashing buccaneer methods, wasa distinct menace to the more orthodox financial gamblers, he wasnevertheless so grave a menace that they were glad enough to leave himalone.  He had already taught them the excellence of letting a sleepingdog lie.  Many of the men, who knew that they were in danger of his bigbear-paw when it reached out for the honey vats, even made efforts toplacate him, to get on the friendly side of him.  The Alta-Pacificapproached him confidentially with an offer of reinstatement, which hepromptly declined.  He was after a number of men in that club, and,whenever opportunity offered, he reached out for them and mangled them.Even the newspapers, with one or two blackmailing exceptions, ceasedabusing him and became respectful.  In short, he was looked upon as abald-faced grizzly from the Arctic wilds to whom it was consideredexpedient to give the trail.  At the time he raided the steamshipcompanies, they had yapped at him and worried him, the whole pack ofthem, only to have him whirl around and whip them in the fiercestpitched battle San Francisco had ever known.  Not easily forgotten wasthe Pacific Slope Seaman's strike and the giving over of the municipalgovernment to the labor bosses and grafters.  The destruction ofCharles Klinkner and the California and Altamont Trust Company had beena warning.  But it was an isolated case; they had been confident instrength in numbers--until he taught them better.Daylight still engaged in daring speculations, as, for instance, at theimpending outbreak of the Japanese-Russian War, when, in the face ofthe experience and power of the shipping gamblers, he reached out andclutched practically a monopoly of available steamer-charters.  Therewas scarcely a battered tramp on the Seven Seas that was not his ontime charter.  As usual, his position was, "You've got to come and seeme"; which they did, and, to use another of his phrases, they "paidthrough the nose" for the privilege.  And all his venturing andfighting had now but one motive.  Some day, as he confided to Hegan,when he'd made a sufficient stake, he was going back to New York andknock the spots out of Messrs. Dowsett, Letton, and Guggenhammer.  He'dshow them what an all-around general buzz-saw he was and what a mistakethey'd made ever to monkey with him.  But he never lost his head, andhe knew that he was not yet strong enough to go into death-grappleswith those three early enemies.  In the meantime the black marksagainst them remained for a future easement day.Dede Mason was still in the office.  He had made no more overtures,discussed no more books and no more grammar.  He had no active interestin her, and she was to him a pleasant memory of what had neverhappened, a joy, which, by his essential nature, he was barred fromever knowing.  Yet, while his interest had gone to sleep and his energywas consumed in the endless battles he waged, he knew every trick ofthe light on her hair, every quick denote mannerism of movement, everyline of her figure as expounded by her tailor-made gowns.  Severaltimes, six months or so apart, he had increased her salary, until nowshe was receiving ninety dollars a month.  Beyond this he dared not go,though he had got around it by making the work easier.  This he hadaccomplished after her return from a vacation, by retaining hersubstitute as an assistant.  Also, he had changed his office suite, sothat now the two girls had a room by themselves.His eye had become quite critical wherever Dede Mason was concerned.He had long since noted her pride of carriage.  It was unobtrusive, yetit was there.  He decided, from the way she carried it, that she deemedher body a thing to be proud of, to be cared for as a beautiful andvalued possession.  In this, and in the way she carried her clothes, hecompared her with her assistant, with the stenographers he encounteredin other offices, with the women he saw on the sidewalks.  "She's surewell put up," he communed with himself; "and she sure knows how todress and carry it off without being stuck on herself and withoutlaying it on thick."The more he saw of her, and the more he thought he knew of her, themore unapproachable did she seem to him.  But since he had no intentionof approaching her, this was anything but an unsatisfactory fact.  Hewas glad he had her in his office, and hoped she'd stay, and that wasabout all.Daylight did not improve with the passing years.  The life was not goodfor him.  He was growing stout and soft, and there was unwontedflabbiness in his muscles.  The more he drank cocktails, the more hewas compelled to drink in order to get the desired result, theinhibitions that eased him down from the concert pitch of hisoperations.  And with this went wine, too, at meals, and the longdrinks after dinner of Scotch and soda at the Riverside.  Then, too,his body suffered from lack of exercise; and, from lack of decent humanassociations, his moral fibres were weakening.  Never a man to hideanything, some of his escapades became public, such as speeding, and ofjoy-rides in his big red motor-car down to San Jose with companionsdistinctly sporty--incidents that were narrated as good fun andcomically in the newspapers.Nor was there anything to save him.  Religion had passed him by. "Along time dead" was his epitome of that phase of speculation. He wasnot interested in humanity.  According to his rough-hewn sociology, itwas all a gamble.  God was a whimsical, abstract, mad thing calledLuck.  As to how one happened to be born--whether a sucker or arobber--was a gamble to begin with; Luck dealt out the cards, and thelittle babies picked up the hands allotted them. Protest was vain.Those were their cards and they had to play them, willy-nilly,hunchbacked or straight backed, crippled or clean-limbed, addle-patedor clear-headed.  There was no fairness in it.  The cards most pickedup put them into the sucker class; the cards of a few enabled them tobecome robbers.  The playing of the cards was life--the crowd ofplayers, society.The table was the earth, and the earth, in lumps and chunks, fromloaves of bread to big red motor-cars, was the stake.  And in the end,lucky and unlucky, they were all a long time dead.It was hard on the stupid lowly, for they were coppered to lose fromthe start; but the more he saw of the others, the apparent winners, theless it seemed to him that they had anything to brag about.  They, too,were a long time dead, and their living did not amount to much.  It wasa wild animal fight; the strong trampled the weak, and the strong, hehad already discovered,--men like Dowsett, and Letton, andGuggenhammer,--were not necessarily the best.  He remembered his minercomrades of the Arctic.  They were the stupid lowly, they did the hardwork and were robbed of the fruit of their toil just as was the oldwoman making wine in the Sonoma hills; and yet they had finer qualitiesof truth, and loyalty, and square-dealing than did the men who robbedthem.  The winners seemed to be the crooked ones, the unfaithful ones,the wicked ones.  And even they had no say in the matter.  They playedthe cards that were given them; and Luck, the monstrous, mad-god thing,the owner of the whole shebang, looked on and grinned.  It was he whostacked the universal card-deck of existence.There was no justice in the deal.  The little men that came, the littlepulpy babies, were not even asked if they wanted to try a flutter atthe game.  They had no choice.  Luck jerked them into life, slammedthem up against the jostling table, and told them: "Now play, damn you,play!"  And they did their best, poor little devils.  The play of someled to steam yachts and mansions; of others, to the asylum or thepauper's ward.  Some played the one same card, over and over, and madewine all their days in the chaparral, hoping, at the end, to pull downa set of false teeth and a coffin.  Others quit the game early, havingdrawn cards that called for violent death, or famine in the Barrens, orloathsome and lingering disease.  The hands of some called for kingshipand irresponsible and numerated power; other hands called for ambition,for wealth in untold sums, for disgrace and shame, or for women andwine.As for himself, he had drawn a lucky hand, though he could not see allthe cards.  Somebody or something might get him yet.  The mad god,Luck, might be tricking him along to some such end.  An unfortunate setof circumstances, and in a month's time the robber gang might bewar-dancing around his financial carcass. This very day a street-carmight run him down, or a sign fall from a building and smash in hisskull.  Or there was disease, ever rampant, one of Luck's grimmestwhims.  Who could say? To-morrow, or some other day, a ptomaine bug, orsome other of a thousand bugs, might jump out upon him and drag himdown.  There was Doctor Bascom, Lee Bascom who had stood beside him aweek ago and talked and argued, a picture of magnificent youth, andstrength, and health.  And in three days he was dead--pneumonia,rheumatism of the heart, and heaven knew what else--at the endscreaming in agony that could be heard a block away.  That had beenterrible.  It was a fresh, raw stroke in Daylight's consciousness.  Andwhen would his own turn come?  Who could say?In the meantime there was nothing to do but play the cards he could seein his hand, and they were BATTLE, REVENGE, AND COCKTAILS.  And Lucksat over all and grinned.CHAPTER XIOne Sunday, late in the afternoon, found Daylight across the bay in thePiedmont hills back of Oakland.  As usual, he was in a big motor-car,though not his own, the guest of Swiftwater Bill, Luck's own darling,who had come down to spend the clean-up of the seventh fortune wrungfrom the frozen Arctic gravel.  A notorious spender, his latest pilewas already on the fair road to follow the previous six.  He it was, inthe first year of Dawson, who had cracked an ocean of champagne atfifty dollars a quart; who, with the bottom of his gold-sack in sight,had cornered the egg-market, at twenty-four dollars per dozen, to thetune of one hundred and ten dozen, in order to pique the lady-love whohad jilted him; and he it was, paying like a prince for speed, who hadchartered special trains and broken all records between San Franciscoand New York.  And here he was once more, the "luck-pup of hell," asDaylight called him, throwing his latest fortune away with the sameold-time facility.It was a merry party, and they had made a merry day of it, circling thebay from San Francisco around by San Jose and up to Oakland, havingbeen thrice arrested for speeding, the third time, however, on theHaywards stretch, running away with their captor.  Fearing that atelephone message to arrest them had been flashed ahead, they hadturned into the back-road through the hills, and now, rushing in uponOakland by a new route, were boisterously discussing what dispositionthey should make of the constable."We'll come out at Blair Park in ten minutes," one of the menannounced.  "Look here, Swiftwater, there's a crossroads right ahead,with lots of gates, but it'll take us backcountry clear into Berkeley.Then we can come back into Oakland from the other side, sneak across onthe ferry, and send the machine back around to-night with thechauffeur."But Swiftwater Bill failed to see why he should not go into Oakland byway of Blair Park, and so decided.The next moment, flying around a bend, the back-road they were notgoing to take appeared.  Inside the gate leaning out from her saddleand just closing it, was a young woman on a chestnut sorrel.  With hisfirst glimpse, Daylight felt there was something strangely familiarabout her.  The next moment, straightening up in the saddle with amovement he could not fail to identify, she put the horse into agallop, riding away with her back toward them.  It was Dede Mason--heremembered what Morrison had told him about her keeping a riding horse,and he was glad she had not seen him in this riotous company.Swiftwater Bill stood up, clinging with one hand to the back of thefront seat and waving the other to attract her attention. His lips werepursed for the piercing whistle for which he was famous and whichDaylight knew of old, when Daylight, with a hook of his leg and a yankon the shoulder, slammed the startled Bill down into his seat."You m-m-must know the lady," Swiftwater Bill spluttered."I sure do," Daylight answered, "so shut up.""Well, I congratulate your good taste, Daylight.  She's a peach, andshe rides like one, too."Intervening trees at that moment shut her from view, and SwiftwaterBill plunged into the problem of disposing of their constable, whileDaylight, leaning back with closed eyes, was still seeing Dede Masongallop off down the country road. Swiftwater Bill was right.  Shecertainly could ride.  And, sitting astride, her seat was perfect.Good for Dede!  That was an added point, her having the courage to ridein the only natural and logical manner.  Her head as screwed on right,that was one thing sure.On Monday morning, coming in for dictation, he looked at her with newinterest, though he gave no sign of it; and the stereotyped businesspassed off in the stereotyped way.  But the following Sunday found himon a horse himself, across the bay and riding through the Piedmonthills.  He made a long day of it, but no glimpse did he catch of DedeMason, though he even took the back-road of many gates and rode on intoBerkeley.  Here, along the lines of multitudinous houses, up one streetand down another, he wondered which of them might be occupied by her.Morrison had said long ago that she lived in Berkeley, and she had beenheaded that way in the late afternoon of the previous Sunday--evidentlyreturning home.It had been a fruitless day, so far as she was concerned; and yet notentirely fruitless, for he had enjoyed the open air and the horse underhim to such purpose that, on Monday, his instructions were out to thedealers to look for the best chestnut sorrel that money could buy.  Atodd times during the week he examined numbers of chestnut sorrels,tried several, and was unsatisfied. It was not till Saturday that hecame upon Bob.  Daylight knew him for what he wanted the moment he laideyes on him.  A large horse for a riding animal, he was none too largefor a big man like Daylight.  In splendid condition, Bob's coat in thesunlight was a flame of fire, his arched neck a jeweled conflagration."He's a sure winner," was Daylight's comment; but the dealer was not sosanguine.  He was selling the horse on commission, and its owner hadinsisted on Bob's true character being given.  The dealer gave it."Not what you'd call a real vicious horse, but a dangerous one. Full ofvinegar and all-round cussedness, but without malice. Just as soon killyou as not, but in a playful sort of way, you understand, withoutmeaning to at all.  Personally, I wouldn't think of riding him.  Buthe's a stayer.  Look at them lungs. And look at them legs.  Not ablemish.  He's never been hurt or worked.  Nobody ever succeeded intaking it out of him.  Mountain horse, too, trail-broke and all that,being raised in rough country.  Sure-footed as a goat, so long as hedon't get it into his head to cut up.  Don't shy.  Ain't really afraid,but makes believe.  Don't buck, but rears.  Got to ride him with amartingale.  Has a bad trick of whirling around without cause It's hisidea of a joke on his rider.  It's all just how he feels One day he'llride along peaceable and pleasant for twenty miles. Next day, beforeyou get started, he's well-nigh unmanageable. Knows automobiles so hecan lay down alongside of one and sleep or eat hay out of it.  He'lllet nineteen go by without batting an eye, and mebbe the twentieth,just because he's feeling frisky, he'll cut up over like a rangecayuse.  Generally speaking, too lively for a gentleman, and toounexpected. Present owner nicknamed him Judas Iscariot, and refuses tosell without the buyer knowing all about him first.  There, that'sabout all I know, except look at that mane and tail.  Ever see anythinglike it?  Hair as fine as a baby's."The dealer was right.  Daylight examined the mane and found it finerthan any horse's hair he had ever seen.  Also, its color was unusual inthat it was almost auburn.  While he ran his fingers through it, Bobturned his head and playfully nuzzled Daylight's shoulder."Saddle him up, and I'll try him," he told the dealer.  "I wonder ifhe's used to spurs.  No English saddle, mind.  Give me a good Mexicanand a curb bit--not too severe, seeing as he likes to rear."Daylight superintended the preparations, adjusting the curb strap andthe stirrup length, and doing the cinching.  He shook his head at themartingale, but yielded to the dealer's advice and allowed it to go on.And Bob, beyond spirited restlessness and a few playful attempts, gaveno trouble.  Nor in the hour's ride that followed, save for somepermissible curveting and prancing, did he misbehave.  Daylight wasdelighted; the purchase was immediately made; and Bob, with riding gearand personal equipment, was despatched across the bay forthwith to takeup his quarters in the stables of the Oakland Riding Academy.The next day being Sunday, Daylight was away early, crossing on theferry and taking with him Wolf, the leader of his sled team, the onedog which he had selected to bring with him when he left Alaska.  Questas he would through the Piedmont hills and along the many-gatedback-road to Berkeley, Daylight saw nothing of Dede Mason and herchestnut sorrel.  But he had little time for disappointment, for hisown chestnut sorrel kept him busy.  Bob proved a handful of impishnessand contrariety, and he tried out his rider as much as his rider triedhim out.  All of Daylight's horse knowledge and horse sense was calledinto play, while Bob, in turn, worked every trick in his lexicon.Discovering that his martingale had more slack in it than usual, heproceeded to give an exhibition of rearing and hind-leg walking.  Afterten hopeless minutes of it, Daylight slipped off and tightened themartingale, whereupon Bob gave an exhibition of angelic goodness.He fooled Daylight completely.  At the end of half an hour of goodness,Daylight, lured into confidence, was riding along at a walk and rollinga cigarette, with slack knees and relaxed seat, the reins lying on theanimal's neck.  Bob whirled abruptly and with lightning swiftness,pivoting on his hind legs, his fore legs just lifted clear of theground.  Daylight found himself with his right foot out of the stirrupand his arms around the animal's neck; and Bob took advantage of thesituation to bolt down the road.  With a hope that he should notencounter Dede Mason at that moment, Daylight regained his seat andchecked in the horse.Arrived back at the same spot, Bob whirled again.  This time Daylightkept his seat, but, beyond a futile rein across the neck, did nothingto prevent the evolution.  He noted that Bob whirled to the right, andresolved to keep him straightened out by a spur on the left.  But soabrupt and swift was the whirl that warning and accomplishment werepractically simultaneous."Well, Bob," he addressed the animal, at the same time wiping the sweatfrom his own eyes, "I'm free to confess that you're sure the blamedestall-fired quickest creature I ever saw.  I guess the way to fix you isto keep the spur just a-touching--ah! you brute!"For, the moment the spur touched him, his left hind leg had reachedforward in a kick that struck the stirrup a smart blow. Several times,out of curiosity, Daylight attempted the spur, and each time Bob's hooflanded the stirrup.  Then Daylight, following the horse's example ofthe unexpected, suddenly drove both spurs into him and reached himunderneath with the quirt."You ain't never had a real licking before," he muttered as Bob, thusrudely jerked out of the circle of his own impish mental processes,shot ahead.Half a dozen times spurs and quirt bit into him, and then Daylightsettled down to enjoy the mad magnificent gallop.  No longer punished,at the end of a half mile Bob eased down into a fast canter.  Wolf,toiling in the rear, was catching up, and everything was going nicely."I'll give you a few pointers on this whirling game, my boy," Daylightwas saying to him, when Bob whirled.He did it on a gallop, breaking the gallop off short by fore legsstiffly planted.  Daylight fetched up against his steed's neck withclasped arms, and at the same instant, with fore feet clear of theground, Bob whirled around.  Only an excellent rider could have escapedbeing unhorsed, and as it was, Daylight was nastily near to it.  By thetime he recovered his seat, Bob was in full career, bolting the way hehad come, and making Wolf side-jump to the bushes."All right, darn you!" Daylight grunted, driving in spurs and quirtagain and again.  "Back-track you want to go, and back-track you surewill go till you're dead sick of it."When, after a time, Bob attempted to ease down the mad pace, spurs andquirt went into him again with undiminished vim and put him to renewedeffort.  And when, at last, Daylight decided that the horse had hadenough, he turned him around abruptly and put him into a gentle canteron the forward track.  After a time he reined him in to a stop to seeif he were breathing painfully.Standing for a minute, Bob turned his head and nuzzled his rider'sstirrup in a roguish, impatient way, as much as to intimate that it wastime they were going on."Well, I'll be plumb gosh darned!" was Daylight's comment.  "Noill-will, no grudge, no nothing-and after that lambasting! You're surea hummer, Bob."Once again Daylight was lulled into fancied security.  For an hour Bobwas all that could be desired of a spirited mount, when, and as usualwithout warning, he took to whirling and bolting. Daylight put a stopto this with spurs and quirt, running him several punishing miles inthe direction of his bolt.  But when he turned him around and startedforward, Bob proceeded to feign fright at trees, cows, bushes, Wolf,his own shadow--in short, at every ridiculously conceivable object.  Atsuch times, Wolf lay down in the shade and looked on, while Daylightwrestled it out.So the day passed.  Among other things, Bob developed a trick of makingbelieve to whirl and not whirling.  This was as exasperating as thereal thing, for each time Daylight was fooled into tightening his leggrip and into a general muscular tensing of all his body.  And then,after a few make-believe attempts, Bob actually did whirl and caughtDaylight napping again and landed him in the old position with claspedarms around the neck.And to the end of the day, Bob continued to be up to one trick oranother; after passing a dozen automobiles on the way into Oakland,suddenly electing to go mad with fright at a most ordinary littlerunabout.  And just before he arrived back at the stable he capped theday with a combined whirling and rearing that broke the martingale andenabled him to gain a perpendicular position on his hind legs.  At thisjuncture a rotten stirrup leather parted, and Daylight was all butunhorsed.But he had taken a liking to the animal, and repented not of hisbargain.  He realized that Bob was not vicious nor mean, the troublebeing that he was bursting with high spirits and was endowed with morethan the average horse's intelligence.  It was the spirits and theintelligence, combined with inordinate roguishness, that made him whathe was.  What was required to control him was a strong hand, withtempered sternness and yet with the requisite touch of brutal dominance."It's you or me, Bob," Daylight told him more than once that day.And to the stableman, that night:--"My, but ain't he a looker! Ever see anything like him?  Best piece ofhorseflesh I ever straddled, and I've seen a few in my time."And to Bob, who had turned his head and was up to his playfulnuzzling:--"Good-by, you little bit of all right.  See you again next Sunday A.M.,and just you bring along your whole basket of tricks, you oldson-of-a-gun."CHAPTER XIIThroughout the week Daylight found himself almost as much interested inBob as in Dede; and, not being in the thick of any big deals, he wasprobably more interested in both of them than in the business game.Bob's trick of whirling was of especial moment to him.  How to overcomeit,--that was the thing.  Suppose he did meet with Dede out in thehills; and suppose, by some lucky stroke of fate, he should manage tobe riding alongside of her; then that whirl of Bob's would be mostdisconcerting and embarrassing.  He was not particularly anxious forher to see him thrown forward on Bob's neck.  On the other hand,suddenly to leave her and go dashing down the back-track, plying quirtand spurs, wouldn't do, either.What was wanted was a method wherewith to prevent that lightning whirl.He must stop the animal before it got around.  The reins would not dothis.  Neither would the spurs.  Remained the quirt.But how to accomplish it?  Absent-minded moments were many that week,when, sitting in his office chair, in fancy he was astride thewonderful chestnut sorrel and trying to prevent an anticipated whirl.One such moment, toward the end of the week, occurred in the middle ofa conference with Hegan.  Hegan, elaborating a new and dazzling legalvision, became aware that Daylight was not listening.  His eyes hadgone lack-lustre, and he, too, was seeing with inner vision."Got it" he cried suddenly.  "Hegan, congratulate me.  It's as simpleas rolling off a log.  All I've got to do is hit him on the nose, andhit him hard."Then he explained to the startled Hegan, and became a good listeneragain, though he could not refrain now and again from making audiblechuckles of satisfaction and delight.  That was the scheme.  Bob alwayswhirled to the right.  Very well.  He would double the quirt in hishand and, the instant of the whirl, that doubled quirt would rap Bob onthe nose.  The horse didn't live, after it had once learned the lesson,that would whirl in the face of the doubled quirt.More keenly than ever, during that week in the office did Daylightrealize that he had no social, nor even human contacts with Dede.  Thesituation was such that he could not ask her the simple questionwhether or not she was going riding next Sunday. It was a hardship of anew sort, this being the employer of a pretty girl.  He looked at heroften, when the routine work of the day was going on, the question hecould not ask her tickling at the founts of speech--Was she goingriding next Sunday?  And as he looked, he wondered how old she was, andwhat love passages she had had, must have had, with those collegewhippersnappers with whom, according to Morrison, she herded anddanced.  His mind was very full of her, those six days between theSundays, and one thing he came to know thoroughly well; he wanted her.And so much did he want her that his old timidity of the apron-stringwas put to rout.  He, who had run away from women most of his life, hadnow grown so courageous as to pursue.  Some Sunday, sooner or later, hewould meet her outside the office, somewhere in the hills, and then, ifthey did not get acquainted, it would be because she did not care toget acquainted.Thus he found another card in the hand the mad god had dealt him.How important that card was to become he did not dream, yet he decidedthat it was a pretty good card.  In turn, he doubted. Maybe it was atrick of Luck to bring calamity and disaster upon him.  Suppose Dedewouldn't have him, and suppose he went on loving her more and more,harder and harder?  All his old generalized terrors of love revived.He remembered the disastrous love affairs of men and women he had knownin the past.  There was Bertha Doolittle, old Doolittle's daughter, whohad been madly in love with Dartworthy, the rich Bonanza fractionowner; and Dartworthy, in turn, not loving Bertha at all, but madlyloving Colonel Walthstone's wife and eloping down the Yukon with her;and Colonel Walthstone himself, madly loving his own wife and lightingout in pursuit of the fleeing couple.  And what had been the outcome?Certainly Bertha's love had been unfortunate and tragic, and so had thelove of the other three. Down below Minook, Colonel Walthstone andDartworthy had fought it out.  Dartworthy had been killed.  A bulletthrough the Colonel's lungs had so weakened him that he died ofpneumonia the following spring.  And the Colonel's wife had no one leftalive on earth to love.And then there was Freda, drowning herself in the running mush-icebecause of some man on the other side of the world, and hating him,Daylight, because he had happened along and pulled her out of themush-ice and back to life.  And the Virgin.... The old memoriesfrightened him.  If this love-germ gripped him good and hard, and ifDede wouldn't have him, it might be almost as bad as being gouged outof all he had by Dowsett, Letton, and Guggenhammer.  Had his nascentdesire for Dede been less, he might well have been frightened out ofall thought of her.  As it was, he found consolation in the thoughtthat some love affairs did come out right.  And for all he knew, maybeLuck had stacked the cards for him to win.  Some men were born lucky,lived lucky all their days, and died lucky.  Perhaps, too, he was sucha man, a born luck-pup who could not lose.Sunday came, and Bob, out in the Piedmont hills, behaved like an angel.His goodness, at times, was of the spirited prancing order, butotherwise he was a lamb.  Daylight, with doubled quirt ready in hisright hand, ached for a whirl, just one whirl, which Bob, with anexcellence of conduct that was tantalizing, refused to perform.  But noDede did Daylight encounter.  He vainly circled about among the hillroads and in the afternoon took the steep grade over the divide of thesecond range and dropped into Maraga Valley.  Just after passing thefoot of the descent, he heard the hoof beats of a cantering horse.  Itwas from ahead and coming toward him.  What if it were Dede?  He turnedBob around and started to return at a walk.  If it were Dede, he wasborn to luck, he decided; for the meeting couldn't have occurred underbetter circumstances.  Here they were, both going in the samedirection, and the canter would bring her up to him just where thestiff grade would compel a walk.  There would be nothing else for herto do than ride with him to the top of the divide; and, once there, theequally stiff descent on the other side would compel more walking.The canter came nearer, but he faced straight ahead until he heard thehorse behind check to a walk.  Then he glanced over his shoulder.  Itwas Dede.  The recognition was quick, and, with her, accompanied bysurprise.  What more natural thing than that, partly turning his horse,he should wait till she caught up with him; and that, when abreast theyshould continue abreast on up the grade?  He could have sighed withrelief.  The thing was accomplished, and so easily.  Greetings had beenexchanged; here they were side by side and going in the same directionwith miles and miles ahead of them.He noted that her eye was first for the horse and next for him."Oh, what a beauty" she had cried at sight of Bob.  From the shininglight in her eyes, and the face filled with delight, he would scarcelyhave believed that it belonged to a young woman he had known in theoffice, the young woman with the controlled, subdued office face."I didn't know you rode," was one of her first remarks.  "I imaginedyou were wedded to get-there-quick machines.""I've just taken it up lately," was his answer.  "Beginning to getstout; you know, and had to take it off somehow."She gave a quick sidewise glance that embraced him from head to heel,including seat and saddle, and said:--"But you've ridden before."She certainly had an eye for horses and things connected with horseswas his thought, as he replied:--"Not for many years.  But I used to think I was a regular rip-snorterwhen I was a youngster up in Eastern Oregon, sneaking away from camp toride with the cattle and break cayuses and that sort of thing."Thus, and to his great relief, were they launched on a topic of mutualinterest.  He told her about Bob's tricks, and of the whirl and hisscheme to overcome it; and she agreed that horses had to be handledwith a certain rational severity, no matter how much one loved them.There was her Mab, which she had for eight years and which she had hadbreak of stall-kicking.  The process had been painful for Mab, but ithad cured her."You've ridden a lot," Daylight said."I really can't remember the first time I was on a horse," she toldhim.  "I was born on a ranch, you know, and they couldn't keep me awayfrom the horses.  I must have been born with the love for them.  I hadmy first pony, all my own, when I was six. When I was eight I knew whatit was to be all day in the saddle along with Daddy.  By the time I waseleven he was taking me on my first deer hunts.  I'd be lost without ahorse.  I hate indoors, and without Mab here I suppose I'd have beensick and dead long ago.""You like the country?" he queried, at the same moment catching hisfirst glimpse of a light in her eyes other than gray.  "As much as Idetest the city," she answered.  "But a woman can't earn a living inthe country.  So I make the best of it--along with Mab."And thereat she told him more of her ranch life in the days before herfather died.  And Daylight was hugely pleased with himself.  They weregetting acquainted.  The conversation had not lagged in the full halfhour they had been together."We come pretty close from the same part of the country," he said.  "Iwas raised in Eastern Oregon, and that's none so far from Siskiyou."The next moment he could have bitten out his tongue for her quickquestion was:--"How did you know I came from Siskiyou?  I'm sure I never mentioned it.""I don't know," he floundered temporarily.  "I heard somewhere that youwere from thereabouts."Wolf, sliding up at that moment, sleek-footed and like a shadow, causedher horse to shy and passed the awkwardness off, for they talkedAlaskan dogs until the conversation drifted back to horses.  And horsesit was, all up the grade and down the other side.When she talked, he listened and followed her, and yet all the while hewas following his own thoughts and impressions as well. It was a nervything for her to do, this riding astride, and he didn't know, afterall, whether he liked it or not.  His ideas of women were prone to beold-fashioned; they were the ones he had imbibed in the early-day,frontier life of his youth, when no woman was seen on anything but aside-saddle.  He had grown up to the tacit fiction that women onhorseback were not bipeds.  It came to him with a shock, this sight ofher so manlike in her saddle.  But he had to confess that the sightlooked good to him just then.Two other immediate things about her struck him.  First, there were thegolden spots in her eyes.  Queer that he had never noticed them before.Perhaps the light in the office had not been right, and perhaps theycame and went.  No; they were glows of color--a sort of diffused,golden light.  Nor was it golden, either, but it was nearer that thanany color he knew.  It certainly was not any shade of yellow.  Alover's thoughts are ever colored, and it is to be doubted if any oneelse in the world would have called Dede's eyes golden.  But Daylight'smood verged on the tender and melting, and he preferred to think ofthem as golden, and therefore they were golden.And then she was so natural.  He had been prepared to find her a mostdifficult young woman to get acquainted with.  Yet here it was provingso simple.  There was nothing highfalutin about her company manners--itwas by this homely phrase that he differentiated this Dede on horsebackfrom the Dede with the office manners whom he had always known.  Andyet, while he was delighted with the smoothness with which everythingwas going, and with the fact that they had found plenty to talk about,he was aware of an irk under it all.  After all, this talk was emptyand idle.  He was a man of action, and he wanted her, Dede Mason, thewoman; he wanted her to love him and to be loved by him; and he wantedall this glorious consummation then and there.  Used to forcing issuesused to gripping men and things and bending them to his will, he felt,now, the same compulsive prod of mastery. He wanted to tell her that heloved her and that there was nothing else for her to do but marry him.And yet he did not obey the prod.  Women were fluttery creatures, andhere mere mastery would prove a bungle.  He remembered all his huntingguile, the long patience of shooting meat in famine when a hit or amiss meant life or death.  Truly, though this girl did not yet meanquite that, nevertheless she meant much to him--more, now, than ever,as he rode beside her, glancing at her as often as he dared, she in hercorduroy riding-habit, so bravely manlike, yet so essentially andrevealingly woman, smiling, laughing, talking, her eyes sparkling, theflush of a day of sun and summer breeze warm in her cheeks.CHAPTER XIIIAnother Sunday man and horse and dog roved the Piedmont hills. Andagain Daylight and Dede rode together.  But this time her surprise atmeeting him was tinctured with suspicion; or rather, her surprise wasof another order.  The previous Sunday had been quite accidental, buthis appearing a second time among her favorite haunts hinted of morethan the fortuitous.  Daylight was made to feel that she suspected him,and he, remembering that he had seen a big rock quarry near Blair Park,stated offhand that he was thinking of buying it.  His one-timeinvestment in a brickyard had put the idea into his head--an idea thathe decided was a good one, for it enabled him to suggest that she ridealong with him to inspect the quarry.So several hours he spent in her company, in which she was much thesame girl as before, natural, unaffected, lighthearted, smiling andlaughing, a good fellow, talking horses with unflagging enthusiasm,making friends with the crusty-tempered Wolf, and expressing the desireto ride Bob, whom she declared she was more in love with than ever.  Atthis last Daylight demurred.  Bob was full of dangerous tricks, and hewouldn't trust any one on him except his worst enemy."You think, because I'm a girl, that I don't know anything abouthorses," she flashed back.  "But I've been thrown off and bucked offenough not to be over-confident.  And I'm not a fool. I wouldn't get ona bucking horse.  I've learned better.  And I'm not afraid of any otherkind.  And you say yourself that Bob doesn't buck.""But you've never seen him cutting up didoes," Daylight said."But you must remember I've seen a few others, and I've been on severalof them myself.  I brought Mab here to electric cars, locomotives, andautomobiles.  She was a raw range colt when she came to me.  Broken tosaddle that was all.  Besides, I won't hurt your horse."Against his better judgment, Daylight gave in, and, on an unfrequentedstretch of road, changed saddles and bridles."Remember, he's greased lightning," he warned, as he helped her tomount.She nodded, while Bob pricked up his ears to the knowledge that he hada strange rider on his back.  The fun came quickly enough--too quicklyfor Dede, who found herself against Bob's neck as he pivoted around andbolted the other way.  Daylight followed on her horse and watched.  Hesaw her check the animal quickly to a standstill, and immediately, withrein across neck and a decisive prod of the left spur, whirl him backthe way he had come and almost as swiftly."Get ready to give him the quirt on the nose," Daylight called.But, too quickly for her, Bob whirled again, though this time, by asevere effort, she saved herself from the undignified position againsthis neck.  His bolt was more determined, but she pulled him into aprancing walk, and turned him roughly back with her spurred heel.There was nothing feminine in the way she handled him; her method wasimperative and masculine.  Had this not been so, Daylight would haveexpected her to say she had had enough. But that little preliminaryexhibition had taught him something of Dede's quality.  And if it hadnot, a glance at her gray eyes, just perceptibly angry with herself,and at her firm-set mouth, would have told him the same thing.Daylight did not suggest anything, while he hung almost gleefully uponher actions in anticipation of what the fractious Bob was going to get.And Bob got it, on his next whirl, or attempt, rather, for he was nomore than halfway around when the quirt met him smack on his tendernose.  There and then, in his bewilderment, surprise, and pain, hisfore feet, just skimming above the road, dropped down."Great!" Daylight applauded.  "A couple more will fix him.  He's toosmart not to know when he's beaten."Again Bob tried.  But this time he was barely quarter around when thedoubled quirt on his nose compelled him to drop his fore feet to theroad.  Then, with neither rein nor spur, but by the mere threat of thequirt, she straightened him out.Dede looked triumphantly at Daylight."Let me give him a run?" she asked.Daylight nodded, and she shot down the road.  He watched her out ofsight around the bend, and watched till she came into sight returning.She certainly could sit her horse, was his thought, and she was a sureenough hummer.  God, she was the wife for a man!  Made most of themlook pretty slim.  And to think of her hammering all week at atypewriter.  That was no place for her. She should be a man's wife,taking it easy, with silks and satins and diamonds (his frontier notionof what befitted a wife beloved), and dogs, and horses, and suchthings--"And we'll see, Mr. Burning Daylight, what you and me can doabout it," he murmured to himself! and aloud to her:--"You'll do, Miss Mason; you'll do.  There's nothing too good inhorseflesh you don't deserve, a woman who can ride like that. No; staywith him, and we'll jog along to the quarry."  He chuckled.  "Say, heactually gave just the least mite of a groan that last time you fetchedhim.  Did you hear it?  And did you see the way he dropped his feet tothe road--just like he'd struck a stone wall.  And he's got savveeenough to know from now on that that same stone wall will be alwaysthere ready for him to lam into."When he parted from her that afternoon, at the gate of the road thatled to Berkeley, he drew off to the edge of the intervening clump oftrees, where, unobserved, he watched her out of sight. Then, turning toride back into Oakland, a thought came to him that made him grinruefully as he muttered: "And now it's up to me to make good and buythat blamed quarry.  Nothing less than that can give me an excuse forsnooping around these hills."But the quarry was doomed to pass out of his plans for a time, for onthe following Sunday he rode alone.  No Dede on a chestnut sorrel cameacross the back-road from Berkeley that day, nor the day a week later.Daylight was beside himself with impatience and apprehension, though inthe office he contained himself.  He noted no change in her, and stroveto let none show in himself. The same old monotonous routine went on,though now it was irritating and maddening.  Daylight found a bigquarrel on his hands with a world that wouldn't let a man behave towardhis stenographer after the way of all men and women.  What was the goodof owning millions anyway?  he demanded one day of the desk-calendar,as she passed out after receiving his dictation.As the third week drew to a close and another desolate Sundayconfronted him, Daylight resolved to speak, office or no office. And aswas his nature, he went simply and directly to the point She hadfinished her work with him, and was gathering her note pad and pencilstogether to depart, when he said:--"Oh, one thing more, Miss Mason, and I hope you won't mind my beingfrank and straight out.  You've struck me right along as asensible-minded girl, and I don't think you'll take offence at what I'mgoing to say.  You know how long you've been in the office--it's years,now, several of them, anyway; and you know I've always been straightand aboveboard with you.  I've never what you call--presumed.  Becauseyou were in my office I've tried to be more careful than if--if youwasn't in my office--you understand.  But just the same, it don't makeme any the less human.  I'm a lonely sort of a fellow--don't take thatas a bid for kindness.  What I mean by it is to try and tell you justhow much those two rides with you have meant.  And now I hope you won'tmind my just asking why you haven't been out riding the last twoSundays?"He came to a stop and waited, feeling very warm and awkward, theperspiration starting in tiny beads on his forehead.  She did not speakimmediately, and he stepped across the room and raised the windowhigher."I have been riding," she answered; "in other directions.""But why...?"  He failed somehow to complete the question.  "Go aheadand be frank with me," he urged.  "Just as frank as I am with you.  Whydidn't you ride in the Piedmont hills?  I hunted for you everywhere."And that is just why."  She smiled, and looked him straight in theeyes for a moment, then dropped her own.  "Surely, you understand, Mr.Harnish."He shook his head glumly."I do, and I don't.  I ain't used to city ways by a long shot. There'sthings one mustn't do, which I don't mind as long as I don't want to dothem.""But when you do?" she asked quickly."Then I do them." His lips had drawn firmly with this affirmation ofwill, but the next instant he was amending the statement "That is, Imostly do.  But what gets me is the things you mustn't do when they'renot wrong and they won't hurt anybody--this riding, for instance."She played nervously with a pencil for a time, as if debating herreply, while he waited patiently."This riding," she began; "it's not what they call the right thing. Ileave it to you.  You know the world.  You are Mr. Harnish, themillionaire--""Gambler," he broke in harshlyShe nodded acceptance of his term and went on."And I'm a stenographer in your office--""You're a thousand times better than me--" he attempted to interpolate,but was in turn interrupted."It isn't a question of such things.  It's a simple and fairly commonsituation that must be considered.  I work for you.  And it isn't whatyou or I might think, but what other persons will think.  And you don'tneed to be told any more about that.  You know yourself."Her cool, matter-of-fact speech belied her--or so Daylight thought,looking at her perturbed feminineness, at the rounded lines of herfigure, the breast that deeply rose and fell, and at the color that wasnow excited in her cheeks."I'm sorry I frightened you out of your favorite stamping ground," hesaid rather aimlessly."You didn't frighten me," she retorted, with a touch of fire. "I'm nota silly seminary girl.  I've taken care of myself for a long time now,and I've done it without being frightened.  We were together twoSundays, and I'm sure I wasn't frightened of Bob, or you.  It isn'tthat.  I have no fears of taking care of myself, but the world insistson taking care of one as well. That's the trouble.  It's what the worldwould have to say about me and my employer meeting regularly and ridingin the hills on Sundays.  It's funny, but it's so.  I could ride withone of the clerks without remark, but with you--no.""But the world don't know and don't need to know," he cried."Which makes it worse, in a way, feeling guilty of nothing and yetsneaking around back-roads with all the feeling of doing somethingwrong.  It would be finer and braver for me publicly...""To go to lunch with me on a week-day," Daylight said, divining thedrift of her uncompleted argument.She nodded."I didn't have that quite in mind, but it will do.  I'd prefer doingthe brazen thing and having everybody know it, to doing the furtivething and being found out.  Not that I'm asking to be invited tolunch," she added, with a smile; "but I'm sure you understand myposition.""Then why not ride open and aboveboard with me in the hills?" he urged.She shook her head with what he imagined was just the faintest hint ofregret, and he went suddenly and almost maddeningly hungry for her."Look here, Miss Mason, I know you don't like this talking over ofthings in the office.  Neither do I.  It's part of the whole thing, Iguess; a man ain't supposed to talk anything but business with hisstenographer.  Will you ride with me next Sunday, and we can talk itover thoroughly then and reach some sort of a conclusion.  Out in thehills is the place where you can talk something besides business.  Iguess you've seen enough of me to know I'm pretty square.  I--I dohonor and respect you, and ... and all that, and I..."  He wasbeginning to flounder, and the hand that rested on the desk blotter wasvisibly trembling. He strove to pull himself together.  "I just want toharder than anything ever in my life before.  I--I--I can't explainmyself, but I do, that's all.  Will you?--Just next Sunday?  To-morrow?"Nor did he dream that her low acquiescence was due, as much as anythingelse, to the beads of sweat on his forehead, his trembling hand, andhis all too-evident general distress.CHAPTER XIV"Of course, there's no way of telling what anybody wants from what theysay."   Daylight rubbed Bob's rebellious ear with his quirt andpondered with dissatisfaction the words he had just uttered.  They didnot say what he had meant them to say.  "What I'm driving at is thatyou say flatfooted that you won't meet me again, and you give yourreasons, but how am I to know they are your real reasons?  Mebbe youjust don't want to get acquainted with me, and won't say so for fear ofhurting my feelings.  Don't you see?  I'm the last man in the world toshove in where I'm not wanted.  And if I thought you didn't care awhoop to see anything more of me, why, I'd clear out so blamed quickyou couldn't see me for smoke."Dede smiled at him in acknowledgment of his words, but rode onsilently.  And that smile, he thought, was the most sweetly wonderfulsmile he had ever seen.  There was a difference in it, he assuredhimself, from any smile she had ever given him before.It was the smile of one who knew him just a little bit, of one who wasjust the least mite acquainted with him.  Of course, he checked himselfup the next moment, it was unconscious on her part.  It was sure tocome in the intercourse of any two persons.Any stranger, a business man, a clerk, anybody after a few casualmeetings would show similar signs of friendliness.  It was bound tohappen, but in her case it made more impression on him; and, besides,it was such a sweet and wonderful smile.  Other women he had known hadnever smiled like that; he was sure of it.It had been a happy day.  Daylight had met her on the back-road fromBerkeley, and they had had hours together.  It was only now, with theday drawing to a close and with them approaching the gate of the roadto Berkeley, that he had broached the important subject.She began her answer to his last contention, and he listened gratefully."But suppose, just suppose, that the reasons I have given are the onlyones?--that there is no question of my not wanting to know you?""Then I'd go on urging like Sam Scratch," he said quickly. "Because,you see, I've always noticed that folks that incline to anything aremuch more open to hearing the case stated.  But if you did have thatother reason up your sleeve, if you didn't want to know me, if--if,well, if you thought my feelings oughtn't to be hurt just because youhad a good job with me..."  Here, his calm consideration of apossibility was swamped by the fear that it was an actuality, and helost the thread of his reasoning. "Well, anyway, all you have to do isto say the word and I'll clear out."And with no hard feelings; it would be just a case of bad luck for me.So be honest, Miss Mason, please, and tell me if that's the reason--Ialmost got a hunch that it is."She glanced up at him, her eyes abruptly and slightly moist, half withhurt, half with anger."Oh, but that isn't fair," she cried.  "You give me the choice of lyingto you and hurting you in order to protect myself by getting rid ofyou, or of throwing away my protection by telling you the truth, forthen you, as you said yourself, would stay and urge."Her cheeks were flushed, her lips tremulous, but she continued to lookhim frankly in the eyes.Daylight smiled grimly with satisfaction."I'm real glad, Miss Mason, real glad for those words.""But they won't serve you," she went on hastily.  "They can't serveyou.  I refuse to let them.  This is our last ride, and... here is thegate."Ranging her mare alongside, she bent, slid the catch, and followed theopening gate."No; please, no," she said, as Daylight started to follow.Humbly acquiescent, he pulled Bob back, and the gate swung shut betweenthem.  But there was more to say, and she did not ride on."Listen, Miss Mason," he said, in a low voice that shook withsincerity; "I want to assure you of one thing.  I'm not just trying tofool around with you.  I like you, I want you, and I was never more inearnest in my life.  There's nothing wrong in my intentions or anythinglike that.  What I mean is strictly honorable--"But the expression of her face made him stop.  She was angry, and shewas laughing at the same time."The last thing you should have said," she cried.  "It's like a--amatrimonial bureau: intentions strictly honorable; object, matrimony.But it's no more than I deserved.  This is what I suppose you callurging like Sam Scratch."The tan had bleached out of Daylight's skin since the time he came tolive under city roofs, so that the flush of blood showed readily as itcrept up his neck past the collar and overspread his face.  Nor in hisexceeding discomfort did he dream that she was looking upon him at thatmoment with more kindness than at any time that day.  It was not in herexperience to behold big grown-up men who blushed like boys, andalready she repented the sharpness into which she had been surprised."Now, look here, Miss Mason," he began, slowly and stumblingly atfirst, but accelerating into a rapidity of utterance that was almostincoherent; "I'm a rough sort of a man, I know that, and I know I don'tknow much of anything.  I've never had any training in nice things.I've never made love before, and I've never been in love beforeeither--and I don't know how to go about it any more than a thunderingidiot.  What you want to do is get behind my tomfool words and get afeel of the man that's behind them. That's me, and I mean all right, ifI don't know how to go about it."Dede Mason had quick, birdlike ways, almost flitting from mood to mood;and she was all contrition on the instant."Forgive me for laughing," she said across the gate.  "It wasn't reallylaughter.  I was surprised off my guard, and hurt, too. You see, Mr.Harnish, I've not been..."She paused, in sudden fear of completing the thought into which herbirdlike precipitancy had betrayed her."What you mean is that you've not been used to such sort of proposing,"Daylight said; "a sort of on-the-run, 'Howdy,glad-to-make-your-acquaintance, won't-you-be-mine' proposition."She nodded and broke into laughter, in which he joined, and whichserved to pass the awkwardness away.  He gathered heart at this, andwent on in greater confidence, with cooler head and tongue."There, you see, you prove my case.  You've had experience in suchmatters.  I don't doubt you've had slathers of proposals. Well, Ihaven't, and I'm like a fish out of water.  Besides, this ain't aproposal.  It's a peculiar situation, that's all, and I'm in a corner.I've got enough plain horse-sense to know a man ain't supposed to arguemarriage with a girl as a reason for getting acquainted with her.  Andright there was where I was in the hole.  Number one, I can't getacquainted with you in the office.  Number two, you say you won't seeme out of the office to give me a chance.  Number three, your reason isthat folks will talk because you work for me.  Number four, I just gotto get acquainted with you, and I just got to get you to see that Imean fair and all right.  Number five, there you are on one side thegate getting ready to go, and me here on the other side the gate prettydesperate and bound to say something to make you reconsider.  Numbersix, I said it.  And now and finally, I just do want you to reconsider."And, listening to him, pleasuring in the sight of his earnest,perturbed face and in the simple, homely phrases that but emphasizedhis earnestness and marked the difference between him and the averagerun of men she had known, she forgot to listen and lost herself in herown thoughts.  The love of a strong man is ever a lure to a normalwoman, and never more strongly did Dede feel the lure than now, lookingacross the closed gate at Burning Daylight.  Not that she would everdream of marrying him--she had a score of reasons against it; but whynot at least see more of him?  He was certainly not repulsive to her.On the contrary, she liked him, had always liked him from the day shehad first seen him and looked upon his lean Indian face and into hisflashing Indian eyes.  He was a figure of a man in more ways than hismere magnificent muscles.  Besides, Romance had gilded him, thisdoughty, rough-hewn adventurer of the North, this man of many deeds andmany millions, who had come down out of the Arctic to wrestle and fightso masterfully with the men of the South.Savage as a Red Indian, gambler and profligate, a man without morals,whose vengeance was never glutted and who stamped on the faces of allwho opposed him--oh, yes, she knew all the hard names he had beencalled.  Yet she was not afraid of him.  There was more than that inthe connotation of his name.  Burning Daylight called up other thingsas well.  They were there in the newspapers, the magazines, and thebooks on the Klondike.  When all was said, Burning Daylight had amighty connotation--one to touch any woman's imagination, as it touchedhers, the gate between them, listening to the wistful and impassionedsimplicity of his speech.  Dede was after all a woman, with a woman'ssex-vanity, and it was this vanity that was pleased by the fact thatsuch a man turned in his need to her.And there was more that passed through her mind--sensations oftiredness and loneliness; trampling squadrons and shadowy armies ofvague feelings and vaguer prompting; and deeper and dimmer whisperingsand echoings, the flutterings of forgotten generations crystallizedinto being and fluttering anew and always, undreamed and unguessed,subtle and potent, the spirit and essence of life that under a thousanddeceits and masks forever makes for life.  It was a strong temptation,just to ride with this man in the hills.  It would be that only andnothing more, for she was firmly convinced that his way of life couldnever be her way.  On the other hand, she was vexed by none of theordinary feminine fears and timidities.  That she could take care ofherself under any and all circumstances she never doubted.  Then whynot?  It was such a little thing, after all.She led an ordinary, humdrum life at best.  She ate and slept andworked, and that was about all.  As if in review, her anchoriteexistence passed before her: six days of the week spent in the officeand in journeying back and forth on the ferry; the hours stolen beforebedtime for snatches of song at the piano, for doing her own speciallaundering, for sewing and mending and casting up of meagre accounts;the two evenings a week of social diversion she permitted herself; theother stolen hours and Saturday afternoons spent with her brother atthe hospital; and the seventh day, Sunday, her day of solace, on Mab'sback, out among the blessed hills.  But it was lonely, this solitaryriding.  Nobody of her acquaintance rode.  Several girls at theUniversity had been persuaded into trying it, but after a Sunday or twoon hired livery hacks they had lost interest.  There was Madeline, whobought her own horse and rode enthusiastically for several months, onlyto get married and go away to live in Southern California.  After yearsof it, one did get tired of this eternal riding alone.He was such a boy, this big giant of a millionaire who had half therich men of San Francisco afraid of him.  Such a boy!  She had neverimagined this side of his nature."How do folks get married?" he was saying.  "Why, number one, theymeet; number two, like each other's looks; number three, getacquainted; and number four, get married or not, according to how theylike each other after getting acquainted.  But how in thunder we're tohave a chance to find out whether we like each other enough is beyondmy savvee, unless we make that chance ourselves.  I'd come to see you,call on you, only I know you're just rooming or boarding, and thatwon't do."Suddenly, with a change of mood, the situation appeared to Dederidiculously absurd.  She felt a desire to laugh--not angrily, nothysterically, but just jolly.  It was so funny.  Herself, thestenographer, he, the notorious and powerful gambling millionaire, andthe gate between them across which poured his argument of peoplegetting acquainted and married.  Also, it was an impossible situation.On the face of it, she could not go on with it.  This program offurtive meetings in the hills would have to discontinue.  There wouldnever be another meeting.  And if, denied this, he tried to woo her inthe office, she would be compelled to lose a very good position, andthat would be an end of the episode.  It was not nice to contemplate;but the world of men, especially in the cities, she had not foundparticularly nice.  She had not worked for her living for years withoutlosing a great many of her illusions."We won't do any sneaking or hiding around about it," Daylight wasexplaining.  "We'll ride around as bold if you please, and if anybodysees us, why, let them.  If they talk--well, so long as our consciencesare straight we needn't worry.  Say the word, and Bob will have on hisback the happiest man alive."She shook her head, pulled in the mare, who was impatient to be off forhome, and glanced significantly at the lengthening shadows."It's getting late now, anyway," Daylight hurried on, "and we'vesettled nothing after all.  Just one more Sunday, anyway--that's notasking much--to settle it in.""We've had all day," she said."But we started to talk it over too late.  We'll tackle it earlier nexttime.  This is a big serious proposition with me, I can tell you.  Saynext Sunday?""Are men ever fair?" she asked.  "You know thoroughly well that by'next Sunday' you mean many Sundays.""Then let it be many Sundays," he cried recklessly, while she thoughtthat she had never seen him looking handsomer.  "Say the word.  Onlysay the word.  Next Sunday at the quarry..."She gathered the reins into her hand preliminary to starting."Good night," she said, "and--""Yes," he whispered, with just the faintest touch of impressiveness."Yes," she said, her voice low but distinct.At the same moment she put the mare into a canter and went down theroad without a backward glance, intent on an analysis of her ownfeelings.  With her mind made up to say no--and to the last instant shehad been so resolved--her lips nevertheless had said yes.  Or at leastit seemed the lips.  She had not intended to consent.  Then why hadshe?  Her first surprise and bewilderment at so wholly unpremeditatedan act gave way to consternation as she considered its consequences.She knew that Burning Daylight was not a man to be trifled with, thatunder his simplicity and boyishness he was essentially a dominant malecreature, and that she had pledged herself to a future of inevitablestress and storm.  And again she demanded of herself why she had saidyes at the very moment when it had been farthest from her intention.CHAPTER XVLife at the office went on much the way it had always gone. Never, byword or look, did they acknowledge that the situation was in any wisedifferent from what it had always been.  Each Sunday saw thearrangement made for the following Sunday's ride; nor was this everreferred to in the office.  Daylight was fastidiously chivalrous onthis point.  He did not want to lose her from the office.  The sight ofher at her work was to him an undiminishing joy.  Nor did he abuse thisby lingering over dictation or by devising extra work that would detainher longer before his eyes.  But over and beyond such sheer selfishnessof conduct was his love of fair play.  He scorned to utilize theaccidental advantages of the situation.  Somewhere within him was ahigher appeasement of love than mere possession.  He wanted to be lovedfor himself, with a fair field for both sides.On the other hand, had he been the most artful of schemers he could nothave pursued a wiser policy.  Bird-like in her love of individualfreedom, the last woman in the world to be bullied in her affections,she keenly appreciated the niceness of his attitude.  She did thisconsciously, but deeper than all consciousness, and intangible asgossamer, were the effects of this.  All unrealizable, save for somesupreme moment, did the web of Daylight's personality creep out andaround her.  Filament by filament, these secret and undreamable bondswere being established.  They it was that could have given the cue toher saying yes when she had meant to say no.  And in some such fashion,in some future crisis of greater moment, might she not, in violation ofall dictates of sober judgment, give another unintentional consent?Among other good things resulting from his growing intimacy with Dede,was Daylight's not caring to drink so much as formerly. There was alessening in desire for alcohol of which even he at last became aware.In a way she herself was the needed inhibition.  The thought of her waslike a cocktail.  Or, at any rate, she substituted for a certainpercentage of cocktails. From the strain of his unnatural cityexistence and of his intense gambling operations, he had drifted on tothe cocktail route.  A wall must forever be built to give him easementfrom the high pitch, and Dede became a part of this wall.  Herpersonality, her laughter, the intonations of her voice, the impossiblegolden glow of her eyes, the light on her hair, her form, her dress,her actions on horseback, her merest physical mannerisms--all, picturedover and over in his mind and dwelt upon, served to take the place ofmany a cocktail or long Scotch and soda.In spite of their high resolve, there was a very measurable degree ofthe furtive in their meetings.  In essence, these meetings were stolen.They did not ride out brazenly together in the face of the world.  Onthe contrary, they met always unobserved, she riding across themany-gated backroad from Berkeley to meet him halfway.  Nor did theyride on any save unfrequented roads, preferring to cross the secondrange of hills and travel among a church-going farmer folk who wouldscarcely have recognized even Daylight from his newspaper photographs.He found Dede a good horsewoman--good not merely in riding but inendurance.  There were days when they covered sixty, seventy, and eveneighty miles; nor did Dede ever claim any day too long, nor--anotherstrong recommendation to Daylight--did the hardest day ever theslightest chafe of the chestnut sorrel's back.  "A sure enough hummer,"was Daylight's stereotyped but ever enthusiastic verdict to himself.They learned much of each other on these long, uninterrupted rides.They had nothing much to talk about but themselves, and, while shereceived a liberal education concerning Arctic travel and gold-mining,he, in turn, touch by touch, painted an ever clearer portrait of her.She amplified the ranch life of her girlhood, prattling on about horsesand dogs and persons and things until it was as if he saw the wholeprocess of her growth and her becoming.  All this he was able to traceon through the period of her father's failure and death, when she hadbeen compelled to leave the university and go into office work.  Thebrother, too, she spoke of, and of her long struggle to have him curedand of her now fading hopes.  Daylight decided that it was easier tocome to an understanding of her than he had anticipated, though he wasalways aware that behind and under all he knew of her was themysterious and baffling woman and sex. There, he was humble enough toconfess to himself, was a chartless, shoreless sea, about which he knewnothing and which he must nevertheless somehow navigate.His lifelong fear of woman had originated out of non-understanding andhad also prevented him from reaching any understanding.  Dede onhorseback, Dede gathering poppies on a summer hillside, Dede takingdown dictation in her swift shorthand strokes--all this wascomprehensible to him.  But he did not know the Dede who so quicklychanged from mood to mood, the Dede who refused steadfastly to ridewith him and then suddenly consented, the Dede in whose eyes the goldenglow forever waxed and waned and whispered hints and messages that werenot for his ears.  In all such things he saw the glimmeringprofundities of sex, acknowledged their lure, and accepted them asincomprehensible.There was another side of her, too, of which he was consciouslyignorant.  She knew the books, was possessed of that mysterious andawful thing called "culture."  And yet, what continually surprised himwas that this culture was never obtruded on their intercourse.  She didnot talk books, nor art, nor similar folderols.  Homely minded as hewas himself, he found her almost equally homely minded.  She liked thesimple and the out-of-doors, the horses and the hills, the sunlight andthe flowers.  He found himself in a partly new flora, to which she wasthe guide, pointing out to him all the varieties of the oaks, makinghim acquainted with the madrono and the manzanita, teaching him thenames, habits, and habitats of unending series of wild flowers, shrubs,and ferns.  Her keen woods eye was another delight to him.  It had beentrained in the open, and little escaped it.  One day, as a test, theystrove to see which could discover the greater number of birds' nests.And he, who had always prided himself on his own acutely trainedobservation, found himself hard put to keep his score ahead.  At theend of the day he was but three nests in the lead, one of which shechallenged stoutly and of which even he confessed serious doubt. Hecomplimented her and told her that her success must be due to the factthat she was a bird herself, with all a bird's keen vision andquick-flashing ways.The more he knew her the more he became convinced of this birdlikequality in her.  That was why she liked to ride, he argued.  It was thenearest approach to flying.  A field of poppies, a glen of ferns, a rowof poplars on a country lane, the tawny brown of a hillside, the shaftof sunlight on a distant peak--all such were provocative of quick joyswhich seemed to him like so many outbursts of song.  Her joys were inlittle things, and she seemed always singing.  Even in sterner thingsit was the same.  When she rode Bob and fought with that magnificentbrute for mastery, the qualities of an eagle were uppermost in her.These quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him.  He joyedin her joy, his eyes as excitedly fixed on her as hers were fixed onthe object of her attention.  Also through her he came to a closerdiscernment and keener appreciation of nature. She showed him colors inthe landscape that he would never have dreamed were there.  He hadknown only the primary colors.  All colors of red were red.  Black wasblack, and brown was just plain brown until it became yellow, when itwas no longer brown. Purple he had always imagined was red, somethinglike blood, until she taught him better.  Once they rode out on a highhill brow where wind-blown poppies blazed about their horses' knees,and she was in an ecstasy over the lines of the many distances. Seven,she counted, and he, who had gazed on landscapes all his life, for thefirst time learned what a "distance" was.  After that, and always, helooked upon the face of nature with a more seeing eye, learning adelight of his own in surveying the serried ranks of the upstandingranges, and in slow contemplation of the purple summer mists thathaunted the languid creases of the distant hills.But through it all ran the golden thread of love.  At first he had beencontent just to ride with Dede and to be on comradely terms with her;but the desire and the need for her increased. The more he knew of her,the higher was his appraisal.  Had she been reserved and haughty withhim, or been merely a giggling, simpering creature of a woman, it wouldhave been different. Instead, she amazed him with her simplicity andwholesomeness, with her great store of comradeliness.  This latter wasthe unexpected.  He had never looked upon woman in that way.  Woman,the toy; woman, the harpy; woman, the necessary wife and mother of therace's offspring,--all this had been his expectation and understandingof woman.  But woman, the comrade and playfellow and joyfellow--thiswas what Dede had surprised him in.  And the more she became worthwhile, the more ardently his love burned, unconsciously shading hisvoice with caresses, and with equal unconsciousness flaring up signalfires in his eyes.  Nor was she blind to it yet, like many women beforeher, she thought to play with the pretty fire and escape the consequentconflagration."Winter will soon be coming on," she said regretfully, and withprovocation, one day, "and then there won't be any more riding.""But I must see you in the winter just the same," he cried hastily.She shook her head."We have been very happy and all that," she said, looking at him withsteady frankness.  "I remember your foolish argument for gettingacquainted, too; but it won't lead to anything; it can't. I know myselftoo well to be mistaken."Her face was serious, even solicitous with desire not to hurt, and hereyes were unwavering, but in them was the light, golden andglowing--the abyss of sex into which he was now unafraid to gaze."I've been pretty good," he declared.  "I leave it to you if I haven't.It's been pretty hard, too, I can tell you.  You just think it over.Not once have I said a word about love to you, and me loving you allthe time.  That's going some for a man that's used to having his ownway.  I'm somewhat of a rusher when it comes to travelling.  I reckonI'd rush God Almighty if it came to a race over the ice.  And yet Ididn't rush you.  I guess this fact is an indication of how much I dolove you.  Of course I want you to marry me.  Have I said a word aboutit, though? Nary a chirp, nary a flutter.  I've been quiet and good,though it's almost made me sick at times, this keeping quiet.  Ihaven't asked you to marry me.  I'm not asking you now.  Oh, not butwhat you satisfy me.  I sure know you're the wife for me.  But howabout myself?  Do you know me well enough know your own mind?" Heshrugged his shoulders.  "I don't know, and I ain't going to takechances on it now.  You've got to know for sure whether you think youcould get along with me or not, and I'm playing a slow conservativegame.  I ain't a-going to lose for overlooking my hand."This was love-making of a sort beyond Dede's experience.  Nor had sheever heard of anything like it.  Furthermore, its lack of ardor carriedwith it a shock which she could overcome only by remembering the wayhis hand had trembled in the past, and by remembering the passion shehad seen that very day and every day in his eyes, or heard in hisvoice.  Then, too, she recollected what he had said to her weeksbefore: "Maybe you don't know what patience is," he had said, andthereat told her of shooting squirrels with a big rifle the time he andElijah Davis had starved on the Stewart River."So you see," he urged, "just for a square deal we've got to see somemore of each other this winter.  Most likely your mind ain't made upyet--""But it is," she interrupted.  "I wouldn't dare permit myself to carefor you.  Happiness, for me, would not lie that way.  I like you, Mr.Harnish, and all that, but it can never be more than that.""It's because you don't like my way of living," he charged, thinking inhis own mind of the sensational joyrides and general profligacy withwhich the newspapers had credited him--thinking this, and wonderingwhether or not, in maiden modesty, she would disclaim knowledge of it.To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising."No; I don't.""I know I've been brash on some of those rides that got into thepapers," he began his defense, "and that I've been travelling with alively crowd.""I don't mean that," she said, "though I know about it too, and can'tsay that I like it.  But it is your life in general, your business.There are women in the world who could marry a man like you and behappy, but I couldn't.  And the more I cared for such a man, the moreunhappy I should be.  You see, my unhappiness, in turn, would tend tomake him unhappy.  I should make a mistake, and he would make an equalmistake, though his would not be so hard on him because he would stillhave his business.""Business!" Daylight gasped.  "What's wrong with my business?  I playfair and square.  There's nothing under hand about it, which can't besaid of most businesses, whether of the big corporations or of thecheating, lying, little corner-grocerymen.  I play the straight rulesof the game, and I don't have to lie or cheat or break my word."Dede hailed with relief the change in the conversation and at the sametime the opportunity to speak her mind."In ancient Greece," she began pedantically, "a man was judged a goodcitizen who built houses, planted trees--"  She did not complete thequotation, but drew the conclusion hurriedly.  "How many houses haveyou built?  How many trees have you planted?"He shook his head noncommittally, for he had not grasped the drift ofthe argument."Well," she went on, "two winters ago you cornered coal--""Just locally," he grinned reminiscently, "just locally.  And I tookadvantage of the car shortage and the strike in British Columbia.""But you didn't dig any of that coal yourself.  Yet you forced it upfour dollars a ton and made a lot of money.  That was your business.You made the poor people pay more for their coal.  You played fair, asyou said, but you put your hands down into all their pockets and tooktheir money away from them.  I know.  I burn a grate fire in mysitting-room at Berkeley.  And instead of eleven dollars a ton for RockWells, I paid fifteen dollars that winter.  You robbed me of fourdollars.  I could stand it.  But there were thousands of the very poorwho could not stand it. You might call it legal gambling, but to me itwas downright robbery."Daylight was not abashed.  This was no revelation to him.  Heremembered the old woman who made wine in the Sonoma hills and themillions like her who were made to be robbed."Now look here, Miss Mason, you've got me there slightly, I grant.  Butyou've seen me in business a long time now, and you know I don't make apractice of raiding the poor people.  I go after the big fellows.They're my meat.  They rob the poor, and I rob them.  That coal dealwas an accident.  I wasn't after the poor people in that, but after thebig fellows, and I got them, too.  The poor people happened to get inthe way and got hurt, that was all."Don't you see," he went on, "the whole game is a gamble. Everybodygambles in one way or another.  The farmer gambles against the weatherand the market on his crops.  So does the United States SteelCorporation.  The business of lots of men is straight robbery of thepoor people.  But I've never made that my business.  You know that.I've always gone after the robbers.""I missed my point," she admitted. "Wait a minute."And for a space they rode in silence."I see it more clearly than I can state it, but it's something likethis.  There is legitimate work, and there's work that--well, thatisn't legitimate.  The farmer works the soil and produces grain.  He'smaking something that is good for humanity.  He actually, in a way,creates something, the grain that will fill the mouths of the hungry.""And then the railroads and market-riggers and the rest proceed to robhim of that same grain,"--Daylight broke in Dede smiled and held up herhand."Wait a minute.  You'll make me lose my point.  It doesn't hurt if theyrob him of all of it so that he starves to death.  The point is thatthe wheat he grew is still in the world.  It exists.  Don't you see?The farmer created something, say ten tons of wheat, and those ten tonsexist.  The railroads haul the wheat to market, to the mouths that willeat it.  This also is legitimate.  It's like some one bringing you aglass of water, or taking a cinder out of your eye.  Something has beendone, in a way been created, just like the wheat.""But the railroads rob like Sam Scratch," Daylight objected."Then the work they do is partly legitimate and partly not.  Now wecome to you.  You don't create anything.  Nothing new exists whenyou're done with your business.  Just like the coal.  You didn't digit.  You didn't haul it to market.  You didn't deliver it.  Don't yousee?  that's what I meant by planting the trees and building thehouses.  You haven't planted one tree nor built a single house.""I never guessed there was a woman in the world who could talk businesslike that," he murmured admiringly.  "And you've got me on that point.But there's a lot to be said on my side just the same.  Now you listento me.  I'm going to talk under three heads.  Number one: We live ashort time, the best of us, and we're a long time dead.  Life is a biggambling game.  Some are born lucky and some are born unlucky.Everybody sits in at the table, and everybody tries to rob everybodyelse.  Most of them get robbed.  They're born suckers."Fellow like me comes along and sizes up the proposition.  I've got twochoices.  I can herd with the suckers, or I can herd with the robbers.As a sucker, I win nothing.  Even the crusts of bread are snatched outof my mouth by the robbers.  I work hard all my days, and die working.And I ain't never had a flutter.  I've had nothing but work, work,work.  They talk about the dignity of labor.  I tell you there ain't nodignity in that sort of labor. My other choice is to herd with therobbers, and I herd with them. I play that choice wide open to win.  Iget the automobiles, and the porterhouse steaks, and the soft beds."Number two: There ain't much difference between playing halfway robberlike the railroad hauling that farmer's wheat to market, and playingall robber and robbing the robbers like I do.  And, besides, halfwayrobbery is too slow a game for me to sit in. You don't win quick enoughfor me.""But what do you want to win for?" Dede demanded.  "You have millionsand millions, already.  You can't ride in more than one automobile at atime, sleep in more than one bed at a time.""Number three answers that," he said, "and here it is:  Men and thingsare so made that they have different likes.  A rabbit likes avegetarian diet.  A lynx likes meat.  Ducks swim; chickens are scairtof water.  One man collects postage stamps, another man collectsbutterflies.  This man goes in for paintings, that man goes in foryachts, and some other fellow for hunting big game.  One man thinkshorse-racing is It, with a big I, and another man finds the biggestsatisfaction in actresses. They can't help these likes.  They havethem, and what are they going to do about it?  Now I like gambling.  Ilike to play the game.  I want to play it big and play it quick.  I'mjust made that way.  And I play it.""But why can't you do good with all your money?"Daylight laughed."Doing good with your money!  It's like slapping God in the face, asmuch as to tell him that he don't know how to run his world and thatyou'll be much obliged if he'll stand out of the way and give you achance.  Thinking about God doesn't keep me sitting up nights, so I'vegot another way of looking at it.  Ain't it funny, to go around withbrass knuckles and a big club breaking folks' heads and taking theirmoney away from them until I've got a pile, and then, repenting of myways, going around and bandaging up the heads the other robbers arebreaking?  I leave it to you.  That's what doing good with moneyamounts to.  Every once in a while some robber turns soft-hearted andtakes to driving an ambulance.  That's what Carnegie did.  He smashedheads in pitched battles at Homestead, regular wholesale head-breakerhe was, held up the suckers for a few hundred million, and now he goesaround dribbling it back to them.  Funny?  I leave it to you."He rolled a cigarette and watched her half curiously, half amusedly.His replies and harsh generalizations of a harsh school weredisconcerting, and she came back to her earlier position."I can't argue with you, and you know that.  No matter how right awoman is, men have such a way about them well, what they say soundsmost convincing, and yet the woman is still certain they are wrong.But there is one thing--the creative joy.  Call it gambling if youwill, but just the same it seems to me more satisfying to createsomething, make something, than just to roll dice out of a dice-box allday long.  Why, sometimes, for exercise, or when I've got to payfifteen dollars for coal, I curry Mab and give her a whole half hour'sbrushing.  And when I see her coat clean and shining and satiny, I feela satisfaction in what I've done.  So it must be with the man whobuilds a house or plants a tree.  He can look at it.  He made it.  It'shis handiwork.  Even if somebody like you comes along and takes histree away from him, still it is there, and still did he make it. Youcan't rob him of that, Mr. Harnish, with all your millions. It's thecreative joy, and it's a higher joy than mere gambling. Haven't youever made things yourself--a log cabin up in the Yukon, or a canoe, orraft, or something?  And don't you remember how satisfied you were, howgood you felt, while you were doing it and after you had it done?"While she spoke his memory was busy with the associations she recalled.He saw the deserted flat on the river bank by the Klondike, and he sawthe log cabins and warehouses spring up, and all the log structures hehad built, and his sawmills working night and day on three shifts."Why, dog-gone it, Miss Mason, you're right--in a way.  I've builthundreds of houses up there, and I remember I was proud and glad to seethem go up.  I'm proud now, when I remember them. And there wasOphir--the most God-forsaken moose-pasture of a creek you ever laideyes on.  I made that into the big Ophir. Why, I ran the water in therefrom the Rinkabilly, eighty miles away.  They all said I couldn't, butI did it, and I did it by myself.  The dam and the flume cost me fourmillion.  But you should have seen that Ophir--power plants, electriclights, and hundreds of men on the pay-roll, working night and day.  Iguess I do get an inkling of what you mean by making a thing.  I madeOphir, and by God, she was a sure hummer--I beg your pardon.  I didn'tmean to cuss.  But that Ophir!--I sure am proud of her now, just as thelast time I laid eyes on her.""And you won something there that was more than mere money," Dedeencouraged.  "Now do you know what I would do if I had lots of moneyand simply had to go on playing at business?  Take all the southerlyand westerly slopes of these bare hills.  I'd buy them in and planteucalyptus on them.  I'd do it for the joy of doing it anyway; butsuppose I had that gambling twist in me which you talk about, why, I'ddo it just the same and make money out of the trees.  And there's myother point again.  Instead of raising the price of coal without addingan ounce of coal to the market supply, I'd be making thousands andthousands of cords of firewood--making something where nothing wasbefore.  And everybody who ever crossed on the ferries would look up atthese forested hills and be made glad.  Who was made glad by youradding four dollars a ton to Rock Wells?"It was Daylight's turn to be silent for a time while she waited ananswer."Would you rather I did things like that?" he asked at last."It would be better for the world, and better for you," she answerednoncommittally.CHAPTER XVIAll week every one in the office knew that something new and big wasafoot in Daylight's mind.  Beyond some deals of no importance, he hadnot been interested in anything for several months.  But now he wentabout in an almost unbroken brown study, made unexpected and lengthytrips across the bay to Oakland, or sat at his desk silent andmotionless for hours.  He seemed particularly happy with what occupiedhis mind.  At times men came in and conferred with him--and with newfaces and differing in type from those that usually came to see him.On Sunday Dede learned all about it.  "I've been thinking a lot of ourtalk," he began, "and I've got an idea I'd like to give it a flutter.And I've got a proposition to make your hair stand up.  It's what youcall legitimate, and at the same time it's the gosh-dangdest gamble aman ever went into.  How about planting minutes wholesale, and makingtwo minutes grow where one minute grew before?  Oh, yes, and planting afew trees, too--say several million of them.  You remember the quarry Imade believe I was looking at?  Well, I'm going to buy it.  I'm goingto buy these hills, too, clear from here around to Berkeley and downthe other way to San Leandro.  I own a lot of them already, for thatmatter.  But mum is the word.  I'll be buying a long time to comebefore anything much is guessed about it, and I don't want the marketto jump up out of sight.  You see that hill over there. It's my hillrunning clear down its slopes through Piedmont and halfway along thoserolling hills into Oakland.  And it's nothing to all the things I'mgoing to buy."He paused triumphantly.  "And all to make two minutes grow where onegrew before?" Dede queried, at the same time laughing heartily at hisaffectation of mystery.He stared at her fascinated.  She had such a frank, boyish way ofthrowing her head back when she laughed.  And her teeth were anunending delight to him.  Not small, yet regular and firm, without ablemish, he considered them the healthiest, whitest, prettiest teeth hehad ever seen.  And for months he had been comparing them with theteeth of every woman he met.It was not until her laughter was over that he was able to continue."The ferry system between Oakland and San Francisco is the worstone-horse concern in the United States.  You cross on it every day, sixdays in the week.  That's say, twenty-five days a month, or threehundred a year.  How long does it take you one way? Forty minutes, ifyou're lucky.  I'm going to put you across in twenty minutes.  If thatain't making two minutes grow where one grew before, knock off my headwith little apples.  I'll save you twenty minutes each way.  That'sforty minutes a day, times three hundred, equals twelve thousandminutes a year, just for you, just for one person.  Let's see: that'stwo hundred whole hours. Suppose I save two hundred hours a year forthousands of other folks,--that's farming some, ain't it?"Dede could only nod breathlessly.  She had caught the contagion of hisenthusiasm, though she had no clew as to how this great time-saving wasto be accomplished."Come on," he said.  "Let's ride up that hill, and when I get you outon top where you can see something, I'll talk sense."A small footpath dropped down to the dry bed of the canon, which theycrossed before they began the climb.  The slope was steep and coveredwith matted brush and bushes, through which the horses slipped andlunged.  Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted topass Mab.  The mare was thrust sidewise into the denser bush, where shenearly fell.  Recovering, she flung her weight against Bob.  Bothriders' legs were caught in the consequent squeeze, and, as Bob plungedahead down hill, Dede was nearly scraped off.  Daylight threw his horseon to its haunches and at the same time dragged Dede back into thesaddle. Showers of twigs and leaves fell upon them, and predicamentfollowed predicament, until they emerged on the hilltop the worse forwear but happy and excited.  Here no trees obstructed the view.  Theparticular hill on which they were, out-jutted from the regular line ofthe range, so that the sweep of their vision extended overthree-quarters of the circle.  Below, on the flat land bordering thebay, lay Oakland, and across the bay was San Francisco.  Between thetwo cities they could see the white ferry-boats on the water.  Aroundto their right was Berkeley, and to their left the scattered villagesbetween Oakland and San Leandro.  Directly in the foreground wasPiedmont, with its desultory dwellings and patches of farming land, andfrom Piedmont the land rolled down in successive waves upon Oakland."Look at it," said Daylight, extending his arm in a sweeping gesture."A hundred thousand people there, and no reason there shouldn't be halfa million.  There's the chance to make five people grow where one growsnow.  Here's the scheme in a nutshell.  Why don't more people live inOakland?  No good service with San Francisco, and, besides, Oakland isasleep. It's a whole lot better place to live in than San Francisco.Now, suppose I buy in all the street railways of Oakland, Berkeley,Alameda, San Leandro, and the rest,--bring them under one head with acompetent management?  Suppose I cut the time to San Francisco one-halfby building a big pier out there almost to Goat Island and establishinga ferry system with modern up-to-date boats?  Why, folks will want tolive over on this side.  Very good.  They'll need land on which tobuild.  So, first I buy up the land.  But the land's cheap now.  Why?Because it's in the country, no electric roads, no quick communication,nobody guessing that the electric roads are coming.  I'll build theroads. That will make the land jump up.  Then I'll sell the land asfast as the folks will want to buy because of the improved ferry systemand transportation facilities."You see, I give the value to the land by building the roads. Then Isell the land and get that value back, and after that, there's theroads, all carrying folks back and forth and earning big money.  Can'tlose.  And there's all sorts of millions in it."I'm going to get my hands on some of that water front and thetide-lands.  Take between where I'm going to build my pier and the oldpier.  It's shallow water.  I can fill and dredge and put in a systemof docks that will handle hundreds of ships.  San Francisco's waterfront is congested.  No more room for ships. With hundreds of shipsloading and unloading on this side right into the freight cars of threebig railroads, factories will start up over here instead of crossing toSan Francisco.  That means factory sites.  That means me buying in thefactory sites before anybody guesses the cat is going to jump, muchless, which way.  Factories mean tens of thousands of workingmen andtheir families.  That means more houses and more land, and that meansme, for I'll be there to sell them the land.  And tens of thousands offamilies means tens of thousands of nickels every day for my electriccars.  The growing population will mean more stores, more banks, moreeverything.  And that'll mean me, for I'll be right there with businessproperty as well as home property.  What do you think of it?"Before she could answer, he was off again, his mind's eye filledwith this new city of his dream which he builded on the Alameda hillsby the gateway to the Orient."Do you know--I've been looking it up--the Firth Of Clyde, where allthe steel ships are built, isn't half as wide as Oakland Creek downthere, where all those old hulks lie?  Why ain't it a Firth of Clyde?Because the Oakland City Council spends its time debating about prunesand raisins.  What is needed is somebody to see things, and, afterthat, organization.  That's me.  I didn't make Ophir for nothing.  Andonce things begin to hum, outside capital will pour in.  All I do isstart it going.  'Gentlemen,' I say, 'here's all the natural advantagesfor a great metropolis. God Almighty put them advantages here, and heput me here to see them.  Do you want to land your tea and silk fromAsia and ship it straight East?  Here's the docks for your steamers,and here's the railroads.  Do you want factories from which you canship direct by land or water?  Here's the site, and here's the modern,up-to-date city, with the latest improvements for yourselves and yourworkmen, to live in.'""Then there's the water.  I'll come pretty close to owning thewatershed.  Why not the waterworks too?  There's two water companies inOakland now, fighting like cats and dogs and both about broke.  What ametropolis needs is a good water system. They can't give it.  They'restick-in-the-muds.  I'll gobble them up and deliver the right articleto the city.  There's money there, too--money everywhere.  Everythingworks in with everything else.  Each improvement makes the value ofeverything else pump up.  It's people that are behind the value.  Thebigger the crowd that herds in one place, the more valuable is the realestate.  And this is the very place for a crowd to herd.  Look at it.Just look at it!  You could never find a finer site for a great city.All it needs is the herd, and I'll stampede a couple of hundredthousand people in here inside two years.  And what's more it won't beone of these wild cat land booms.  It will be legitimate.  Twenty yearsfrom now there'll be a million people on this side the bay.  Anotherthing is hotels.  There isn't a decent one in the town.  I'll build acouple of up-to-date ones that'll make them sit up and take notice.  Iwon't care if they don't pay for years.  Their effect will more thangive me my money back out of the other holdings.  And, oh, yes, I'mgoing to plant eucalyptus, millions of them, on these hills.""But how are you going to do it?" Dede asked.  "You haven't enoughmoney for all that you've planned.""I've thirty million, and if I need more I can borrow on the land andother things.  Interest on mortgages won't anywhere near eat up theincrease in land values, and I'll be selling land right along."In the weeks that followed, Daylight was a busy man.  He spent most ofhis time in Oakland, rarely coming to the office.  He planned to movethe office to Oakland, but, as he told Dede, the secret preliminarycampaign of buying had to be put through first.  Sunday by Sunday, nowfrom this hilltop and now from that, they looked down upon the city andits farming suburbs, and he pointed out to her his latest acquisitions.At first it was patches and sections of land here and there; but as theweeks passed it was the unowned portions that became rare, until atlast they stood as islands surrounded by Daylight's land.It meant quick work on a colossal scale, for Oakland and the adjacentcountry was not slow to feel the tremendous buying.  But Daylight hadthe ready cash, and it had always been his policy to strike quickly.Before the others could get the warning of the boom, he quietlyaccomplished many things.  At the same time that his agents werepurchasing corner lots and entire blocks in the heart of the businesssection and the waste lands for factory sites, he was rushingfranchises through the city council, capturing the two exhausted watercompanies and the eight or nine independent street railways, andgetting his grip on the Oakland Creek and the bay tide-lands for hisdock system.  The tide-lands had been in litigation for years, and hetook the bull by the horns--buying out the private owners and at thesame time leasing from the city fathers.By the time that Oakland was aroused by this unprecedented activity inevery direction and was questioning excitedly the meaning of it,Daylight secretly bought the chief Republican newspaper and the chiefDemocratic organ, and moved boldly into his new offices.  Of necessity,they were on a large scale, occupying four floors of the only modernoffice building in the town--the only building that wouldn't have to betorn down later on, as Daylight put it.  There was department afterdepartment, a score of them, and hundreds of clerks and stenographers.As he told Dede: "I've got more companies than you can shake a stickat.  There's the Alameda & Contra Costa Land Syndicate, theConsolidated Street Railways, the Yerba Buena Ferry Company, the UnitedWater Company, the Piedmont Realty Company, the Fairview and PortolaHotel Company, and half a dozen more that I've got to refer to anotebook to remember.  There's the Piedmont Laundry Farm, and RedwoodConsolidated Quarries.  Starting in with our quarry, I just kepta-going till I got them all.  And there's the ship-building company Iain't got a name for yet.  Seeing as I had to have ferry-boats, Idecided to build them myself.  They'll be done by the time the pier isready for them.  Phew!  It all sure beats poker.  And I've had the funof gouging the robber gangs as well.  The water company bunches aresquealing yet.  I sure got them where the hair was short.  They werejust about all in when I came along and finished them off.""But why do you hate them so?" Dede asked."Because they're such cowardly skunks.""But you play the same game they do.""Yes; but not in the same way."  Daylight regarded her thoughtfully."When I say cowardly skunks, I mean just that,--cowardly skunks.  Theyset up for a lot of gamblers, and there ain't one in a thousand of themthat's got the nerve to be a gambler.  They're four-flushers, if youknow what that means. They're a lot of little cottontail rabbits makingbelieve they're big rip-snorting timber wolves.  They set out toeverlastingly eat up some proposition but at the first sign of troublethey turn tail and stampede for the brush.  Look how it works.  Whenthe big fellows wanted to unload Little Copper, they sent Jakey Fallowinto the New York Stock Exchange to yell out: 'I'll buy all or any partof Little Copper at fifty five,' Little Copper being at fifty-four.And in thirty minutes them cottontails--financiers, some folks callthem--bid up Little Copper to sixty. And an hour after that, stampedingfor the brush, they were throwing Little Copper overboard at forty-fiveand even forty."They're catspaws for the big fellows.  Almost as fast as they rob thesuckers, the big fellows come along and hold them up.  Or else the bigfellows use them in order to rob each other.  That's the way theChattanooga Coal and Iron Company was swallowed up by the trust in thelast panic.  The trust made that panic.  It had to break a couple ofbig banking companies and squeeze half a dozen big fellows, too, and itdid it by stampeding the cottontails.  The cottontails did the rest allright, and the trust gathered in Chattanooga Coal and Iron.  Why, anyman, with nerve and savvee, can start them cottontails jumping for thebrush.  I don't exactly hate them myself, but I haven't any regard forchicken-hearted four-flushers."CHAPTER XVIIFor months Daylight was buried in work.  The outlay was terrific, andthere was nothing coming in.  Beyond a general rise in land values,Oakland had not acknowledged his irruption on the financial scene.  Thecity was waiting for him to show what he was going to do, and he lostno time about it.  The best skilled brains on the market were hired byhim for the different branches of the work.  Initial mistakes he had nopatience with, and he was determined to start right, as when he engagedWilkinson, almost doubling his big salary, and brought him out fromChicago to take charge of the street railway organization.  Night andday the road gangs toiled on the streets.  And night and day thepile-drivers hammered the big piles down into the mud of San FranciscoBay.  The pier was to be three miles long, and the Berkeley hills weredenuded of whole groves of mature eucalyptus for the piling.At the same time that his electric roads were building out through thehills, the hay-fields were being surveyed and broken up into citysquares, with here and there, according to best modern methods, windingboulevards and strips of park.  Broad streets, well graded, were made,with sewers and water-pipes ready laid, and macadamized from his ownquarries.  Cement sidewalks were also laid, so that all the purchaserhad to do was to select his lot and architect and start building.  Thequick service of Daylight's new electric roads into Oakland made thisbig district immediately accessible, and long before the ferry systemwas in operation hundreds of residences were going up.The profit on this land was enormous.  In a day, his onslaught ofwealth had turned open farming country into one of the best residentialdistricts of the city.But this money that flowed in upon him was immediately poured back intohis other investments.  The need for electric cars was so great that heinstalled his own shops for building them.  And even on the rising landmarket, he continued to buy choice factory sites and buildingproperties.  On the advice of Wilkinson, practically every electricroad already in operation was rebuilt.  The light, old fashioned railswere torn out and replaced by the heaviest that were manufactured.Corner lots, on the sharp turns of narrow streets, were bought andruthlessly presented to the city in order to make wide curves for histracks and high speed for his cars.  Then, too, there were themain-line feeders for his ferry system, tapping every portion ofOakland, Alameda, and Berkeley, and running fast expresses to the pierend.  The same large-scale methods were employed in the water system.Service of the best was needed, if his huge land investment was tosucceed.  Oakland had to be made into a worth-while city, and that waswhat he intended to do.  In addition to his big hotels, he builtamusement parks for the common people, and art galleries and club-housecountry inns for the more finicky classes.  Even before there was anyincrease in population, a marked increase in street-railway traffictook place.  There was nothing fanciful about his schemes.  They weresound investments."What Oakland wants is a first class theatre," he said, and, aftervainly trying to interest local capital, he started the building of thetheatre himself; for he alone had vision for the two hundred thousandnew people that were coming to the town.But no matter what pressure was on Daylight, his Sundays he reservedfor his riding in the hills.  It was not the winter weather, however,that brought these rides with Dede to an end. One Saturday afternoon inthe office she told him not to expect to meet her next day, and, whenhe pressed for an explanation:"I've sold Mab."Daylight was speechless for the moment.  Her act meant one of so manyserious things that he couldn't classify it.  It smacked almost oftreachery.  She might have met with financial disaster.It might be her way of letting him know she had seen enough of him.Or..."What's the matter?" he managed to ask."I couldn't afford to keep her with hay forty-five dollars a ton," Dedeanswered."Was that your only reason?" he demanded, looking at her steadily; forhe remembered her once telling him how she had brought the mare throughone winter, five years before, when hay had gone as high as sixtydollars a ton."No.  My brother's expenses have been higher, as well, and I was drivento the conclusion that since I could not afford both, I'd better letthe mare go and keep the brother."Daylight felt inexpressibly saddened.  He was suddenly aware of a greatemptiness.  What would a Sunday be without Dede?  And Sundays withoutend without her?  He drummed perplexedly on the desk with his fingers."Who bought her?" he asked.  Dede's eyes flashed in the way long sincefamiliar to him when she was angry."Don't you dare buy her back for me," she cried.  "And don't deny thatthat was what you had in mind.""I won't deny it.  It was my idea to a tee.  But I wouldn't have doneit without asking you first, and seeing how you feel about it, I won'teven ask you.  But you thought a heap of that mare, and it's prettyhard on you to lose her.  I'm sure sorry.  And I'm sorry, too, that youwon't be riding with me tomorrow.  I'll be plumb lost.  I won't knowwhat to do with myself.""Neither shall I," Dede confessed mournfully, "except that I shall beable to catch up with my sewing.""But I haven't any sewing."Daylight's tone was whimsically plaintive, but secretly he wasdelighted with her confession of loneliness.  It was almost worth theloss of the mare to get that out of her.  At any rate, he meantsomething to her.  He was not utterly unliked."I wish you would reconsider, Miss Mason," he said softly.  "Not alonefor the mare's sake, but for my sake.  Money don't cut any ice in this.For me to buy that mare wouldn't mean as it does to most men to send abouquet of flowers or a box of candy to a young lady.  And I've neversent you flowers or candy."  He observed the warning flash of her eyes,and hurried on to escape refusal.  "I'll tell you what we'll do.Suppose I buy the mare and own her myself, and lend her to you when youwant to ride. There's nothing wrong in that.  Anybody borrows a horsefrom anybody, you know."Agin he saw refusal, and headed her off."Lots of men take women buggy-riding.  There's nothing wrong in that.And the man always furnishes the horse and buggy. Well, now, what's thedifference between my taking you buggy-riding and furnishing the horseand buggy, and taking you horse-back-riding and furnishing the horses?"She shook her head, and declined to answer, at the same time looking atthe door as if to intimate that it was time for this unbusinesslikeconversation to end.  He made one more effort."Do you know, Miss Mason, I haven't a friend in the world outside you?I mean a real friend, man or woman, the kind you chum with, you know,and that you're glad to be with and sorry to be away from.  Hegan isthe nearest man I get to, and he's a million miles away from me.Outside business, we don't hitch.  He's got a big library of books, andsome crazy kind of culture, and he spends all his off times readingthings in French and German and other outlandish lingoes--when he ain'twriting plays and poetry. There's nobody I feel chummy with except you,and you know how little we've chummed--once a week, if it didn't rain,on Sunday. I've grown kind of to depend on you.  You're a sortof--of--of--""A sort of habit," she said with a smile."That's about it.  And that mare, and you astride of her, coming alongthe road under the trees or through the sunshine--why, with both youand the mare missing, there won't be anything worth waiting  throughthe week for.  If you'd just let me buy her back--""No, no; I tell you no."  Dede rose impatiently, but her eyes weremoist with the memory of her pet.  "Please don't mention her to meagain.  If you think it was easy to part with her, you are mistaken.But I've seen the last of her, and I want to forget her."Daylight made no answer, and the door closed behind him.Half an hour later he was conferring with Jones, the erstwhile elevatorboy and rabid proletarian whom Daylight long before had grubstaked toliterature for a year.  The resulting novel had been a failure.Editors and publishers would not look at it, and now Daylight was usingthe disgruntled author in a little private secret service system he hadbeen compelled to establish for himself.  Jones, who affected to besurprised at nothing after his crushing experience with railroadfreight rates on firewood and charcoal, betrayed no surprise now whenthe task was given to him to locate the purchaser of a certain sorrelmare."How high shall I pay for her?" he asked."Any price.  You've got to get her, that's the point.  Drive a sharpbargain so as not to excite suspicion, but buy her.  Then you deliverher to that address up in Sonoma County.  The man's the caretaker on alittle ranch I have there.  Tell him he's to take whacking good care ofher.  And after that forget all about it. Don't tell me the name of theman you buy her from.  Don't tell me anything about it except thatyou've got her and delivered her. Savvee?"But the week had not passed, when Daylight noted the flash in Dede'seyes that boded trouble."Something's gone wrong--what is it?" he asked boldly."Mab," she said.  "The man who bought her has sold her already. If Ithought you had anything to do with it--""I don't even know who you sold her to," was Daylight's answer. "Andwhat's more, I'm not bothering my head about her.  She was your mare,and it's none of my business what you did with her. You haven't gother, that's sure and worse luck.  And now, while we're on touchysubjects, I'm going to open another one with you. And you needn't gettouchy about it, for it's not really your business at all."She waited in the pause that followed, eyeing him almost suspiciously."It's about that brother of yours.  He needs more than you can do forhim.  Selling that mare of yours won't send him to Germany. And that'swhat his own doctors say he needs--that crack German specialist whorips a man's bones and muscles into pulp and then molds them all overagain.  Well, I want to send him to Germany and give that crack aflutter, that's all.""If it were only possible" she said, half breathlessly, and whollywithout anger.  "Only it isn't, and you know it isn't.  I can't acceptmoney from you--""Hold on, now," he interrupted.  "Wouldn't you accept a drink of waterfrom one of the Twelve Apostles if you was dying of thirst? Or wouldyou be afraid of his evil intentions"--she made a gesture of dissent"--or of what folks might say about it?""But that's different," she began."Now look here, Miss Mason.  You've got to get some foolish notions outof your head.  This money notion is one of the funniest things I'veseen. Suppose you was falling over a cliff, wouldn't it be all rightfor me to reach out and hold you by the arm?  Sure it would.  Butsuppose you needed another sort of help--instead of the strength of arm,the strength of my pocket? That would be all and that's what they allsay.  But why do they say it.  Because the robber gangs want all thesuckers to be honest and respect money.  If the suckers weren't honestand didn't respect money, where would the robbers be?  Don't you see?The robbers don't deal in arm-holds; they deal in dollars. Thereforearm-holds are just common and ordinary, while dollars are sacred--sosacred that you didn't let me lend you a hand with a few."Or here's another way," he continued, spurred on by her mute protest."It's all right for me to give the strength of my arm when you'refalling over a cliff.  But if I take that same strength of arm and useit at pick-and-shovel work for a day and earn two dollars, you won'thave anything to do with the two dollars.  Yet it's the same oldstrength of arm in a new form, that's all.  Besides, in thisproposition it won't be a claim on you.  It ain't even a loan to you.It's an arm-hold I'm giving your brother--just the same sort ofarm-hold as if he was falling over a cliff.  And a nice one you are, tocome running out and yell 'Stop!' at me, and let your brother go onover the cliff. What he needs to save his legs is that crack inGermany, and that's the arm-hold I'm offering."Wish you could see my rooms.  Walls all decorated with horsehairbridles--scores of them--hundreds of them.  They're no use to me, andthey cost like Sam Scratch.  But there's a lot of convicts making them,and I go on buying.  Why, I've spent more money in a single night onwhiskey than would get the best specialists and pay all the expenses ofa dozen cases like your brother's.  And remember, you've got nothing todo with this.  If your brother wants to look on it as a loan, allright.  It's up to him, and you've got to stand out of the way while Ipull him back from that cliff."Still Dede refused, and Daylight's argument took a more painful turn."I can only guess that you're standing in your brother's way on accountof some mistaken idea in your head that this is my idea of courting.Well, it ain't.  You might as well think I'm courting all thoseconvicts I buy bridles from.  I haven't asked you to marry me, and if Ido I won't come trying to buy you into consenting.  And there won't beanything underhand when I come a-asking."Dede's face was flushed and angry.  "If you knew how ridiculous youare, you'd stop," she blurted out.  "You can make me more uncomfortablethan any man I ever knew.  Every little while you give me to understandthat you haven't asked me to marry you yet. I'm not waiting to beasked, and I warned you from the first that you had no chance.  And yetyou hold it over my head that some time, some day, you're going to askme to marry you.  Go ahead and ask me now, and get your answer and getit over and done with."He looked at her in honest and pondering admiration.  "I want you sobad, Miss Mason, that I don't dast to ask you now," he said, with suchwhimsicality and earnestness as to make her throw her head back in afrank boyish laugh.  "Besides, as I told you, I'm green at it.  I neverwent a-courting before, and I don't want to make any mistakes.""But you're making them all the time," she cried impulsively. "No manever courted a woman by holding a threatened proposal over her headlike a club.""I won't do it any more," he said humbly.  "And anyway, we're off theargument.  My straight talk a minute ago still holds.  You're standingin your brother's way.  No matter what notions you've got in your head,you've got to get out of the way and give him a chance.  Will you letme go and see him and talk it over with him?  I'll make it a hard andfast business proposition.  I'll stake him to get well, that's all, andcharge him interest."She visibly hesitated."And just remember one thing, Miss Mason: it's HIS leg, not yours."Still she refrained from giving her answer, and Daylight went onstrengthening his position."And remember, I go over to see him alone.  He's a man, and I can dealwith him better without womenfolks around.  I'll go over to-morrowafternoon."CHAPTER XVIIIDaylight had been wholly truthful when he told Dede that he had no realfriends.  On speaking terms with thousands, on fellowship and drinkingterms with hundreds, he was a lonely man.  He failed to find the oneman, or group of several men, with whom he could be really intimate.Cities did not make for comradeship as did the Alaskan trail.  Besides,the types of men were different. Scornful and contemptuous of businessmen on the one hand, on the other his relations with the San Franciscobosses had been more an alliance of expediency than anything else.  Hehad felt more of kinship for the franker brutality of the bosses andtheir captains, but they had failed to claim any deep respect.  Theywere too prone to crookedness.  Bonds were better than men's word inthis modern world, and one had to look carefully to the bonds.In the old Yukon days it had been different.  Bonds didn't go.  A mansaid he had so much, and even in a poker game his appeasement wasaccepted.Larry Hegan, who rose ably to the largest demands of Daylight'soperations and who had few illusions and less hypocrisy, might haveproved a chum had it not been for his temperamental twist. Strangegenius that he was, a Napoleon of the law, with a power of visioningthat far exceeded Daylight's, he had nothing in common with Daylightoutside the office.  He spent his time with books, a thing Daylightcould not abide.  Also, he devoted himself to the endless writing ofplays which never got beyond manuscript form, and, though Daylight onlysensed the secret taint of it, was a confirmed but temperate eater ofhasheesh. Hegan lived all his life cloistered with books in a world ofagitation.  With the out-of-door world he had no understanding nortolerance.  In food and drink he was abstemious as a monk, whileexercise was a thing abhorrent.  Daylight's friendships, in lieu ofanything closer, were drinking friendships and roistering friendships.And with the passing of the Sunday rides with Dede, he fell back moreand more upon these for diversion.  The cocktail wall of inhibition hereared more assiduously than ever.The big red motor-car was out more frequently now, while a stable handwas hired to give Bob exercise.  In his early San Francisco days, therehad been intervals of easement between his deals, but in this presentbiggest deal of all the strain was unremitting. Not in a month, or two,or three, could his huge land investment be carried to a successfulconsummation.  And so complete and wide-reaching was it thatcomplications and knotty situations constantly arose.  Every daybrought its problems, and when he had solved them in his masterful way,he left the office in his big car, almost sighing with relief atanticipation of the approaching double Martini.  Rarely was he madetipsy.  His constitution was too strong for that.  Instead, he was thatdirest of all drinkers, the steady drinker, deliberate and controlled,who averaged a far higher quantity of alcohol than the irregular andviolent drinker.  For six weeks hard-running he had seen nothing ofDede except in the office, and there he resolutely refrained frommaking approaches.  But by the seventh Sunday his hunger for herovermastered him.  It was a stormy day.A heavy southeast gale was blowing, and squall after squall of rain andwind swept over the city.  He could not take his mind off of her, and apersistent picture came to him of her sitting by a window and sewingfeminine fripperies of some sort.  When the time came for his firstpre-luncheon cocktail to be served to him in his rooms, he did not takeit.Filled with a daring determination, he glanced at his note book forDede's telephone number, and called for the switch.At first it was her landlady's daughter who was raised, but in a minutehe heard the voice he had been hungry to hear."I just wanted to tell you that I'm coming out to see you," he said."I didn't want to break in on you without warning, that was all.""Has something happened?" came her voice."I'll tell you when I get there," he evaded.He left the red car two blocks away and arrived on foot at the pretty,three-storied, shingled Berkeley house.  For an instant only, he wasaware of an inward hesitancy, but the next moment he rang the bell.  Heknew that what he was doing was in direct violation of her wishes, andthat he was setting her a difficult task to receive as a Sunday callerthe multimillionaire and notorious Elam Harnish of newspaper fame.  Onthe other hand, the one thing he did not expect of her was what hewould have termed "silly female capers."And in this he was not disappointed.She came herself to the door to receive him and shake hands with him.He hung his mackintosh and hat on the rack in the comfortable squarehall and turned to her for direction."They are busy in there," she said, indicating the parlor from whichcame the boisterous voices of young people, and through the open doorof which he could see several college youths.  "So you will have tocome into my rooms."She led the way through the door opening out of the hall to the right,and, once inside, he stood awkwardly rooted to the floor, gazing abouthim and at her and all the time trying not to gaze. In his perturbationhe failed to hear and see her invitation to a seat.  So these were herquarters.  The intimacy of it and her making no fuss about it wasstartling, but it was no more than he would have expected of her.  Itwas almost two rooms in one, the one he was in evidently thesitting-room, and the one he could see into, the bedroom.  Beyond anoaken dressing-table, with an orderly litter of combs and brushes anddainty feminine knickknacks, there was no sign of its being used as abedroom. The broad couch, with a cover of old rose and banked high withcushions, he decided must be the bed, but it was farthest from anyexperience of a civilized bed he had ever had.Not that he saw much of detail in that awkward moment of standing.  Hisgeneral impression was one of warmth and comfort and beauty.  Therewere no carpets, and on the hardwood floor he caught a glimpse ofseveral wolf and coyote skins.  What captured and perceptibly held hiseye for a moment was a Crouched Venus that stood on a Steinway uprightagainst a background of mountain-lion skin on the wall.But it was Dede herself that smote most sharply upon sense andperception.  He had always cherished the idea that she was very much awoman--the lines of her figure, her hair, her eyes, her voice, andbirdlike laughing ways had all contributed to this; but here, in herown rooms, clad in some flowing, clinging gown, the emphasis of sex wasstartling.  He had been accustomed to her only in trim tailor suits andshirtwaists, or in riding costume of velvet corduroy, and he was notprepared for this new revelation.  She seemed so much softer, so muchmore pliant, and tender, and lissome.  She was a part of thisatmosphere of quietude and beauty.  She fitted into it just as she hadfitted in with the sober office furnishings."Won't you sit down?" she repeated.He felt like an animal long denied food.  His hunger for her welled upin him, and he proceeded to "wolf" the dainty morsel before him.  Herewas no patience, no diplomacy.  The straightest, direct way was nonetoo quick for him and, had he known it, the least unsuccessful way hecould have chosen."Look here," he said, in a voice that shook with passion, "there's onething I won't do, and that's propose to you in the office.  That's whyI'm here.  Dede Mason, I want you.  I just want you."While he spoke he advanced upon her, his black eyes burning with brightfire, his aroused blood swarthy in his cheek.So precipitate was he, that she had barely time to cry out herinvoluntary alarm and to step back, at the same time catching one ofhis hands as he attempted to gather her into his arms.In contrast to him, the blood had suddenly left her cheeks.  The handthat had warded his hand off and that still held it, was trembling.  Sherelaxed her fingers, and his arm dropped to his side.  She wanted tosay something, do something, to pass on from the awkwardness of thesituation, but no intelligent thought nor action came into her mind.She was aware only of a desire to laugh.  This impulse was partyhysterical and partly spontaneous humor--the latter growing frominstant to instant.  Amazing as the affair was, the ridiculous side ofit was not veiled to her. She felt like one who had suffered the terrorof the onslaught of a murderous footpad only to find out that it was aninnocent pedestrian asking the time.Daylight was the quicker to achieve action.  "Oh, I know I'm a sureenough fool," he said.  "I--I guess I'll sit down.  Don't be scairt,Miss Mason.  I'm not real dangerous.""I'm not afraid," she answered, with a smile, slipping down herselfinto a chair, beside which, on the floor, stood a sewing-basket fromwhich, Daylight noted, some white fluffy thing of lace and muslinoverflowed.  Again she smiled.  "Though I confess you did startle mefor the moment.""It's funny," Daylight sighed, almost with regret; "here I am, strongenough to bend you around and tie knots in you.  Here I am, used tohaving my will with man and beast and anything.  And here I am sittingin this chair, as weak and helpless as a little lamb.  You sure takethe starch out of me."Dede vainly cudgeled her brains in quest of a reply to these remarks.Instead, her thought dwelt insistently upon the significance of hisstepping aside, in the middle of a violent proposal, in order to makeirrelevant remarks.  What struck her was the man's certitude.  Solittle did he doubt that he would have her, that he could afford topause and generalize upon love and the effects of love.She noted his hand unconsciously slipping in the familiar way into theside coat pocket where she knew he carried his tobacco and brown papers."You may smoke, if you want to," she said.  He withdrew his hand with ajerk, as if something in the pocket had stung him."No, I wasn't thinking of smoking.  I was thinking of you. What's a manto do when he wants a woman but ask her to marry him?  That's all thatI'm doing.  I can't do it in style.  I know that.  But I can usestraight English, and that's good enough for me.  I sure want youmighty bad, Miss Mason.  You're in my mind 'most all the time, now.And what I want to know is--well, do you want me?  That's all.""I--I wish you hadn't asked," she said softly."Mebbe it's best you should know a few things before you give me ananswer," he went on, ignoring the fact that the answer had already beengiven.  "I never went after a woman before in my life, all reports tothe contrary not withstanding.  The stuff you read about me in thepapers and books, about me being a lady-killer, is all wrong. There'snot an iota of truth in it.  I guess I've done more than my share ofcard-playing and whiskey-drinking, but women I've let alone.  There wasa woman that killed herself, but I didn't know she wanted me that bador else I'd have married her--not for love, but to keep her fromkilling herself.  She was the best of the boiling, but I never gave herany encouragement.  I'm telling you all this because you've read aboutit, and I want you to get it straight from me."Lady-killer!" he snorted.  "Why, Miss Mason, I don't mind telling youthat I've sure been scairt of women all my life. You're the first oneI've not been afraid of.  That's the strange thing about it.  I justplumb worship you, and yet I'm not afraid of you.  Mebbe it's becauseyou're different from the women I know.  You've never chased me.Lady-killer!  Why, I've been running away from ladies ever since I canremember, and I guess all that saved me was that I was strong in thewind and that I never fell down and broke a leg or anything."I didn't ever want to get married until after I met you, and until along time after I met you.  I cottoned to you from the start; but Inever thought it would get as bad as marriage.  Why, I can't get tosleep nights, thinking of you and wanting you."He came to a stop and waited.  She had taken the lace and muslin fromthe basket, possibly to settle her nerves and wits, and was sewing uponit.  As she was not looking at him, he devoured her with his eyes.  Henoted the firm, efficient hands--hands that could control a horse likeBob, that could run a typewriter almost as fast as a man could talk,that could sew on dainty garments, and that, doubtlessly, could play onthe piano over there in the corner.  Another ultra-feminine detail henoticed--her slippers.  They were small and bronze.  He had neverimagined she had such a small foot.  Street shoes and riding boots wereall that he had ever seen on her feet, and they had given noadvertisement of this.  The bronze slippers fascinated him, and to themhis eyes repeatedly turned.A knock came at the door, which she answered.  Daylight could not helphearing the conversation.  She was wanted at the telephone."Tell him to call up again in ten minutes," he heard her say, and themasculine pronoun caused in him a flashing twinge of jealousy.  Well,he decided, whoever it was, Burning Daylight would give him a run forhis money.  The marvel to him was that a girl like Dede hadn't beenmarried long since.She came back, smiling to him, and resumed her sewing.  His eyeswandered from the efficient hands to the bronze slippers and backagain, and he swore to himself that there were mighty few stenographerslike her in existence.  That was because she must have come of prettygood stock, and had a pretty good raising. Nothing else could explainthese rooms of hers and the clothes she wore and the way she wore them."Those ten minutes are flying," he suggested."I can't marry you," she said."You don't love me?"She shook her head."Do you like me--the littlest bit?"This time she nodded, at the same time allowing the smile of amusementto play on her lips.  But it was amusement without contempt.  Thehumorous side of a situation rarely appealed in vain to her."Well, that's something to go on," he announced.  "You've got to make astart to get started.  I just liked you at first, and look what it'sgrown into.  You recollect, you said you didn't like my way of life.Well, I've changed it a heap.  I ain't gambling like I used to.  I'vegone into what you called the legitimate, making two minutes grow whereone grew before, three hundred thousand folks where only a hundredthousand grew before.  And this time next year there'll be two millioneucalyptus growing on the hills.  Say do you like me more than thelittlest bit?"She raised her eyes from her work and looked at him as she answered:"I like you a great deal, but--"He waited a moment for her to complete the sentence, failing which, hewent on himself."I haven't an exaggerated opinion of myself, so I know I ain't braggingwhen I say I'll make a pretty good husband.  You'd find I was no handat nagging and fault-finding. I can guess what it must be for a womanlike you to be independent.  Well, you'd be independent as my wife.  Nostrings on you.  You could follow your own sweet will, and nothingwould be too good for you.  I'd give you everything your heartdesired--""Except yourself," she interrupted suddenly, almost sharply.Daylight's astonishment was momentary."I don't know about that.  I'd be straight and square, and live true.I don't hanker after divided affections.""I don't mean that," she said.  "Instead of giving yourself to yourwife, you would give yourself to the three hundred thousand people ofOakland, to your street railways and ferry-routes, to the two milliontrees on the hills to everything business--and--and to all that thatmeans.""I'd see that I didn't," he declared stoutly.  "I'd be yours tocommand.""You think so, but it would turn out differently."  She suddenly becamenervous.  "We must stop this talk.  It is too much like attempting todrive a bargain.  'How much will you give?'  'I'll give so much.' 'Iwant more,' and all that.  I like you, but not enough to marry you, andI'll never like you enough to marry you.""How do you know that?" he demanded."Because I like you less and less."Daylight sat dumfounded.  The hurt showed itself plainly in his face."Oh, you don't understand," she cried wildly, beginning to loseself-control--"It's not that way I mean.  I do like you; the more I'veknown you the more I've liked you.  And at the same time the more I'veknown you the less would I care to marry you."This enigmatic utterance completed Daylight's perplexity."Don't you see?" she hurried on.  "I could have far easier married theElam Harnish fresh from Klondike, when I first laid eyes on him longago, than marry you sitting before me now."He shook his head slowly.  "That's one too many for me.  The more youknow and like a man the less you want to marry him. Familiarity breedscontempt--I guess that's what you mean.""No, no," she cried, but before she could continue, a knock came on thedoor."The ten minutes is up," Daylight said.His eyes, quick with observation like an Indian's, darted about theroom while she was out.  The impression of warmth and comfort andbeauty predominated, though he was unable to analyze it; while thesimplicity delighted him--expensive simplicity, he decided, and most ofit leftovers from the time her father went broke and died.  He hadnever before appreciated a plain hardwood floor with a couple ofwolfskins; it sure beat all the carpets in creation.  He staredsolemnly at a bookcase containing a couple of hundred books.  There wasmystery.  He could not understand what people found so much to writeabout.Writing things and reading things were not the same as doing things,and himself primarily a man of action, doing things was alonecomprehensible.His gaze passed on from the Crouched Venus to a little tea-table withall its fragile and exquisite accessories, and to a shining copperkettle and copper chafing-dish.  Chafing dishes were not unknown tohim, and he wondered if she concocted suppers on this one for some ofthose University young men he had heard whispers about.  One or twowater-colors on the wall made him conjecture that she had painted themherself.  There were photographs of horses and of old masters, and thetrailing purple of a Burial of Christ held him for a time.  But everhis gaze returned to that Crouched Venus on the piano.  To his homely,frontier-trained mind, it seemed curious that a nice young woman shouldhave such a bold, if not sinful, object on display in her own room.But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.  Since it was Dede,it must be eminently all right.  Evidently such things went along withculture.  Larry Hegan had similar casts and photographs in hisbook-cluttered quarters.  But then, Larry Hegan was different.  Therewas that hint of unhealth about him that Daylight invariably sensed inhis presence, while Dede, on the contrary, seemed always so robustlywholesome, radiating an atmosphere compounded of the sun and wind anddust of the open road.  And yet, if such a clean, healthy woman as shewent in for naked women crouching on her piano, it must be all right.Dede made it all right.  She could come pretty close to making anythingall right.  Besides, he didn't understand culture anyway.She reentered the room, and as she crossed it to her chair, he admiredthe way she walked, while the bronze slippers were maddening."I'd like to ask you several questions," he began immediately "Are youthinking of marrying somebody?"She laughed merrily and shook her head."Do you like anybody else more than you like me?--that man at the'phone just now, for instance?""There isn't anybody else.  I don't know anybody I like well enough tomarry.  For that matter, I don't think I am a marrying woman.  Officework seems to spoil one for that."Daylight ran his eyes over her, from her face to the tip of a bronzeslipper, in a way that made the color mantle in her cheeks.  At thesame time he shook his head sceptically."It strikes me that you're the most marryingest woman that ever made aman sit up and take notice.  And now another question. You see, I'vejust got to locate the lay of the land.  Is there anybody you like asmuch as you like me?"But Dede had herself well in hand."That's unfair," she said.  "And if you stop and consider, you willfind that you are doing the very thing you disclaimed--namely, nagging.I refuse to answer any more of your questions.  Let us talk about otherthings. How is Bob?"Half an hour later, whirling along through the rain on Telegraph Avenuetoward Oakland, Daylight smoked one of his brown-paper cigarettes andreviewed what had taken place.  It was not at all bad, was his summingup, though there was much about it that was baffling.  There was thatliking him the more she knew him and at the same time wanting to marryhim less.  That was a puzzler.But the fact that she had refused him carried with it a certainelation.  In refusing him she had refused his thirty million dollars.That was going some for a ninety dollar-a-month stenographer who hadknown better times.  She wasn't after money, that was patent.  Everywoman he had encountered had seemed willing to swallow him down for thesake of his money.  Why, he had doubled his fortune, made fifteenmillions, since the day she first came to work for him, and behold, anywillingness to marry him she might have possessed had diminished as hismoney had increased."Gosh!" he muttered.  "If I clean up a hundred million on this landdeal she won't even be on speaking terms with me."But he could not smile the thing away.  It remained to baffle him, thatenigmatic statement of hers that she could more easily have married theElam Harnish fresh from the Klondike than the present Elam Harnish.Well, he concluded, the thing to do was for him to become more likethat old-time Daylight who had come down out of the North to try hisluck at the bigger game.  But that was impossible.  He could not setback the flight of time. Wishing wouldn't do it, and there was no otherway.  He might as well wish himself a boy again.Another satisfaction he cuddled to himself from their interview. He hadheard of stenographers before, who refused their employers, and whoinvariably quit their positions immediately afterward.  But Dede hadnot even hinted at such a thing.  No matter how baffling she was, therewas no nonsensical silliness about her.  She was level headed.  But,also, he had been level-headed and was partly responsible for this.  Hehadn't taken advantage of her in the office.  True, he had twiceoverstepped the bounds, but he had not followed it up and made apractice of it.  She knew she could trust him.  But in spite of allthis he was confident that most young women would have been sillyenough to resign a position with a man they had turned down.  Andbesides, after he had put it to her in the right light, she had notbeen silly over his sending her brother to Germany."Gee!" he concluded, as the car drew up before his hotel.  "If I'd onlyknown it as I do now, I'd have popped the question the first day shecame to work.  According to her say-so, that would have been the propermoment.  She likes me more and more, and the more she likes me the lessshe'd care to marry me!  Now what do you think of that?  She sure mustbe fooling."CHAPTER XIXOnce again, on a rainy Sunday, weeks afterward, Daylight proposed toDede.  As on the first time, he restrained himself until his hunger forher overwhelmed him and swept him away in his red automobile toBerkeley.  He left the machine several blocks away and proceeded to thehouse on foot.  But Dede was out, the landlady's daughter told him, andadded, on second thought, that she was out walking in the hills.Furthermore, the young lady directed him where Dede's walk was mostlikely to extend.Daylight obeyed the girl's instructions, and soon the street hefollowed passed the last house and itself ceased where began the firststeep slopes of the open hills.  The air was damp with the on-coming ofrain, for the storm had not yet burst, though the rising windproclaimed its imminence.  As far as he could see, there was no sign ofDede on the smooth, grassy hills.  To the right, dipping down into ahollow and rising again, was a large, full-grown eucalyptus grove.Here all was noise and movement, the lofty, slender trunked treesswaying back and forth in the wind and clashing their branchestogether.  In the squalls, above all the minor noises of creaking andgroaning, arose a deep thrumming note as of a mighty harp.  KnowingDede as he did, Daylight was confident that he would find her somewherein this grove where the storm effects were so pronounced.  And find herhe did, across the hollow and on the exposed crest of the opposingslope where the gale smote its fiercest blows.There was something monotonous, though not tiresome, about the wayDaylight proposed.  Guiltless of diplomacy subterfuge, he was as directand gusty as the gale itself.  He had time neither for greeting norapology."It's the same old thing," he said.  "I want you and I've come for you.You've just got to have me, Dede, for the more I think about it themore certain I am that you've got a Sneaking liking for me that'ssomething more than just Ordinary liking.  And you don't dast say thatit isn't; now dast you?"He had shaken hands with her at the moment he began speaking, and hehad continued to hold her hand.  Now, when she did not answer, she felta light but firmly insistent pressure as of his drawing her to him.Involuntarily, she half-yielded to him, her desire for the momentstronger than her will.  Then suddenly she drew herself away, thoughpermitting her hand still to remain in his."You sure ain't afraid of me?" he asked, with quick compunction."No."  She smiled woefully.  "Not of you, but of myself.""You haven't taken my dare," he urged under this encouragement."Please, please," she begged.  "We can never marry, so don't let usdiscuss it.""Then I copper your bet to lose."  He was almost gay, now, for successwas coming faster than his fondest imagining.  She liked him, without adoubt; and without a doubt she liked him well enough to let him holdher hand, well enough to be not repelled by the nearness of him.She shook her head.  "No, it is impossible.  You would lose your bet."For the first time a dark suspicion crossed Daylight's mind--a clewthat explained everything."Say, you ain't been let in for some one of these secret marriages haveyou?"The consternation in his voice and on his face was too much for her,and her laugh rang out, merry and spontaneous as a burst of joy fromthe throat of a bird.Daylight knew his answer, and, vexed with himself decided that actionwas more efficient than speech.  So he stepped between her and the windand drew her so that she stood close in the shelter of him.  Anunusually stiff squall blew about them and thrummed overhead in thetree-tops and both paused to listen.  A shower of flying leavesenveloped them, and hard on the heel of the wind came driving drops ofrain.  He looked down on her and on her hair wind-blown about her face;and because of her closeness to him and of a fresher and more poignantrealization of what she meant to him, he trembled so that she was awareof it in the hand that held hers.She suddenly leaned against him, bowing her head until it restedlightly upon his breast.  And so they stood while another squall, withflying leaves and scattered drops of rain, rattled past. With equalsuddenness she lifted her head and looked at him."Do you know," she said, "I prayed last night about you.  I prayed thatyou would fail, that you would lose everything everything."Daylight stared his amazement at this cryptic utterance.  "That surebeats me.  I always said I got out of my depth with women, and you'vegot me out of my depth now.  Why you want me to lose everything, seeingas you like me--""I never said so.""You didn't dast say you didn't.  So, as I was saying: liking me, whyyou'd want me to go broke is clean beyond my simple understanding.It's right in line with that other puzzler of yours, themore-you-like-me-the-less-you-want-to-marry-me one. Well, you've justgot to explain, that's all."His arms went around her and held her closely, and this time she didnot resist.  Her head was bowed, and he had not see her face, yet hehad a premonition that she was crying.  He had learned the virtue ofsilence, and he waited her will in the matter.  Things had come to sucha pass that she was bound to tell him something now.  Of that he wasconfident."I am not romantic," she began, again looking at him as he spoke."It might be better for me if I were.  Then I could make a fool ofmyself and be unhappy for the rest of my life.  But my abominablecommon sense prevents.  And that doesn't make me a bit happier, either.""I'm still out of my depth and swimming feeble," Daylight said, afterwaiting vainly for her to go on.  "You've got to show me, and you ain'tshown me yet.  Your common sense and praying that I'd go broke is allup in the air to me.  Little woman, I just love you mighty hard, and Iwant you to marry me.  That's straight and simple and right off thebat.  Will you marry me?"She shook her head slowly, and then, as she talked, seemed to growangry, sadly angry; and Daylight knew that this anger was against him."Then let me explain, and just as straight and simply as you haveasked."  She paused, as if casting about for a beginning.  "You arehonest and straightforward.  Do you want me to be honest andstraightforward as a woman is not supposed to be?--to tell you thingsthat will hurt you?--to make confessions that ought to shame me?  tobehave in what many men would think was an unwomanly manner?"The arm around her shoulder pressed encouragement, but he did not speak."I would dearly like to marry you, but I am afraid.  I am proud andhumble at the same time that a man like you should care for me.  Butyou have too much money.  There's where my abominable common sensesteps in.  Even if we did marry, you could never be my man--my loverand my husband.  You would be your money's man. I know I am a foolishwoman, but I want my man for myself.  You would not be free for me.Your money possesses you, taking your time, your thoughts, your energy,everything, bidding you go here and go there, do this and do that.Don't you see?  Perhaps it's pure silliness, but I feel that I can lovemuch, give much--give all, and in return, though I don't want all, Iwant much--and I want much more than your money would permit you togive me."And your money destroys you; it makes you less and less nice. I am notashamed to say that I love you, because I shall never marry you.  And Iloved you much when I did not know you at all, when you first came downfrom Alaska and I first went into the office.  You were my hero.  Youwere the Burning Daylight of the gold-diggings, the daring traveler andminer.  And you looked it. I don't see how any woman could have lookedat you without loving you--then.  But you don't look it now."Please, please, forgive me for hurting you.  You wanted straight talk,and I am giving it to you.  All these last years you have been livingunnaturally.  You, a man of the open, have been cooping yourself up inthe cities with all that that means.  You are not the same man at all,and your money is destroying you. You are becoming something different,something not so healthy, not so clean, not so nice.  Your money andyour way of life are doing it.  You know it.  You haven't the same bodynow that you had then.  You are putting on flesh, and it is not healthyflesh. You are kind and genial with me, I know, but you are not kindand genial to all the world as you were then.  You have become harshand cruel.  And I know.  Remember, I have studied you six days a week,month after month, year after year; and I know more about the mostinsignificant parts of you than you know of all of me. The cruelty isnot only in your heart and thoughts, but it is there in face.  It hasput its lines there.  I have watched them come and grow.  Your money,and the life it compels you to lead have done all this.  You are beingbrutalized and degraded.  And this process can only go on and on untilyou are hopelessly destroyed--"He attempted to interrupt, but she stopped him, herself breathless andher voice trembling."No, no; let me finish utterly.  I have done nothing but think, think,think, all these months, ever since you came riding with me, and nowthat I have begun to speak I am going to speak all that I have in me.I do love you, but I cannot marry you and destroy love.  You aregrowing into a thing that I must in the end despise.  You can't helpit.  More than you can possibly love me, do you love this businessgame.  This business--and it's all perfectly useless, so far as you areconcerned--claims all of you.  I sometimes think it would be easier toshare you equitably with another woman than to share you with thisbusiness.  I might have half of you, at any rate.  But this businesswould claim, not half of you, but nine-tenths of you, or ninety-ninehundredths."Remember, the meaning of marriage to me is not to get a man's money tospend.  I want the man.  You say you want ME.  And suppose I consented,but gave you only one-hundredth part of me. Suppose there was somethingelse in my life that took the other ninety-nine parts, and,furthermore, that ruined my figure, that put pouches under my eyes andcrows-feet in the corners, that made me unbeautiful to look upon andthat made my spirit unbeautiful.  Would you be satisfied with thatone-hundredth part of me?  Yet that is all you are offering me ofyourself.  Do you wonder that I won't marry you?--that I can't?"Daylight waited to see if she were quite done, and she went on again."It isn't that I am selfish.  After all, love is giving, not receiving.But I see so clearly that all my giving could not do you any good.  Youare like a sick man.  You don't play business like other men.  You playit heart and and all of you.  No matter what you believed and intendeda wife would be only a brief diversion.  There is that magnificent Bob,eating his head off in the stable.  You would buy me a beautifulmansion and leave me in it to yawn my head off, or cry my eyes outbecause of my helplessness and inability to save you.  This disease ofbusiness would be corroding you and marring you all the time.  You playit as you have played everything else, as in Alaska you played the lifeof the trail.  Nobody could be permitted to travel as fast and as faras you, to work as hard or endure as much.  You hold back nothing; youput all you've got into whatever you are doing.""Limit is the sky," he grunted grim affirmation."But if you would only play the lover-husband that way--"Her voice faltered and stopped, and a blush showed in her wet cheeks asher eyes fell before his."And now I won't say another word," she added. "I've delivered a wholesermon."She rested now, frankly and fairly, in the shelter of his arms, andboth were oblivious to the gale that rushed past them in quicker andstronger blasts.  The big downpour of rain had not yet come, but themist-like squalls were more frequent.  Daylight was openly perplexed,and he was still perplexed when he began to speak."I'm stumped.  I'm up a tree.  I'm clean flabbergasted, Miss Mason--orDede, because I love to call you that name.  I'm free to confessthere's a mighty big heap in what you say.  As I understand it, yourconclusion is that you'd marry me if I hadn't a cent and if I wasn'tgetting fat.  No, no; I'm not joking.  I acknowledge the corn, andthat's just my way of boiling the matter down and summing it up.  If Ihadn't a cent, and if I was living a healthy life with all the time inthe world to love you and be your husband instead of being awash to myback teeth in business and all the rest--why, you'd marry me."That's all as clear as print, and you're correcter than I ever guessedbefore.  You've sure opened my eyes a few.  But I'm stuck.  What can Ido?  My business has sure roped, thrown, and branded me.  I'm tied handand foot, and I can't get up and meander over green pastures.  I'm likethe man that got the bear by the tail.  I can't let go; and I want you,and I've got to let go to get you."I don't know what to do, but something's sure got to happen--I can'tlose you.  I just can't.  And I'm not going to.  Why, you're runningbusiness a close second right now.  Business never kept me awake nights."You've left me no argument.  I know I'm not the same man that camefrom Alaska.  I couldn't hit the trail with the dogs as I did in themdays.  I'm soft in my muscles, and my mind's gone hard.  I used torespect men.  I despise them now.  You see, I spent all my life in theopen, and I reckon I'm an open-air man. Why, I've got the prettiestlittle ranch you ever laid eyes on, up in Glen Ellen.  That's where Igot stuck for that brick-yard. You recollect handling thecorrespondence.  I only laid eyes on the ranch that one time, and I sofell in love with it that I bought it there and then.  I just rodearound the hills, and was happy as a kid out of school.  I'd be abetter man living in the country.  The city doesn't make me better.You're plumb right there.  I know it.  But suppose your prayer shouldbe answered and I'd go clean broke and have to work for day's wages?"She did not answer, though all the body of her seemed to urge consent."Suppose I had nothing left but that little ranch, and was satisfied togrow a few chickens and scratch a living somehow--would you marry methen, Dede?""Why, we'd be together all the time!" she cried."But I'd have to be out ploughing once in a while," he warned, "ordriving to town to get the grub.""But there wouldn't be the office, at any rate, and no man to see, andmen to see without end.  But it is all foolish and impossible, andwe'll have to be starting back now if we're to escape the rain."Then was the moment, among the trees, where they began the descent ofthe hill, that Daylight might have drawn her closely to him and kissedher once.  But he was too perplexed with the new thoughts she had putinto his head to take advantage of the situation.  He merely caught herby the arm and helped her over the rougher footing."It's darn pretty country up there at Glen Ellen," he saidmeditatively.  "I wish you could see it."At the edge of the grove he suggested that it might be better for themto part there."It's your neighborhood, and folks is liable to talk."But she insisted that he accompany her as far as the house."I can't ask you in," she said, extending her hand at the foot of thesteps.The wind was humming wildly in sharply recurrent gusts, but still therain held off."Do you know," he said, "taking it by and large, it's the happiest dayof my life."  He took off his hat, and the wind rippled and twisted hisblack hair as he went on solemnly, "And I'm sure grateful to God, orwhoever or whatever is responsible for your being on this earth.  Foryou do like me heaps.  It's been my joy to hear you say so to-day.It's--" He left the thought arrested, and his face assumed the familiarwhimsical expression as he murmured: "Dede, Dede, we've just got to getmarried.  It's the only way, and trust to luck for it's coming out allright--".But the tears were threatening to rise in her eyes again, as she shookher head and turned and went up the steps.CHAPTER XXWhen the ferry system began to run, and the time between Oakland andSan Francisco was demonstrated to be cut in half, the tide ofDaylight's terrific expenditure started to turn.  Not that it reallydid turn, for he promptly went into further investments. Thousands oflots in his residence tracts were sold, and thousands of homes werebeing built.  Factory sites also were selling, and business propertiesin the heart of Oakland.  All this tended to a steady appreciation invalue of Daylight's huge holdings.  But, as of old, he had his hunchand was riding it. Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.  Themagnificent profits he made on the land he sold were turned into moreland, into more development; and instead of paying off old loans, hecontracted new ones.  As he had pyramided in Dawson City, he nowpyramided in Oakland; but he did it with the knowledge that it was astable enterprise rather than a risky placer-mining boom.In a small way, other men were following his lead, buying and sellingland and profiting by the improvement work he was doing. But this wasto be expected, and the small fortunes they were making at his expensedid not irritate him.  There was an exception, however.  One SimonDolliver, with money to go in with, and with cunning and courage toback it up, bade fair to become a several times millionaire atDaylight's expense. Dolliver, too, pyramided, playing quickly andaccurately, and keeping his money turning over and over.  More thanonce Daylight found him in the way, as he himself had got in the way ofthe Guggenhammers when they first set their eyes on Ophir Creek.Work on Daylight's dock system went on apace, yet was one of thoseenterprises that consumed money dreadfully and that could not beaccomplished as quickly as a ferry system.  The engineeringdifficulties were great, the dredging and filling a cyclopean task.The mere item of piling was anything but small. A good average pile, bythe time it was delivered on the ground, cost a twenty-dollar goldpiece, and these piles were used in unending thousands.  All accessiblegroves of mature eucalyptus were used, and as well, great rafts of pinepiles were towed down the coast from Peugeot Sound.Not content with manufacturing the electricity for his street railwaysin the old-fashioned way, in power-houses, Daylight organized theSierra and Salvador Power Company.  This immediately assumed largeproportions.  Crossing the San Joaquin Valley on the way from themountains, and plunging through the Contra Costa hills, there were manytowns, and even a robust city, that could be supplied with power, alsowith light; and it became a street- and house-lighting project as well.As soon as the purchase of power sites in the Sierras was rushedthrough, the survey parties were out and building operations begun.And so it went.  There were a thousand maws into which he pouredunceasing streams of money.  But it was all so sound and legitimate,that Daylight, born gambler that he was, and with his clear, widevision, could not play softly and safely.  It was a big opportunity,and to him there was only one way to play it, and that was the big way.Nor did his one confidential adviser, Larry Hegan, aid him to caution.On the contrary, it was Daylight who was compelled to veto the wildervisions of that able hasheesh dreamer.  Not only did Daylight borrowheavily from the banks and trust companies, but on several of hiscorporations he was compelled to issue stock.  He did this grudginglyhowever, and retained most of his big enterprises of his own.  Amongthe companies in which he reluctantly allowed the investing public tojoin were the Golden Gate Dock Company, and Recreation Parks Company,the United Water Company, the Uncial Shipbuilding Company, and theSierra and Salvador Power Company. Nevertheless, between himself andHegan, he retained the controlling share in each of these enterprises.His affair with Dede Mason only seemed to languish.  While delaying tograpple with the strange problem it presented, his desire for hercontinued to grow.  In his gambling simile, his conclusion was thatLuck had dealt him the most remarkable card in the deck, and that foryears he had overlooked it.  Love was the card, and it beat them all.Love was the king card of trumps, the fifth ace, the joker in a game oftenderfoot poker. It was the card of cards, and play it he would, tothe limit, when the opening came.  He could not see that opening yet.The present game would have to play to some sort of a conclusion first.Yet he could not shake from his brain and vision the warm recollectionof those bronze slippers, that clinging gown, and all the femininesoftness and pliancy of Dede in her pretty Berkeley rooms.  Once again,on a rainy Sunday, he telephoned that he was coming.  And, as hashappened ever since man first looked upon woman and called her good,again he played the blind force of male compulsion against the woman'ssecret weakness to yield.  Not that it was Daylight's way abjectly tobeg and entreat.  On the contrary, he was masterful in whatever he did,but he had a trick of whimsical wheedling that Dede found harder toresist than the pleas of a suppliant lover.  It was not a happy scenein its outcome, for Dede, in the throes of her own desire, desperatewith weakness and at the same time with her better judgment hating herweakness cried out:--"You urge me to try a chance, to marry you now and trust to luck for itto come out right.  And life is a gamble say.  Very well, let usgamble.  Take a coin and toss it in the air.  If it comes heads, I'llmarry you.  If it doesn't, you are forever to leave me alone and nevermention marriage again."A fire of mingled love and the passion of gambling came into Daylight'seyes.  Involuntarily his hand started for his pocket for the coin.Then it stopped, and the light in his eyes was troubled."Go on," she ordered sharply.  "Don't delay, or I may change my mind,and you will lose the chance.""Little woman."  His similes were humorous, but there was no humor intheir meaning.  His thought was as solemn as his voice. "Little woman,I'd gamble all the way from Creation to the Day of Judgment; I'd gamblea golden harp against another man's halo; I'd toss for pennies on thefront steps of the New Jerusalem or set up a faro layout just outsidethe Pearly Gates; but I'll be everlastingly damned if I'll gamble onlove.  Love's too big to me to take a chance on.  Love's got to be asure thing, and between you and me it is a sure thing.  If the odds wasa hundred to one on my winning this flip, just the same, nary a flip."In the spring of the year the Great Panic came on.  The first warningwas when the banks began calling in their unprotected loans.  Daylightpromptly paid the first several of his personal notes that werepresented; then he divined that these demands but indicated the way thewind was going to blow, and that one of those terrific financial stormshe had heard about was soon to sweep over the United States.  Howterrific this particular storm was to be he did not anticipate.Nevertheless, he took every precaution in his power, and had no anxietyabout his weathering it out.Money grew tighter.  Beginning with the crash of several of thegreatest Eastern banking houses, the tightness spread, until every bankin the country was calling in its credits.  Daylight was caught, andcaught because of the fact that for the first time he had been playingthe legitimate business game.  In the old days, such a panic, with theaccompanying extreme shrinkage of values, would have been a goldenharvest time for him.  As it was, he watched the gamblers, who hadridden the wave of prosperity and made preparation for the slump,getting out from under and safely scurrying to cover or proceeding toreap a double harvest.  Nothing remained for him but to stand fast andhold up.He saw the situation clearly.  When the banks demanded that he pay hisloans, he knew that the banks were in sore need of the money.  But hewas in sorer need.  And he knew that the banks did not want hiscollateral which they held.  It would do them no good.  In such atumbling of values was no time to sell.  His collateral was good, allof it, eminently sound and worth while; yet it was worthless at such amoment, when the one unceasing cry was money, money, money.  Findinghim obdurate, the banks demanded more collateral, and as the moneypinch tightened they asked for two and even three times as much as hadbeen originally accepted.  Sometimes Daylight yielded to these demands,but more often not, and always battling fiercely.He fought as with clay behind a crumbling wall.  All portions of thewall were menaced, and he went around constantly strengthening theweakest parts with clay.  This clay was money, and was applied, a sophere and a sop there, as fast as it was needed, but only when it wasdirectly needed.  The strength of his position lay in the Yerba BuenaFerry Company, the Consolidated Street Railways, and the United WaterCompany. Though people were no longer buying residence lots and factoryand business sites, they were compelled to ride on his cars andferry-boats and to consume his water.  When all the financial world wasclamoring for money and perishing through lack of it, the first of eachmonth many thousands of dollars poured into his coffers from thewater-rates, and each day ten thousand dollars, in dime and nickels,came in from his street railways and ferries.Cash was what was wanted, and had he had the use of all this steadyriver of cash, all would have been well with him.  As it was, he had tofight continually for a portion of it. Improvement work ceased, andonly absolutely essential repairs were made.  His fiercest fight waswith the operating expenses, and this was a fight that never ended.There was never any let-up in his turning the thumb-screws of extendedcredit and economy.  From the big wholesale suppliers down through thesalary list to office stationery and postage stamps, he kept thethumb-screws turning.  When his superintendents and heads ofdepartments performed prodigies of cutting down, he patted them on theback and demanded more.  When they threw down their hands in despair,he showed them how more could be accomplished."You are getting eight thousand dollars a year," he told Matthewson."It's better pay than you ever got in your life before.  Your fortuneis in the same sack with mine.  You've got to stand for some of thestrain and risk.  You've got personal credit in this town.  Use it.Stand off butcher and baker and all the rest.  Savvee?  You're drawingdown something like six hundred and sixty dollars a month.  I want thatcash.  From now on, stand everybody off and draw down a hundred.  I'llpay you interest on the rest till this blows over."Two weeks later, with the pay-roll before them, it was:--"Matthewson, who's this bookkeeper, Rogers?  Your nephew?  I thoughtso.  He's pulling down eighty-five a month.  After--this let him drawthirty-five.  The forty can ride with me at interest.""Impossible!" Matthewson cried.  "He can't make ends meet on his salaryas it is, and he has a wife and two kids--"Daylight was upon him with a mighty oath."Can't! Impossible!  What in hell do you think I'm running?  A home forfeeble-minded?  Feeding and dressing and wiping the little noses of alot of idiots that can't take care of themselves?  Not on your life.I'm hustling, and now's the time that everybody that works for me hasgot to hustle.  I want no fair-weather birds holding down my officechairs or anything else.  This is nasty weather, damn nasty weather,and they've got to buck into it just like me.  There are ten thousandmen out of work in Oakland right now, and sixty thousand more in SanFrancisco.  Your nephew, and everybody else on your pay-roll, can do asI say right now or quit.  Savvee?  If any of them get stuck, you goaround yourself and guarantee their credit with the butchers andgrocers.  And you trim down that pay-roll accordingly.  I've beencarrying a few thousand folks that'll have to carry themselves for awhile now, that's all.""You say this filter's got to be replaced," he told his chief of thewater-works.  "We'll see about it.  Let the people of Oakland drink mudfor a change.  It'll teach them to appreciate good water.  Stop work atonce.  Get those men off the pay-roll. Cancel all orders for material.The contractors will sue?  Let 'em sue and be damned.  We'll be bustedhigher'n a kite or on easy street before they can get judgment."And to Wilkinson:"Take off that owl boat.  Let the public roar and come home early toits wife.  And there's that last car that connects with the 12:45 boatat Twenty-second and Hastings.  Cut it out.  I can't run it for two orthree passengers.  Let them take an earlier boat home or walk.  This isno time for philanthropy.  And you might as well take off a few morecars in the rush hours.  Let the strap-hangers pay.  It's thestrap-hangers that'll keep us from going under."And to another chief, who broke down under the excessive strain ofretrenchment:--"You say I can't do that and can't do this.  I'll just show you a fewof the latest patterns in the can-and-can't line.  You'll be compelledto resign?  All right, if you think so I never saw the man yet that Iwas hard up for.  And when any man thinks I can't get along withouthim, I just show him the latest pattern in that line of goods and givehim his walking-papers."And so he fought and drove and bullied and even wheedled his way along.It was fight, fight, fight, and no let-up, from the first thing in themorning till nightfall.  His private office saw throngs every day.  Allmen came to see him, or were ordered to come.  Now it was an optimisticopinion on the panic, a funny story, a serious business talk, or astraight take-it-or-leave-it blow from the shoulder.  And there wasnobody to relieve him.  It was a case of drive, drive, drive, and healone could do the driving.  And this went on day after day, while thewhole business world rocked around him and house after house crashed tothe ground."It's all right, old man," he told Hegan every morning; and it was thesame cheerful word that he passed out all day long, except at suchtimes when he was in the thick of fighting to have his will withpersons and things.Eight o'clock saw him at his desk each morning.  By ten o'clock, it wasinto the machine and away for a round of the banks.  And usually in themachine with him was the ten thousand and more dollars that had beenearned by his ferries and railways the day before.  This was for theweakest spot in the financial dike. And with one bank president afteranother similar scenes were enacted.  They were paralyzed with fear,and first of all he played his role of the big vital optimist.  Timeswere improving.Of course they were.  The signs were already in the air.  All thatanybody had to do was to sit tight a little longer and hold on.  Thatwas all.  Money was already more active in the East. Look at thetrading on Wall Street of the last twenty-four hours.That was the straw that showed the wind.  Hadn't Ryan said so and so?and wasn't it reported that Morgan was preparing to do this and that?As for himself, weren't the street-railway earnings increasingsteadily?  In spite of the panic, more and more people were coming toOakland right along.  Movements were already beginning in real estate.He was dickering even then to sell over a thousand of his suburbanacres.  Of course it was at a sacrifice, but it would ease the strainon all of them and bolster up the faint-hearted.  That was thetrouble--the faint-hearts.  Had there been no faint-hearts there wouldhave been no panic.  There was that Eastern syndicate, negotiating withhim now to take the majority of the stock in the Sierra and SalvadorPower Company off his hands.  That showed confidence that better timeswere at hand.And if it was not cheery discourse, but prayer and entreaty or showdown and fight on the part of the banks, Daylight had to counter inkind.  If they could bully, he could bully.  If the favor he asked wererefused, it became the thing he demanded. And when it came down to rawand naked fighting, with the last veil of sentiment or illusion tornoff, he could take their breaths away.But he knew, also, how and when to give in.  When he saw the wallshaking and crumbling irretrievably at a particular place, he patchedit up with sops of cash from his three cash-earning companies.  If thebanks went, he went too.  It was a case of their having to hold out.If they smashed and all the collateral they held of his was thrown onthe chaotic market, it would be the end.  And so it was, as the timepassed, that on occasion his red motor-car carried, in addition to thedaily cash, the most gilt-edged securities he possessed; namely, theFerry Company, United Water and Consolidated Railways.  But he did thisreluctantly, fighting inch by inch.As he told the president of the Merchants San Antonio who made the pleaof carrying so many others:--"They're small fry.  Let them smash.  I'm the king pin here. You've gotmore money to make out of me than them.  Of course, you're carrying toomuch, and you've got to choose, that's all. It's root hog or die foryou or them.  I'm too strong to smash. You could only embarrass me andget yourself tangled up.  Your way out is to let the small fry go, andI'll lend you a hand to do it."And it was Daylight, also, in this time of financial anarchy, who sizedup Simon Dolliver's affairs and lent the hand that sent that rival downin utter failure.  The Golden Gate National was the keystone ofDolliver's strength, and to the president of that institution Daylightsaid:--"Here I've been lending you a hand, and you now in the last ditch, withDolliver riding on you and me all the time.  It don't go.  You hear me,it don't go.  Dolliver couldn't cough up eleven dollars to save you.Let him get off and walk, and I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll giveyou the railway nickels for four days--that's forty thousand cash.  Andon the sixth of the month you can count on twenty thousand more fromthe Water Company." He shrugged his shoulders.  "Take it or leave it.Them's my terms.""It's dog eat dog, and I ain't overlooking any meat that's floatingaround," Daylight proclaimed that afternoon to Hegan; and SimonDolliver went the way of the unfortunate in the Great Panic who werecaught with plenty of paper and no money.Daylight's shifts and devices were amazing.  Nothing however large orsmall, passed his keen sight unobserved. The strain he was under wasterrific.  He no longer ate lunch.  The days were too short, and hisnoon hours and his office were as crowded as at any other time.  By theend of the day he was exhausted, and, as never before, he sought reliefbehind his wall of alcoholic inhibition.  Straight to his hotel he wasdriven, and straight to his rooms he went, where immediately was mixedfor him the first of a series of double Martinis.  By dinner, his brainwas well clouded and the panic forgotten.  By bedtime, with theassistance of Scotch whiskey, he was full--not violently noruproariously full, nor stupefied, but merely well under the influenceof a pleasant and mild anesthetic.Next morning he awoke with parched lips and mouth, and with sensationsof heaviness in his head which quickly passed away. By eight o'clock hewas at his desk, buckled down to the fight, by ten o'clock on hispersonal round of the banks, and after that, without a moment'scessation, till nightfall, he was handling the knotty tangles ofindustry, finance, and human nature that crowded upon him.  And withnightfall it was back to the hotel, the double Martinis and the Scotch;and this was his program day after day until the days ran into weeks.CHAPTER XXIThough Daylight appeared among his fellows hearty voiced,inexhaustible, spilling over with energy and vitality, deep down he wasa very weary man.  And sometime under the liquor drug, snatches ofwisdom came to him far more lucidity than in his sober moments, as, forinstance, one night, when he sat on the edge of the bed with one shoein his hand and meditated on Dede's aphorism to the effect that hecould not sleep in more than one bed at a time.  Still holding theshoe, he looked at the array of horsehair bridles on the walls.  Then,carrying the shoe, he got up and solemnly counted them, journeying intothe two adjoining rooms to complete the tale.  Then he came back to thebed and gravely addressed his shoe:--"The little woman's right.  Only one bed at a time.  One hundred andforty hair bridles, and nothing doing with ary one of them. One bridleat a time!  I can't ride one horse at a time.  Poor old Bob.  I'dbetter be sending you out to pasture.  Thirty million dollars, and ahundred million or nothing in sight, and what have I got to show forit?  There's lots of things money can't buy.  It can't buy the littlewoman.  It can't buy capacity.  What's the good of thirty millions whenI ain't got room for more than a quart of cocktails a day?  If I had ahundred-quart-cocktail thirst, it'd be different.  But one quart--onemeasly little quart!  Here I am, a thirty times over millionaire,slaving harder every day than any dozen men that work for me, and all Iget is two meals that don't taste good, one bed, a quart of Martini,and a hundred and forty hair bridles to look at on the wall."He stared around at the array disconsolately.  "Mr. Shoe, I'm sizzled.Good night."Far worse than the controlled, steady drinker is the solitary drinker,and it was this that Daylight was developing into.  He rarely dranksociably any more, but in his own room, by himself. Returning wearyfrom each day's unremitting effort, he drugged himself to sleep,knowing that on the morrow he would rise up with a dry and burningmouth and repeat the program.But the country did not recover with its wonted elasticity. Money didnot become freer, though the casual reader of Daylight's newspapers, aswell as of all the other owned and subsidised newspapers in thecountry, could only have concluded that the money tightness was overand that the panic was past history.  All public utterances were cheeryand optimistic, but privately many of the utterers were in desperatestraits.  The scenes enacted in the privacy of Daylight's office, andof the meetings of his boards of directors, would have given the lie tothe editorials in his newspapers; as, for instance, when he addressedthe big stockholders in the Sierra and Salvador Power Company, theUnited Water Company, and the several other stock companies:--"You've got to dig.  You've got a good thing, but you'll have tosacrifice in order to hold on.  There ain't no use spouting hard timesexplanations.  Don't I know the hard times is on?  Ain't that whatyou're here for?  As I said before, you've got to dig. I run themajority stock, and it's come to a case of assess. It's that or smash.If ever I start going you won't know what struck you, I'll smash thathard.  The small fry can let go, but you big ones can't.  This shipwon't sink as long as you stay with her.  But if you start to leaveher, down you'll sure go before you can get to shore.  This assessmenthas got to be met that's all."The big wholesale supply houses, the caterers for his hotels, and allthe crowd that incessantly demanded to be paid, had their hothalf-hours with him.  He summoned them to his office and displayed hislatest patterns of can and can't and will and won't."By God, you've got to carry me!" he told them.  "If you think this isa pleasant little game of parlor whist and that you can quit and gohome whenever you want, you're plumb wrong.  Look here, Watkins, youremarked five minutes ago that you wouldn't stand for it.  Now let metell you a few.  You're going to stand for it and keep on standin's forit.  You're going to continue supplying me and taking my paper untilthe pinch is over.  How you're going to do it is your trouble, notmine.  You remember what I did to Klinkner and the Altamont TrustCompany?  I know the inside of your business better than you doyourself, and if you try to drop me I'll smash you.  Even if I'd begoing to smash myself, I'd find a minute to turn on you and bring youdown with me.  It's sink or swim for all of us, and I reckon you'llfind it to your interest to keep me on top the puddle."Perhaps his bitterest fight was with the stockholders of the UnitedWater Company, for it was practically the whole of the gross earningsof this company that he voted to lend to himself and used to bolster uphis wide battle front.  Yet he never pushed his arbitrary rule too far.Compelling sacrifice from the men whose fortunes were tied up with his,nevertheless when any one of them was driven to the wall and was indire need, Daylight was there to help him back into the line.  Only astrong man could have saved so complicated a situation in such time ofstress, and Daylight was that man.  He turned and twisted, schemed anddevised, bludgeoned and bullied the weaker ones, kept the faint-heartedin the fight, and had no mercy on the deserter.And in the end, when early summer was on, everything began to mend.Came a day when Daylight did the unprecedented.  He left the office anhour earlier than usual, and for the reason that for the first timesince the panic there was not an item of work waiting to be done.  Hedropped into Hegan's private office, before leaving, for a chat, and ashe stood up to go, he said:--"Hegan, we're all hunkadory.  We're pulling out of the financialpawnshop in fine shape, and we'll get out without leaving oneunredeemed pledge behind.  The worst is over, and the end is in sight.Just a tight rein for a couple more weeks, just a bit of a pinch or aflurry or so now and then, and we can let go and spit on our hands."For once he varied his program.  Instead of going directly to hishotel, he started on a round of the bars and cafes, drinking a cocktailhere and a cocktail there, and two or three when he encountered men heknew.  It was after an hour or so of this that he dropped into the barof the Parthenon for one last drink before going to dinner.  By thistime all his being was pleasantly warmed by the alcohol, and he was inthe most genial and best of spirits.  At the corner of the bar severalyoung men were up to the old trick of resting their elbows andattempting to force each other's hands down.  One broad-shoulderedyoung giant never removed his elbow, but put down every hand that cameagainst him.  Daylight was interested."It's Slosson," the barkeeper told him, in answer to his query. "He'sthe heavy-hammer thrower at the U.C.  Broke all records this year, andthe world's record on top of it.  He's a husky all right all right."Daylight nodded and went over to him, placing his own arm in opposition."I'd like to go you a flutter, son, on that proposition," he said.The young man laughed and locked hands with him; and to Daylight'sastonishment it was his own hand that was forced down on the bar."Hold on," he muttered.  "Just one more flutter.  I reckon I wasn'tjust ready that time."Again the hands locked.  It happened quickly.  The offensive attack ofDaylight's muscles slipped instantly into defense, and, resistingvainly, his hand was forced over and down.  Daylight was dazed.  It hadbeen no trick.  The skill was equal, or, if anything, the superiorskill had been his.  Strength, sheer strength, had done it.  He calledfor the drinks, and, still dazed and pondering, held up his own arm,and looked at it as at some new strange thing.  He did not know thisarm.  It certainly was not the arm he had carried around with him allthe years. The old arm?  Why, it would have been play to turn down thatyoung husky's.  But this arm--he continued to look at it with suchdubious perplexity as to bring a roar of laughter from the young men.This laughter aroused him.  He joined in it at first, and then his faceslowly grew grave.  He leaned toward the hammer-thrower."Son," he said, "let me whisper a secret.  Get out of here and quitdrinking before you begin."The young fellow flushed angrily, but Daylight held steadily on."You listen to your dad, and let him say a few.  I'm a young manmyself, only I ain't.  Let me tell you, several years ago for me toturn your hand down would have been like committing assault and batteryon a kindergarten."Slosson looked his incredulity, while the others grinned and clusteredaround Daylight encouragingly."Son, I ain't given to preaching.  This is the first time I ever cometo the penitent form, and you put me there yourself--hard. I've seen afew in my time, and I ain't fastidious so as you can notice it.  Butlet me tell you right now that I'm worth the devil alone knows how manymillions, and that I'd sure give it all, right here on the bar, to turndown your hand.  Which means I'd give the whole shooting match just tobe back where I was before I quit sleeping under the stars and comeinto the hen-coops of cities to drink cocktails and lift up my feet andride. Son, that's that's the matter with me, and that's the way I feelabout it.  The game ain't worth the candle.  You just take care ofyourself, and roll my advice over once in a while.  Good night."He turned and lurched out of the place, the moral effect of hisutterance largely spoiled by the fact that he was so patently fullwhile he uttered it.Still in a daze, Daylight made to his hotel, accomplished his dinner,and prepared for bed."The damned young whippersnapper!" he muttered.  "Put my hand down easyas you please.  My hand!"He held up the offending member and regarded it with stupid wonder.The hand that had never been beaten!  The hand that had made the CircleCity giants wince!  And a kid from college, with a laugh on his face,had put it down--twice!  Dede was right.  He was not the same man.  Thesituation would bear more serious looking into than he had ever givenit.  But this was not the time.  In the morning, after a good sleep, hewould give it consideration.CHAPTER XXIIDaylight awoke with the familiar parched mouth and lips and throat,took a long drink of water from the pitcher beside his bed, andgathered up the train of thought where he had left it the night before.He reviewed the easement of the financial strain.  Things were mendingat last.  While the going was still rough, the greatest dangers werealready past.  As he had told Hegan, a tight rein and careful playingwere all that was needed now.  Flurries and dangers were bound to come,but not so grave as the ones they had already weathered.  He had beenhit hard, but he was coming through without broken bones, which wasmore than Simon Dolliver and many another could say.  And not one ofhis business friends had been ruined.  He had compelled them to stay inline to save himself, and they had been saved as well.His mind moved on to the incident at the corner of the bar of theParthenon, when the young athlete had turned his hand down.  He was nolonger stunned by the event, but he was shocked and grieved, as only astrong man can be, at this passing of his strength.  And the issue wastoo clear for him to dodge, even with himself.  He knew why his handhad gone down.  Not because he was an old man.  He was just in thefirst flush of his prime, and, by rights, it was the hand of thehammer-thrower which should have gone down.  Daylight knew that he hadtaken liberties with himself.  He had always looked upon this strengthof his as permanent, and here, for years, it had been steadily oozingfrom him.  As he had diagnosed it, he had come in from under the starsto roost in the coops of cities.  He had almost forgotten how to walk.He had lifted up his feet and been ridden around in automobiles, cabsand carriages, and electric cars.  He had not exercised, and he haddry-rotted his muscles with alcohol.And was it worth it?  What did all his money mean after all? Dede wasright.  It could buy him no more than one bed at a time, and at thesame time it made him the abjectest of slaves.  It tied him fast.  Hewas tied by it right now.  Even if he so desired, he could not lie abedthis very day.  His money called him.  The office whistle would soonblow, and he must answer it. The early sunshine was streaming throughhis window--a fine day for a ride in the hills on Bob, with Dede besidehim on her Mab. Yet all his millions could not buy him this one day.One of those flurries might come along, and he had to be on the spot tomeet it.  Thirty millions!  And they were powerless to persuade Dede toride on Mab--Mab, whom he had bought, and who was unused and growingfat on pasture.  What were thirty millions when they could not buy aman a ride with the girl he loved?  Thirty millions!--that made himcome here and go there, that rode upon him like so many millstones,that destroyed him while they grew, that put their foot down andprevented him from winning this girl who worked for ninety dollars amonth.Which was better?  he asked himself.  All this was Dede's own thought.It was what she had meant when she prayed he would go broke.  He heldup his offending right arm.  It wasn't the same old arm.  Of course shecould not love that arm and that body as she had loved the strong,clean arm and body of years before.  He didn't like that arm and bodyhimself.  A young whippersnapper had been able to take liberties withit.  It had gone back on him.  He sat up suddenly.  No, by God, he hadgone back on it! He had gone back on himself.  He had gone back onDede.  She was right, a thousand times right, and she had sense enoughto know it, sense enough to refuse to marry a money slave with awhiskey-rotted carcass.He got out of bed and looked at himself in the long mirror on thewardrobe door.  He wasn't pretty.  The old-time lean cheeks were gone.These were heavy, seeming to hang down by their own weight.  He lookedfor the lines of cruelty Dede had spoken of, and he found them, and hefound the harshness in the eyes as well, the eyes that were muddy nowafter all the cocktails of the night before, and of the months andyears before.  He looked at the clearly defined pouches that showedunder his eyes, and they've shocked him.  He rolled up the sleeve ofhis pajamas.  No wonder the hammer-thrower had put his hand down.Those weren't muscles.  A rising tide of fat had submerged them.  Hestripped off the pajama coat.  Again he was shocked, this time but thebulk of his body.  It wasn't pretty.  The lean stomach had become apaunch.  The ridged muscles of chest and shoulders and abdomen hadbroken down into rolls of flesh.He sat down on the bed, and through his mind drifted pictures of hisyouthful excellence, of the hardships he had endured over other men, ofthe Indians and dogs he had run off their legs in the heart-breakingdays and nights on the Alaskan trail, of the feats of strength that hadmade him king over a husky race of frontiersmen.And this was age.  Then there drifted across the field of vision of hismind's eye the old man he had encountered at Glen Ellen, corning up thehillside through the fires of sunset, white-headed and white-bearded,eighty-four, in his hand the pail of foaming milk and in his face allthe warm glow and content of the passing summer day.  That had beenage.  "Yes siree, eighty-four, and spryer than most," he could hear theold man say.  "And I ain't loafed none. I walked across the Plains withan ox-team and fit Injuns in '51, and I was a family man then withseven youngsters."Next he remembered the old woman of the chaparral, pressing grapes inher mountain clearing; and Ferguson, the little man who had scuttledinto the road like a rabbit, the one-time managing editor of a greatnewspaper, who was content to live in the chaparral along with hisspring of mountain water and his hand-reared and manicured fruit trees.Ferguson had solved a problem.  A weakling and an alcoholic, he had runaway from the doctors and the chicken-coop of a city, and soaked uphealth like a thirsty sponge.  Well, Daylight pondered, if a sick manwhom the doctors had given up could develop into a healthy farmlaborer, what couldn't a merely stout man like himself do under similarcircumstances?  He caught a vision of his body with all its youthfulexcellence returned, and thought of Dede, and sat down suddenly on thebed, startled by the greatness of the idea that had come to him.He did not sit long.  His mind, working in its customary way, like asteel trap, canvassed the idea in all its bearings.  It was big--biggerthan anything he had faced before.  And he faced it squarely, picked itup in his two hands and turned it over and around and looked at it.The simplicity of it delighted him.  He chuckled over it, reached hisdecision, and began to dress. Midway in the dressing he stopped inorder to use the telephone.Dede was the first he called up."Don't come to the office this morning," he said.  "I'm coming out tosee you for a moment."  He called up others.  He ordered his motor-car.To Jones he gave instructions for the forwarding of Bob and Wolf toGlen Ellen.  Hegan he surprised by asking him to look up the deed ofthe Glen Ellen ranch and make out a new one in Dede Mason's name."Who?" Hegan demanded.  "Dede Mason," Daylight replied imperturbablythe 'phone must be indistinct this morning.  "D-e-d-e M-a-s o-n.  Gotit?"Half an hour later he was flying out to Berkeley.  And for the firsttime the big red car halted directly before the house. Dede offered toreceive him in the parlor, but he shook his head and nodded toward herrooms."In there," he said.  "No other place would suit."As the door closed, his arms went out and around her.  Then he stoodwith his hands on her shoulders and looking down into her face."Dede, if I tell you, flat and straight, that I'm going up to live onthat ranch at Glen Ellen, that I ain't taking a cent with me, that I'mgoing to scratch for every bite I eat, and that I ain't going to playary a card at the business game again, will you come along with me?"She gave a glad little cry, and he nestled her in closely.  But thenext moment she had thrust herself out from him to the old position atarm's length."I--I don't understand," she said breathlessly."And you ain't answered my proposition, though I guess no answer isnecessary.  We're just going to get married right away and start.  I'vesent Bob and Wolf along already.  When will you be ready?"Dede could not forbear to smile.  "My, what a hurricane of a man it is.I'm quite blown away.  And you haven't explained a word to me."Daylight smiled responsively."Look here, Dede, this is what card-sharps call a show-down.  No morephilandering and frills and long-distance sparring between you and me.We're just going to talk straight out in meeting--the truth, the wholetruth, and nothing but the truth.  Now you answer some questions forme, and then I'll answer yours."He paused.  "Well, I've got only one question after all: Do you love meenough to marry me?""But--" she began."No buts," he broke in sharply.  "This is a show-down.  When I saymarry, I mean what I told you at first, that we'd go up and live on theranch.  Do you love me enough for that?"She looked at him for a moment, then her lids dropped, and all of herseemed to advertise consent."Come on, then, let's start."  The muscles of his legs tensedinvoluntarily as if he were about to lead her to the door.  "My auto'swaiting outside.  There's nothing to delay excepting getting on yourhat."He bent over her. "I reckon it's allowable," he said, as he kissed her.It was a long embrace, and she was the first to speak."You haven't answered my questions.  How is this possible?  How can youleave your business?  Has anything happened?""No, nothing's happened yet, but it's going to, blame quick. I've takenyour preaching to heart, and I've come to the penitent form.  You aremy Lord God, and I'm sure going to serve you.  The rest can go tothunder.  You were sure right.  I've been the slave to my money, andsince I can't serve two masters I'm letting the money slide.  I'dsooner have you than all the money in the world, that's all."  Again heheld her closely in his arms.  "And I've sure got you, Dede.  I've suregot you."And I want to tell you a few more.  I've taken my last drink. You'remarrying a whiskey-soak, but your husband won't be that. He's going togrow into another man so quick you won't know him. A couple of monthsfrom now, up there in Glen Ellen, you'll wake up some morning and findyou've got a perfect stranger in the house with you, and you'll have toget introduced to him all over again.  You'll say, 'I'm Mrs. Harnish,who are you?' And I'll say, 'I'm Elam Harnish's younger brother.  I'vejust arrived from Alaska to attend the funeral.' 'What funeral?' you'llsay.  And I'll say, 'Why, the funeral of that good-for-nothing,gambling, whiskey-drinking Burning Daylight--the man that died of fattydegeneration of the heart from sitting in night and day at the businessgame 'Yes ma'am,' I'll say, 'he's sure a gone 'coon, but I've come totake his place and make you happy.  And now, ma'am, if you'll allow me,I'll just meander down to the pasture and milk the cow while you'regetting breakfast.'"Again he caught her hand and made as if to start with her for the door.When she resisted, he bent and kissed her again and again."I'm sure hungry for you, little woman," he murmured "You make thirtymillions look like thirty cents.""Do sit down and be sensible," she urged, her cheeks flushed, thegolden light in her eyes burning more golden than he had ever seen itbefore.But Daylight was bent on having his way, and when he sat down it waswith her beside him and his arm around her."'Yes, ma'am,' I'll say, 'Burning Daylight was a pretty good cuss, butit's better that he's gone.  He quit rolling up in his rabbit-skins andsleeping in the snow, and went to living in a chicken-coop.  He liftedup his legs and quit walking and working, and took to existing onMartini cocktails and Scotch whiskey.  He thought he loved you, ma'am,and he did his best, but he loved his cocktails more, and he loved hismoney more, and himself more, and 'most everything else more than hedid you.' And then I'll say, 'Ma'am, you just run your eyes over me andsee how different I am.  I ain't got a cocktail thirst, and all themoney I got is a dollar and forty cents and I've got to buy a new ax,the last one being plumb wore out, and I can love you just about eleventimes as much as your first husband did.  You see, ma'am, he went allto fat.  And there ain't ary ounce of fat on me.' And I'll roll up mysleeve and show you, and say, 'Mrs. Harnish, after having experiencewith being married to that old fat money-bags, do you-all mind marryinga slim young fellow like me?' And you'll just wipe a tear away for poorold Daylight, and kind of lean toward me with a willing expression inyour eye, and then I'll blush maybe some, being a young fellow, and putmy arm around you, like that, and then--why, then I'll up and marry mybrother's widow, and go out and do the chores while she's cooking abite to eat.""But you haven't answered my questions," she reproached him, as sheemerged, rosy and radiant, from the embrace that had accompanied theculmination of his narrative."Now just what do you want to know?" he asked."I want to know how all this is possible?  How you are able to leaveyour business at a time like this?  What you meant by saying thatsomething was going to happen quickly?  I--" She hesitated and blushed."I answered your question, you know.""Let's go and get married," he urged, all the whimsicality of hisutterance duplicated in his eyes.  "You know I've got to make way forthat husky young brother of mine, and I ain't got long to live."  Shemade an impatient moue, and he continued seriously."You see, it's like this, Dede.  I've been working like forty horsesever since this blamed panic set in, and all the time some of thoseideas you'd given me were getting ready to sprout. Well, they sproutedthis morning, that's all.  I started to get up, expecting to go to theoffice as usual.  But I didn't go to the office.  All that sproutingtook place there and then.  The sun was shining in the window, and Iknew it was a fine day in the hills.  And I knew I wanted to ride inthe hills with you just about thirty million times more than I wantedto go to the office.  And I knew all the time it was impossible.  Andwhy? Because of the office.  The office wouldn't let me.  All my moneyreared right up on its hind legs and got in the way and wouldn't letme.  It's a way that blamed money has of getting in the way. You knowthat yourself."And then I made up my mind that I was to the dividing of the ways.One way led to the office.  The other way led to Berkeley. And I tookthe Berkeley road.  I'm never going to set foot in the office again.That's all gone, finished, over and done with, and I'm letting it slideclean to smash and then some.  My mind's set on this.  You see, I'vegot religion, and it's sure the old-time religion; it's love and you,and it's older than the oldest religion in the world.  It's IT, that'swhat it is--IT, with a capital I-T."She looked at him with a sudden, startled expression."You mean--?" she began."I mean just that.  I'm wiping the slate clean.  I'm letting it all goto smash.  When them thirty million dollars stood up to my face andsaid I couldn't go out with you in the hills to-day, I knew the timehad come for me to put my foot down.  And I'm putting it down.  I'vegot you, and my strength to work for you, and that little ranch inSonoma.  That's all I want, and that's all I'm going to save out, alongwith Bob and Wolf, a suit case and a hundred and forty hair bridles.All the rest goes, and good riddance.  It's that much junk."But Dede was insistent."Then this--this tremendous loss is all unnecessary?" she asked."Just what I haven't been telling you.  It IS necessary.  If that moneythinks it can stand up right to my face and say I can't go riding withyou--""No, no; be serious," Dede broke in.  "I don't mean that, and you knowit.  What I want to know is, from a standpoint of business, is thisfailure necessary?"He shook his head."You bet it isn't necessary.  That's the point of it.  I'm not lettinggo of it because I'm licked to a standstill by the panic and have gotto let go.  I'm firing it out when I've licked the panic and amwinning, hands down.  That just shows how little I think of it.  It'syou that counts, little woman, and I make my play accordingly."But she drew away from his sheltering arms."You are mad, Elam.""Call me that again," he murmured ecstatically.  "It's sure sweeterthan the chink of millions."All this she ignored."It's madness.  You don't know what you are doing--""Oh, yes, I do," he assured her.  "I'm winning the dearest wish of myheart.  Why, your little finger is worth more--""Do be sensible for a moment.""I was never more sensible in my life.  I know what I want, and I'mgoing to get it.  I want you and the open air.  I want to get my footoff the paving-stones and my ear away from the telephone. I want alittle ranch-house in one of the prettiest bits of country God evermade, and I want to do the chores around that ranch-house--milk cows,and chop wood, and curry horses, and plough the ground, and all therest of it; and I want you there in the ranch-house with me.  I'm plumbtired of everything else, and clean wore out.  And I'm sure theluckiest man alive, for I've got what money can't buy.  I've got you,and thirty millions couldn't buy you, nor three thousand millions, northirty cents--"A knock at the door interrupted him, and he was left to staredelightedly at the Crouched Venus and on around the room at Dede'sdainty possessions, while she answered the telephone."It is Mr. Hegan," she said, on returning.  "He is holding the line.He says it is important."Daylight shook his head and smiled."Please tell Mr. Hegan to hang up.  I'm done with the office and Idon't want to hear anything about anything."A minute later she was back again."He refuses to hang up.  He told me to tell you that Unwin is in theoffice now, waiting to see you, and Harrison, too.  Mr. Hegan said thatGrimshaw and Hodgkins are in trouble.  That it looks as if they aregoing to break.  And he said something about protection."It was startling information.  Both Unwin and Harrison represented bigbanking corporations, and Daylight knew that if the house of Grimshawand Hodgkins went it would precipitate a number of failures and start aflurry of serious dimensions.  But Daylight smiled, and shook his head,and mimicked the stereotyped office tone of voice as he said:--"Miss Mason, you will kindly tell Mr. Hegan that there is nothing doingand to hang up.""But you can't do this," she pleaded."Watch me," he grimly answered."Elam!""Say it again," he cried.  "Say it again, and a dozen Grimshaws andHodgkins can smash!"He caught her by the hand and drew her to him."You let Hegan hang on to that line till he's tired.  We can't bewasting a second on him on a day like this.  He's only in love withbooks and things, but I've got a real live woman in my arms that'sloving me all the time she's kicking over the traces."CHAPTER XXIII"But I know something of the fight you have been making," Dedecontended.  "If you stop now, all the work you have done, everything,will be destroyed.  You have no right to do it.  You can't do it."Daylight was obdurate.  He shook his head and smiled tantalizingly."Nothing will be destroyed, Dede, nothing.  You don't understand thisbusiness game.  It's done on paper.  Don't you see?  Where's the gold Idug out of Klondike?  Why, it's in twenty-dollar gold pieces, in goldwatches, in wedding rings.  No matter what happens to me, thetwenty-dollar pieces, the watches, and the wedding rings remain.Suppose I died right now.  It wouldn't affect the gold one iota.  It'ssure the same with this present situation.  All I stand for is paper.I've got the paper for thousands of acres of land.  All right.  Burn upthe paper, and burn me along with it.  The land remains, don't it?  Therain falls on it, the seeds sprout in it, the trees grow out of it, thehouses stand on it, the electric cars run over it.  It's paper thatbusiness is run on.  I lose my paper, or I lose my life, it's all thesame; it won't alter one grain of sand in all that land, or twist oneblade of grass around sideways."Nothing is going to be lost--not one pile out of the docks, not onerailroad spike, not one ounce of steam out of the gauge of aferry-boat.  The cars will go on running, whether I hold the paper orsomebody else holds it.  The tide has set toward Oakland.  People arebeginning to pour in.  We're selling building lots again.  There is nostopping that tide.  No matter what happens to me or the paper, themthree hundred thousand folks are coming in the same.  And there'll becars to carry them around, and houses to hold them, and good water forthem to drink and electricity to give them light, and all the rest."By this time Hegan had arrived in an automobile.  The honk of it camein through the open window, and they saw, it stop alongside the big redmachine.  In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with thechauffeur."I'll see Hegan," Daylight told Dede.  "There's no need for the rest.They can wait in the machine.""Is he drunk?" Hegan whispered to Dede at the door.She shook her head and showed him in."Good morning, Larry," was Daylight's greeting.  "Sit down and restyour feet.  You sure seem to be in a flutter.""I am," the little Irishman snapped back.  "Grimshaw and Hodgkins aregoing to smash if something isn't done quick.  Why didn't you come tothe office?  What are you going to do about it?""Nothing," Daylight drawled lazily.  "Except let them smash, I guess--""But--""I've had no dealings with Grimshaw and Hodgkins.  I don't owe themanything.  Besides, I'm going to smash myself.  Look here, Larry, youknow me.  You know when I make up my mind I mean it. Well, I've suremade up my mind.  I'm tired of the whole game. I'm letting go of it asfast as I can, and a smash is the quickest way to let go."Hegan stared at his chief, then passed his horror-stricken gaze on toDede, who nodded in sympathy."So let her smash, Larry," Daylight went on.  "All you've got to do isto protect yourself and all our friends.  Now you listen to me while Itell you what to do.  Everything is in good shape to do it.  Nobodymust get hurt.  Everybody that stood by me must come through withoutdamage.  All the back wages and salaries must be paid pronto.  All themoney I've switched away from the water company, the street cars, andthe ferries must be switched back.  And you won't get hurt yourselfnone.  Every company you got stock in will come through--""You are crazy, Daylight!" the little lawyer cried out.  "This is allbabbling lunacy.  What is the matter with you?  You haven't been eatinga drug or something?""I sure have!" Daylight smiled reply.  "And I'm now coughing it up.I'm sick of living in a city and playing business--I'm going off to thesunshine, and the country, and the green grass.  And Dede, here, isgoing with me.  So you've got the chance to be the first tocongratulate me.""Congratulate the--the devil!" Hegan spluttered.  "I'm not going tostand for this sort of foolishness.""Oh, yes, you are; because if you don't there'll be a bigger smash andsome folks will most likely get hurt.  You're worth a million or moreyourself, now, and if you listen to me you come through with a wholeskin.  I want to get hurt, and get hurt to the limit.  That's what I'mlooking for, and there's no man or bunch of men can get between me andwhat I'm looking for. Savvee, Hegan?  Savvee?""What have you done to him?" Hegan snarled at Dede."Hold on there, Larry."  For the first time Daylight's voice was sharp,while all the old lines of cruelty in his face stood forth.  "MissMason is going to be my wife, and while I don't mind your talking toher all you want, you've got to use a different tone of voice or you'llbe heading for a hospital, which will sure be an unexpected sort ofsmash.  And let me tell you one other thing.  This-all is my doing.She says I'm crazy, too."Hegan shook his head in speechless sadness and continued to stare."There'll be temporary receiverships, of course," Daylight advised;"but they won't bother none or last long.  What you must do immediatelyis to save everybody--the men that have been letting their wages ridewith me, all the creditors, and all the concerns that have stood by.There's the wad of land that New Jersey crowd has been dickering for.They'll take all of a couple of thousand acres and will close now ifyou give them half a chance.  That Fairmount section is the cream ofit, and they'll dig up as high as a thousand dollars an acre for a partof it. That'll help out some.  That five-hundred acre tract beyond,you'll be lucky if they pay two hundred an acre."Dede, who had been scarcely listening, seemed abruptly to make up hermind, and stepped forward where she confronted the two men. Her facewas pale, but set with determination, so that Daylight, looking at it,was reminded of the day when she first rode Bob."Wait," she said.  "I want to say something.  Elam, if you do thisinsane thing, I won't marry you.  I refuse to marry you."Hegan, in spite of his misery, gave her a quick, grateful look."I'll take my chance on that," Daylight began."Wait!" she again interrupted.  "And if you don't do this thing, I willmarry you.""Let me get this proposition clear."  Daylight spoke with exasperatingslowness and deliberation.  "As I understand it, if I keep right on atthe business game, you'll sure marry me? You'll marry me if I keep onworking my head off and drinking Martinis?"After each question he paused, while she nodded an affirmation."And you'll marry me right away?""Yes.""To-day?  Now?""Yes."He pondered for a moment."No, little woman, I won't do it.  It won't work, and you know ityourself.  I want you--all of you; and to get it I'll have to give youall of myself, and there'll be darn little of myself left over to giveif I stay with the business game.  Why, Dede, with you on the ranchwith me, I'm sure of you--and of myself. I'm sure of you, anyway.  Youcan talk will or won't all you want, but you're sure going to marry mejust the same.  And now, Larry, you'd better be going.  I'll be at thehotel in a little while, and since I'm not going a step into the officeagain, bring all papers to sign and the rest over to my rooms.  And youcan get me on the 'phone there any time.  This smash is going through.Savvee?  I'm quit and done."He stood up as a sign for Hegan to go.  The latter was plainly stunned.He also rose to his feet, but stood looking helplessly around."Sheer, downright, absolute insanity," he muttered.Daylight put his hand on the other's shoulder."Buck up, Larry.  You're always talking about the wonders of humannature, and here I am giving you another sample of it and you ain'tappreciating it.  I'm a bigger dreamer than you are, that's all, andI'm sure dreaming what's coming true.  It's the biggest, best dream Iever had, and I'm going after it to get it--""By losing all you've got," Hegan exploded at him."Sure--by losing all I've got that I don't want.  But I'm hanging on tothem hundred and forty hair bridles just the same. Now you'd betterhustle out to Unwin and Harrison and get on down town.  I'll be at thehotel, and you can call me up any time."He turned to Dede as soon as Hegan was gone, and took her by the hand."And now, little woman, you needn't come to the office any more.Consider yourself discharged.  And remember I was your employer, soyou've got to come to me for recommendation, and if you're not realgood, I won't give you one.  In the meantime, you just rest up andthink about what things you want to pack, because we'll just about haveto set up housekeeping on your stuff--leastways, the front part of thehouse.""But, Elam, I won't, I won't! If you do this mad thing I never willmarry you."She attempted to take her hand away, but he closed on it with aprotecting, fatherly clasp."Will you be straight and honest?  All right, here goes.  Which wouldyou sooner have--me and the money, or me and the ranch?""But--" she began."No buts.  Me and the money?"She did not answer."Me and the ranch?"Still she did not answer, and still he was undisturbed."You see, I know your answer, Dede, and there's nothing more to say.Here's where you and I quit and hit the high places for Sonoma.  Youmake up your mind what you want to pack, and I'll have some men outhere in a couple of days to do it for you.  It will be about the lastwork anybody else ever does for us.  You and I will do the unpackingand the arranging ourselves."She made a last attempt."Elam, won't you be reasonable?  There is time to reconsider.  I cantelephone down and catch Mr. Hegan as soon as he reaches the office--""Why, I'm the only reasonable man in the bunch right now," he rejoined."Look at me--as calm as you please, and as happy as a king, whilethey're fluttering around like a lot of cranky hens whose heads areliable to be cut off.""I'd cry, if I thought it would do any good," she threatened."In which case I reckon I'd have to hold you in my arms some more andsort of soothe you down," he threatened back.  "And now I'm going togo.  It's too bad you got rid of Mab.  You could have sent her up tothe ranch.  But see you've got a mare to ride of some sort or other."As he stood at the top of the steps, leaving, she said:--"You needn't send those men.  There will be no packing, because I amnot going to marry you.""I'm not a bit scared," he answered, and went down the steps.CHAPTER XXIVThree days later, Daylight rode to Berkeley in his red car.  It was forthe last time, for on the morrow the big machine passed into another'spossession.  It had been a strenuous three days, for his smash had beenthe biggest the panic had precipitated in California.  The papers hadbeen filled with it, and a great cry of indignation had gone up fromthe very men who later found that Daylight had fully protected theirinterests.  It was these facts, coming slowly to light, that gave riseto the widely repeated charge that Daylight had gone insane.  It wasthe unanimous conviction among business men that no sane man couldpossibly behave in such fashion.  On the other hand, neither hisprolonged steady drinking nor his affair with Dede became public, sothe only conclusion attainable was that the wild financier from Alaskahad gone lunatic.  And Daylight had grinned and confirmed the suspicionby refusing to see the reporters.He halted the automobile before Dede's door, and met her with his samerushing tactics, enclosing her in his arms before a word could beuttered.  Not until afterward, when she had recovered herself from himand got him seated, did he begin to speak."I've done it," he announced.  "You've seen the newspapers, of course.I'm plumb cleaned out, and I've just called around to find out what dayyou feel like starting for Glen Ellen.  It'll have to be soon, for it'sreal expensive living in Oakland these days.  My board at the hotel isonly paid to the end of the week, and I can't afford to stay afterthat.  And beginning with to-morrow I've got to use the street cars,and they sure eat up the nickels."He paused, and waited, and looked at her.  Indecision and troubleshowed on her face.  Then the smile he knew so well began to grow onher lips and in her eyes, until she threw back her head and laughed inthe old forthright boyish way."When are those men coming to pack for me?" she asked.And again she laughed and simulated a vain attempt to escape hisbearlike arms."Dear Elam," she whispered; "dear Elam."  And of herself, for the firsttime, she kissed him.She ran her hand caressingly through his hair."Your eyes are all gold right now," he said.  "I can look in them andtell just how much you love me.""They have been all gold for you, Elam, for a long time.  I think, onour little ranch, they will always be all gold.""Your hair has gold in it, too, a sort of fiery gold."  He turned herface suddenly and held it between his hands and looked long into hereyes.  "And your eyes were full of gold only the other day, when yousaid you wouldn't marry me."She nodded and laughed."You would have your will," she confessed.  "But I couldn't be a partyto such madness.  All that money was yours, not mine.  But I was lovingyou all the time, Elam, for the great big boy you are, breaking thethirty-million toy with which you had grown tired of playing.  And whenI said no, I knew all the time it was yes.  And I am sure that my eyeswere golden all the time.  I had only one fear, and that was that youwould fail to lose everything.  Because, dear, I knew I should marryyou anyway, and I did so want just you and the ranch and Bob and Wolfand those horse-hair bridles.  Shall I tell you a secret?  As soon asyou left, I telephoned the man to whom I sold Mab."She hid her face against his breast for an instant, and then looked athim again, gladly radiant."You see, Elam, in spite of what my lips said, my mind was made upthen.  I--I simply had to marry you.  But I was praying you wouldsucceed in losing everything.  And so I tried to find what had becomeof Mab.  But the man had sold her and did not know what had become ofher.  You see, I wanted to ride with you over the Glen Ellen hills, onMab and you on Bob, just as I had ridden with you through the Piedmonthills."The disclosure of Mab's whereabouts trembled on Daylight's lips, but heforbore."I'll promise you a mare that you'll like just as much as Mab," he said.But Dede shook her head, and on that one point refused to be comforted."Now, I've got an idea," Daylight said, hastening to get theconversation on less perilous ground.  "We're running away from cities,and you have no kith nor kin, so it don't seem exactly right that weshould start off by getting married in a city.  So here's the idea:I'll run up to the ranch and get things in shape around the house andgive the caretaker his walking-papers.  You follow me in a couple ofdays, coming on the morning train.  I'll have the preacher fixed andwaiting.  And here's another idea. You bring your riding togs in a suitcase.  And as soon as the ceremony's over, you can go to the hotel andchange.  Then out you come, and you find me waiting with a couple ofhorses, and we'll ride over the landscape so as you can see theprettiest parts of the ranch the first thing.  And she's sure pretty,that ranch.  And now that it's settled, I'll be waiting for you at themorning train day after to-morrow."Dede blushed as she spoke."You are such a hurricane.""Well, ma'am," he drawled, "I sure hate to burn daylight. And you and Ihave burned a heap of daylight.  We've been scandalously extravagant.We might have been married years ago."Two days later, Daylight stood waiting outside the little Glen Ellenhotel.  The ceremony was over, and he had left Dede to go inside andchange into her riding-habit while he brought the horses.  He held themnow, Bob and Mab, and in the shadow of the watering-trough Wolf lay andlooked on.  Already two days of ardent California sun had touched withnew fires the ancient bronze in Daylight's face.  But warmer still wasthe glow that came into his cheeks and burned in his eyes as he sawDede coming out the door, riding-whip in hand, clad in the familiarcorduroy skirt and leggings of the old Piedmont days.  There was warmthand glow in her own face as she answered his gaze and glanced on pasthim to the horses.  Then she saw Mab.  But her gaze leaped back to theman."Oh, Elam!" she breathed.It was almost a prayer, but a prayer that included a thousand meaningsDaylight strove to feign sheepishness, but his heart was singing toowild a song for mere playfulness.  All things had been in the naming ofhis name--reproach, refined away by gratitude, and all compounded ofjoy and love.She stepped forward and caressed the mare, and again turned and lookedat the man, and breathed:--"Oh, Elam!"And all that was in her voice was in her eyes, and in them Daylightglimpsed a profundity deeper and wider than any speech or thought--thewhole vast inarticulate mystery and wonder of sex and love.Again he strove for playfulness of speech, but it was too great amoment for even love fractiousness to enter in.  Neither spoke. Shegathered the reins, and, bending, Daylight received her foot in hishand.  She sprang, as he lifted and gained the saddle. The next momenthe was mounted and beside her, and, with Wolf sliding along ahead inhis typical wolf-trot, they went up the hill that led out of town--twolovers on two chestnut sorrel steeds, riding out and away to honeymoonthrough the warm summer day.  Daylight felt himself drunken as withwine.  He was at the topmost pinnacle of life.  Higher than this no mancould climb nor had ever climbed.  It was his day of days, hislove-time and his mating-time, and all crowned by this virginalpossession of a mate who had said "Oh, Elam," as she had said it, andlooked at him out of her soul as she had looked.They cleared the crest of the hill, and he watched the joy mount in herface as she gazed on the sweet, fresh land.  He pointed out the groupof heavily wooded knolls across the rolling stretches of ripe grain."They're ours," he said.  "And they're only a sample of the ranch.Wait till you see the big canon.  There are 'coons down there, and backhere on the Sonoma there are mink.  And deer!--why, that mountain'ssure thick with them, and I reckon we can scare up a mountain-lion ifwe want to real hard.  And, say, there's a little meadow--well, I ain'tgoing to tell you another word.  You wait and see for yourself."They turned in at the gate, where the road to the clay-pit crossed thefields, and both sniffed with delight as the warm aroma of the ripe hayrose in their nostrils.  As on his first visit, the larks were utteringtheir rich notes and fluttering up before the horses until the woodsand the flower-scattered glades were reached, when the larks gave wayto blue jays and woodpeckers."We're on our land now," he said, as they left the hayfield behind."It runs right across country over the roughest parts. Just you waitand see."As on the first day, he turned aside from the clay-pit and workedthrough the woods to the left, passing the first spring and jumping thehorses over the ruined remnants of the stake-and-rider fence.  Fromhere on, Dede was in an unending ecstasy.  By the spring that gurgledamong the redwoods grew another great wild lily, bearing on its slenderstalk the prodigious outburst of white waxen bells.  This time he didnot dismount, but led the way to the deep canon where the stream hadcut a passage among the knolls.  He had been at work here, and a steepand slippery horse trail now crossed the creek, so they rode up beyond,through the somber redwood twilight, and, farther on, through a tangledwood of oak and madrono.  They came to a small clearing of severalacres, where the grain stood waist high."Ours," Daylight said.She bent in her saddle, plucked a stalk of the ripe grain, and nibbledit between her teeth."Sweet mountain hay," she cried.  "The kind Mab likes."And throughout the ride she continued to utter cries and ejaculationsof surprise and delight."And you never told me all this!" she reproached him, as they lookedacross the little clearing and over the descending slopes of woods tothe great curving sweep of Sonoma Valley."Come," he said; and they turned and went back through the forestshade, crossed the stream and came to the lily by the spring.Here, also, where the way led up the tangle of the steep hill, he hadcut a rough horse trail.  As they forced their way up the zigzags, theycaught glimpses out and down through the sea of foliage.  Yet alwayswere their farthest glimpses stopped by the closing vistas of green,and, yet always, as they climbed, did the forest roof arch overhead,with only here and there rifts that permitted shattered shafts ofsunlight to penetrate.  And all about them were ferns, a score ofvarieties, from the tiny gold-backs and maidenhair to huge brakes sixand eight feet tall.Below them, as they mounted, they glimpsed great gnarled trunks andbranches of ancient trees, and above them were similar great gnarledbranches.Dede stopped her horse and sighed with the beauty of it all."It is as if we are swimmers," she said, "rising out of a deep pool ofgreen tranquillity.  Up above is the sky and the sun, but this is apool, and we are fathoms deep."They started their horses, but a dog-tooth violet, shouldering amongstthe maidenhair, caught her eye and made her rein in again.They cleared the crest and emerged from the pool as if into anotherworld, for now they were in the thicket of velvet-trunked youngmadronos and looking down the open, sun-washed hillside, across thenodding grasses, to the drifts of blue and white nemophilae thatcarpeted the tiny meadow on either side the tiny stream.  Dede clappedher hands."It's sure prettier than office furniture," Daylight remarked."It sure is," she answered.And Daylight, who knew his weakness in the use of the particular wordsure, knew that she had repeated it deliberately and with love.They crossed the stream and took the cattle track over the low rockyhill and through the scrub forest of manzanita, till they emerged onthe next tiny valley with its meadow-bordered streamlet."If we don't run into some quail pretty soon, I'll be surprised some,"Daylight said.And as the words left his lips there was a wild series of explosivethrumming as the old quail arose from all about Wolf, while the youngones scuttled for safety and disappeared miraculously before thespectators' very eyes.He showed her the hawk's nest he had found in the lightning-shatteredtop of the redwood, and she discovered a wood-rat's nest which he hadnot seen before.  Next they took the old wood-road and came out on thedozen acres of clearing where the wine grapes grew in the wine-coloredvolcanic soil.  Then they followed the cow-path through more woods andthickets and scattered glades, and dropped down the hillside to wherethe farm-house, poised on the lip of the big canon, came into view onlywhen they were right upon it.Dede stood on the wide porch that ran the length of the house whileDaylight tied the horses.  To Dede it was very quiet.  It was the dry,warm, breathless calm of California midday.  All the world seemeddozing.  From somewhere pigeons were cooing lazily. With a deep sigh ofsatisfaction, Wolf, who had drunk his fill at all the streams along theway, dropped down in the cool shadow of the porch.  She heard thefootsteps of Daylight returning, and caught her breath with a quickintake.  He took her hand in his, and, as he turned the door-knob, felther hesitate.  Then he put his arm around her; the door swung open, andtogether they passed in.CHAPTER XXVMany persons, themselves city-bred and city-reared, have fled to thesoil and succeeded in winning great happiness.  In such cases they havesucceeded only by going through a process of savage disillusionment.But with Dede and Daylight it was different. They had both been born onthe soil, and they knew its naked simplicities and rawer ways.  Theywere like two persons, after far wandering, who had merely come homeagain.  There was less of the unexpected in their dealings with nature,while theirs was all the delight of reminiscence.  What might appearsordid and squalid to the fastidiously reared, was to them eminentlywholesome and natural.  The commerce of nature was to them no unknownand untried trade.  They made fewer mistakes.  They already knew, andit was a joy to remember what they had forgotten.And another thing they learned was that it was easier for one who hasgorged at the flesh-pots to content himself with the meagerness of acrust, than for one who has known only the crust.Not that their life was meagre.  It was that they found keener delightsand deeper satisfactions in little things.  Daylight, who had playedthe game in its biggest and most fantastic aspects, found that here, onthe slopes of Sonoma Mountain, it was still the same old game.  Man hadstill work to perform, forces to combat, obstacles to overcome.  Whenhe experimented in a small way at raising a few pigeons for market, hefound no less zest in calculating in squabs than formerly when he hadcalculated in millions.  Achievement was no less achievement, while theprocess of it seemed more rational and received the sanction of hisreason.The domestic cat that had gone wild and that preyed on his pigeons, hefound, by the comparative standard, to be of no less paramount menacethan a Charles Klinkner in the field of finance, trying to raid him forseveral millions.  The hawks and weasels and 'coons were so manyDowsetts, Lettons, and Guggenhammers that struck at him secretly.  Thesea of wild vegetation that tossed its surf against the boundaries ofall his clearings and that sometimes crept in and flooded in a singleweek was no mean enemy to contend with and subdue.  His fat-soiledvegetable-garden in the nook of hills that failed of its best was aproblem of engrossing importance, and when he had solved it by puttingin drain-tile, the joy of the achievement was ever with him.  He neverworked in it and found the soil unpacked and tractable withoutexperiencing the thrill of accomplishment.There was the matter of the plumbing.  He was enabled to purchase thematerials through a lucky sale of a number of his hair bridles.  Thework he did himself, though more than once he was forced to call inDede to hold tight with a pipe-wrench.  And in the end, when thebath-tub and the stationary tubs were installed and in working order,he could scarcely tear himself away from the contemplation of what hishands had wrought.  The first evening, missing him, Dede sought andfound him, lamp in hand, staring with silent glee at the tubs.  Herubbed his hand over their smooth wooden lips and laughed aloud, andwas as shamefaced as any boy when she caught him thus secretly exultingin his own prowess.It was this adventure in wood-working and plumbing that brought aboutthe building of the little workshop, where he slowly gathered acollection of loved tools.  And he, who in the old days, out of hismillions, could purchase immediately whatever he might desire, learnedthe new joy of the possession that follows upon rigid economy anddesire long delayed.  He waited three months before daring theextravagance of a Yankee screw-driver, and his glee in the marvelouslittle mechanism was so keen that Dede conceived forthright a greatidea.  For six months she saved her egg-money, which was hers by rightof allotment, and on his birthday presented him with a turning-lathe ofwonderful simplicity and multifarious efficiencies.  And their mutualdelight in the tool, which was his, was only equalled by their delightin Mab's first foal, which was Dede's special private property.It was not until the second summer that Daylight built the hugefireplace that outrivalled Ferguson's across the valley.  For all thesethings took time, and Dede and Daylight were not in a hurry.  Theirswas not the mistake of the average city-dweller who flees inultra-modern innocence to the soil.  They did not essay too much.Neither did they have a mortgage to clear, nor did they desire wealth.They wanted little in the way of food, and they had no rent to pay.  Sothey planned unambiguously, reserving their lives for each other andfor the compensations of country-dwelling from which the averagecountry-dweller is barred.  From Ferguson's example, too, they profitedmuch.  Here was a man who asked for but the plainest fare; whoministered to his own simple needs with his own hands; who worked outas a laborer only when he needed money to buy books and magazines; andwho saw to it that the major portion of his waking time was forenjoyment.  He loved to loaf long afternoons in the shade with hisbooks or to be up with the dawn and away over the hills.On occasion he accompanied Dede and Daylight on deer hunts through thewild canons and over the rugged steeps of Hood Mountain, though moreoften Dede and Daylight were out alone. This riding was one of theirchief joys.  Every wrinkle and crease in the hills they explored, andthey came to know every secret spring and hidden dell in the wholesurrounding wall of the valley.  They learned all the trails andcow-paths; but nothing delighted them more than to essay the roughestand most impossible rides, where they were glad to crouch and crawlalong the narrowest deer-runs, Bob and Mab struggling and forcing theirway along behind.  Back from their rides they brought the seeds andbulbs of wild flowers to plant in favoring nooks on the ranch.  Alongthe foot trail which led down the side of the big canon to the intakeof the water-pipe, they established their fernery.  It was not a formalaffair, and the ferns were left to themselves.  Dede and Daylightmerely introduced new ones from time to time, changing them from onewild habitat to another.  It was the same with the wild lilac, whichDaylight had sent to him from Mendocino County.  It became part of thewildness of the ranch, and, after being helped for a season, was leftto its own devices they used to gather the seeds of the Californiapoppy and scatter them over their own acres, so that the orange-coloredblossoms spangled the fields of mountain hay and prospered in flamingdrifts in the fence corners and along the edges of the clearings.Dede, who had a fondness for cattails, established a fringe of themalong the meadow stream, where they were left to fight it out with thewater-cress.  And when the latter was threatened with extinction,Daylight developed one of the shaded springs into his water-cressgarden and declared war upon any invading cattail.  On her wedding dayDede had discovered a long dog-tooth violet by the zigzag trail abovethe redwood spring, and here she continued to plant more and more.  Theopen hillside above the tiny meadow became a colony of Mariposa lilies.This was due mainly to her efforts, while Daylight, who rode with ashort-handled ax on his saddle-bow, cleared the little manzanita woodon the rocky hill of all its dead and dying and overcrowded weaklings.They did not labor at these tasks.  Nor were they tasks.  Merely inpassing, they paused, from time to time, and lent a hand to nature.These flowers and shrubs grew of themselves, and their presence was noviolation of the natural environment.  The man and the woman made noeffort to introduce a flower or shrub that did not of its own rightbelong.  Nor did they protect them from their enemies.  The horses andthe colts and the cows and the calves ran at pasture among them or overthem, and flower or shrub had to take its chance.  But the beasts werenot noticeably destructive, for they were few in number and the ranchwas large.On the other hand, Daylight could have taken in fully a dozen horses topasture, which would have earned him a dollar and a half per head permonth.  But this he refused to do, because of the devastation suchclose pasturing would produce.Ferguson came over to celebrate the housewarming that followed theachievement of the great stone fireplace.  Daylight had ridden acrossthe valley more than once to confer with him about the undertaking, andhe was the only other present at the sacred function of lighting thefirst fire.  By removing a partition, Daylight had thrown two roomsinto one, and this was the big living-room where Dede's treasures wereplaced--her books, and paintings and photographs, her piano, theCrouched Venus, the chafing-dish and all its glittering accessories.Already, in addition to her own wild-animal skins, were those of deerand coyote and one mountain-lion which Daylight had killed.  Thetanning he had done himself, slowly and laboriously, in frontierfashion.He handed the match to Dede, who struck it and lighted the fire. Thecrisp manzanita wood crackled as the flames leaped up and assailed thedry bark of the larger logs.  Then she leaned in the shelter of herhusband's arm, and the three stood and looked in breathless suspense.When Ferguson gave judgment, it was with beaming face and extended hand."She draws!  By crickey, she draws!" he cried.He shook Daylight's hand ecstatically, and Daylight shook his withequal fervor, and, bending, kissed Dede on the lips.  They were asexultant over the success of their simple handiwork as any greatcaptain at astonishing victory.  In Ferguson's eyes was actually asuspicious moisture while the woman pressed even more closely againstthe man whose achievement it was.  He caught her up suddenly in hisarms and whirled her away to the piano, crying out: "Come on, Dede! TheGloria! The Gloria!"And while the flames in the fireplace that worked, the triumphantstrains of the Twelfth Mass rolled forth.CHAPTER XXVIDaylight had made no assertion of total abstinence though he had nottaken a drink for months after the day he resolved to let his businessgo to smash.  Soon he proved himself strong enough to dare to take adrink without taking a second.  On the other hand, with his coming tolive in the country, had passed all desire and need for drink.  He feltno yearning for it, and even forgot that it existed.  Yet he refused tobe afraid of it, and in town, on occasion, when invited by thestorekeeper, would reply: "All right, son.  If my taking a drink willmake you happy here goes. Whiskey for mine."But such a drink began no desire for a second.  It made no impression.He was too profoundly strong to be affected by a thimbleful.  As he hadprophesied to Dede, Burning Daylight, the city financier, had died aquick death on the ranch, and his younger brother, the Daylight fromAlaska, had taken his place. The threatened inundation of fat hadsubsided, and all his old-time Indian leanness and of muscle hadreturned.  So, likewise, did the old slight hollows in his cheeks comeback. For him they indicated the pink of physical condition.  He becamethe acknowledged strong man of Sonoma Valley, the heaviest lifter andhardest winded among a husky race of farmer folk.  And once a year hecelebrated his birthday in the old-fashioned frontier way, challengingall the valley to come up the hill to the ranch and be put on its back.And a fair portion of the valley responded, brought the women-folk andchildren along, and picnicked for the day.At first, when in need of ready cash, he had followed Ferguson'sexample of working at day's labor; but he was not long in gravitatingto a form of work that was more stimulating and more satisfying, andthat allowed him even more time for Dede and the ranch and theperpetual riding through the hills.  Having been challenged by theblacksmith, in a spirit of banter, to attempt the breaking of a certainincorrigible colt, he succeeded so signally as to earn quite areputation as a horse-breaker.  And soon he was able to earn whatevermoney he desired at this, to him, agreeable work.A sugar king, whose breeding farm and training stables were atCaliente, three miles away, sent for him in time of need, and, beforethe year was out, offered him the management of the stables.  ButDaylight smiled and shook his head.  Furthermore, he refused toundertake the breaking of as many animals as were offered.  "I'm surenot going to die from overwork," he assured Dede; and he accepted suchwork only when he had to have money. Later, he fenced off a small runin the pasture, where, from time to time, he took in a limited numberof incorrigibles."We've got the ranch and each other," he told his wife, "and I'd soonerride with you to Hood Mountain any day than earn forty dollars.  Youcan't buy sunsets, and loving wives, and cool spring water, and suchfolderols, with forty dollars; and forty million dollars can't buy backfor me one day that I didn't ride with you to Hood Mountain."His life was eminently wholesome and natural.  Early to bed, he sleptlike an infant and was up with the dawn.  Always with something to do,and with a thousand little things that enticed but did not clamor, hewas himself never overdone.  Nevertheless, there were times when bothhe and Dede were not above confessing tiredness at bedtime afterseventy or eighty miles in the saddle.Sometimes, when he had accumulated a little money, and when the seasonfavored, they would mount their horses, with saddle-bags behind, andride away over the wall of the valley and down into the other valleys.When night fell, they put up at the first convenient farm or village,and on the morrow they would ride on, without definite plan, merelycontinuing to ride on, day after day, until their money gave out andthey were compelled to return.  On such trips they would be goneanywhere from a week to ten days or two weeks, and once they managed athree weeks' trip.They even planned ambitiously some day when they were disgracefullyprosperous, to ride all the way up to Daylight's boyhood home inEastern Oregon, stopping on the way at Dede's girlhood home inSiskiyou.  And all the joys of anticipation were theirs a thousandtimes as they contemplated the detailed delights of this grandadventure.One day, stopping to mail a letter at the Glen Ellen post office, theywere hailed by the blacksmith."Say, Daylight," he said, "a young fellow named Slosson sends you hisregards.  He came through in an auto, on the way to Santa Rosa.  Hewanted to know if you didn't live hereabouts, but the crowd with himwas in a hurry.  So he sent you his regards and said to tell you he'dtaken your advice and was still going on breaking his own record."Daylight had long since told Dede of the incident."Slosson?" he meditated, "Slosson?  That must be the hammer-thrower.He put my hand down twice, the young scamp." He turned suddenly toDede.  "Say, it's only twelve miles to Santa Rosa, and the horses arefresh."She divined what was in his mind, of which his twinkling eyes andsheepish, boyish grin gave sufficient advertisement, and she smiled andnodded acquiescence."We'll cut across by Bennett Valley," he said.  "It's nearer that way."There was little difficulty, once in Santa Rosa, of finding Slosson.He and his party had registered at the Oberlin Hotel, and Daylightencountered the young hammer-thrower himself in the office."Look here, son," Daylight announced, as soon as he had introducedDede, "I've come to go you another flutter at that hand game.  Here's alikely place."Slosson smiled and accepted.  The two men faced each other, the elbowsof their right arms on the counter, the hands clasped. Slosson's handquickly forced backward and down."You're the first man that ever succeeded in doing it," he said. "Let'stry it again.""Sure," Daylight answered.  "And don't forget, son, that you're thefirst man that put mine down.  That's why I lit out after you to-day."Again they clasped hands, and again Slosson's hand went down.  He was abroad-shouldered, heavy-muscled young giant, at least half a headtaller than Daylight, and he frankly expressed his chagrin and askedfor a third trial.  This time he steeled himself to the effort, and fora moment the issue was in doubt.  With flushed face and set teeth hemet the other's strength till his crackling muscles failed him.  Theair exploded sharply from his tensed lungs, as he relaxed in surrender,and the hand dropped limply down."You're too many for me," he confessed.  "I only hope you'll keep outof the hammer-throwing game."Daylight laughed and shook his head."We might compromise, and each stay in his own class.  You stick tohammer-throwing, and I'll go on turning down hands."But Slosson refused to accept defeat."Say," he called out, as Daylight and Dede, astride their horses, werepreparing to depart.  "Say--do you mind if I look you up next year?I'd like to tackle you again.""Sure, son.  You're welcome to a flutter any time.  Though I give youfair warning that you'll have to go some.  You'll have to train up, forI'm ploughing and chopping wood and breaking colts these days."Now and again, on the way home, Dede could hear her big boy-husbandchuckling gleefully.  As they halted their horses on the top of thedivide out of Bennett Valley, in order to watch the sunset, he rangedalongside and slipped his arm around her waist."Little woman," he said, "you're sure responsible for it all. And Ileave it to you, if all the money in creation is worth as much as onearm like that when it's got a sweet little woman like this to goaround."For of all his delights in the new life, Dede was his greatest. As heexplained to her more than once, he had been afraid of love all hislife only in the end to come to find it the greatest thing in theworld.  Not alone were the two well mated, but in coming to live on theranch they had selected the best soil in which their love wouldprosper.  In spite of her books and music, there was in her a wholesomesimplicity and love of the open and natural, while Daylight, in everyfiber of him, was essentially an open-air man.Of one thing in Dede, Daylight never got over marveling about, and thatwas her efficient hands--the hands that he had first seen taking downflying shorthand notes and ticking away at the typewriter; the handsthat were firm to hold a magnificent brute like Bob, that wonderfullyflashed over the keys of the piano, that were unhesitant in householdtasks, and that were twin miracles to caress and to run ripplingfingers through his hair. But Daylight was not unduly uxorious.  Helived his man's life just as she lived her woman's life.  There wasproper division of labor in the work they individually performed.  Butthe whole was entwined and woven into a fabric of mutual interest andconsideration.  He was as deeply interested in her cooking and hermusic as she was in his agricultural adventures in the vegetablegarden.  And he, who resolutely declined to die of overwork, saw to itthat she should likewise escape so dire a risk.In this connection, using his man's judgment and putting his man's footdown, he refused to allow her to be burdened with the entertaining ofguests.  For guests they had, especially in the warm, long summers, andusually they were her friends from the city, who were put to camp intents which they cared for themselves, and where, like true campers,they had also to cook for themselves.  Perhaps only in California,where everybody knows camp life, would such a program have beenpossible.  But Daylight's steadfast contention was that his wife shouldnot become cook, waitress, and chambermaid because she did not happento possess a household of servants.  On the other hand, chafing-dishsuppers in the big living-room for their camping guests were a commonhappening, at which times Daylight allotted them their chores and sawthat they were performed.  For one who stopped only for the night itwas different.  Likewise it was different with her brother, back fromGermany, and again able to sit a horse.  On his vacations he became thethird in the family, and to him was given the building of the fires,the sweeping, and the washing of the dishes.Daylight devoted himself to the lightening of Dede's labors, and it washer brother who incited him to utilize the splendid water-power of theranch that was running to waste.  It required Daylight's breaking ofextra horses to pay for the materials, and the brother devoted a threeweeks' vacation to assisting, and together they installed a Peltingwheel.  Besides sawing wood and turning his lathe and grindstone,Daylight connected the power with the churn; but his great triumph waswhen he put his arm around Dede's waist and led her out to inspect awashing-machine, run by the Pelton wheel, which really worked andreally washed clothes.Dede and Ferguson, between them, after a patient struggle, taughtDaylight poetry, so that in the end he might have been often seen,sitting slack in the saddle and dropping down the mountain trailsthrough the sun-flecked woods, chanting aloud Kipling's "Tomlinson,"or, when sharpening his ax, singing into the whirling grindstoneHenley's "Song of the Sword."  Not that he ever became consummatelyliterary in the way his two teachers were.  Beyond "Fra Lippo Lippi"and "Caliban and Setebos," he found nothing in Browning, while GeorgeMeredith was ever his despair.  It was of his own initiative, however,that he invested in a violin, and practised so assiduously that in timehe and Dede beguiled many a happy hour playing together after night hadfallen.So all went well with this well-mated pair.  Time never dragged. Therewere always new wonderful mornings and still cool twilights at the endof day; and ever a thousand interests claimed him, and his interestswere shared by her.  More thoroughly than he knew, had he come to acomprehension of the relativity of things.  In this new game he playedhe found in little things all the intensities of gratification anddesire that he had found in the frenzied big things when he was a powerand rocked half a continent with the fury of the blows he struck.  Withhead and hand, at risk of life and limb, to bit and break a wild coltand win it to the service of man, was to him no less great anachievement.  And this new table on which he played the game was clean.Neither lying, nor cheating, nor hypocrisy was here.  The other gamehad made for decay and death, while this new one made for cleanstrength and life.  And so he was content, with Dede at his side, towatch the procession of the days and seasons from the farm-houseperched on the canon-lip; to ride through crisp frosty mornings orunder burning summer suns; and to shelter in the big room where blazedthe logs in the fireplace he had built, while outside the worldshuddered and struggled in the storm-clasp of a southeaster.Once only Dede asked him if he ever regretted, and his answer was tocrush her in his arms and smother her lips with his.  His answer, aminute later, took speech."Little woman, even if you did cost thirty millions, you are sure thecheapest necessity of life I ever indulged in."  And then he added,"Yes, I do have one regret, and a monstrous big one, too.  I'd surelike to have the winning of you all over again. I'd like to go sneakingaround the Piedmont hills looking for you.  I'd like to meander intothose rooms of yours at Berkeley for the first time.  And there's nouse talking, I'm plumb soaking with regret that I can't put my armsaround you again that time you leaned your head on my breast and criedin the wind and rain."CHAPTER XXVIIBut there came the day, one year, in early April, when Dede sat in aneasy chair on the porch, sewing on certain small garments, whileDaylight read aloud to her.  It was in the afternoon, and a bright sunwas shining down on a world of new green.  Along the irrigationchannels of the vegetable garden streams of water were flowing, and nowand again Daylight broke off from his reading to run out and change theflow of water.  Also, he was teasingly interested in the certain smallgarments on which Dede worked, while she was radiantly happy over them,though at times, when his tender fun was too insistent, she was rosilyconfused or affectionately resentful.From where they sat they could look out over the world.  Like the curveof a skirting blade, the Valley of the Moon stretched before them,dotted with farm-houses and varied by pasture-lands, hay-fields, andvineyards.  Beyond rose the wall of the valley, every crease andwrinkle of which Dede and Daylight knew, and at one place, where thesun struck squarely, the white dump of the abandoned mine burned like ajewel.  In the foreground, in the paddock by the barn, was Mab, full ofpretty anxieties for the early spring foal that staggered about her ontottery legs.  The air shimmered with heat, and altogether it was alazy, basking day.  Quail whistled to their young from the thicketedhillside behind the house.  There was a gentle cooing of pigeons, andfrom the green depths of the big canon arose the sobbing wood note of amourning dove.  Once, there was a warning chorus from the foraging hensand a wild rush for cover, as a hawk, high in the blue, cast itsdrifting shadow along the ground.It was this, perhaps, that aroused old hunting memories in Wolf. At anyrate, Dede and Daylight became aware of excitement in the paddock, andsaw harmlessly reenacted a grim old tragedy of the Younger World.Curiously eager, velvet-footed and silent as a ghost, sliding andgliding and crouching, the dog that was mere domesticated wolf stalkedthe enticing bit of young life that Mab had brought so recently intothe world.  And the mare, her own ancient instincts aroused andquivering, circled ever between the foal and this menace of the wildyoung days when all her ancestry had known fear of him and his huntingbrethren.  Once, she whirled and tried to kick him, but usually shestrove to strike him with her fore-hoofs, or rushed upon him with openmouth and ears laid back in an effort to crunch his backbone betweenher teeth.  And the wolf-dog, with ears flattened down and crouching,would slide silkily away, only to circle up to the foal from the otherside and give cause to the mare for new alarm.  Then Daylight, urged onby Dede's solicitude, uttered a low threatening cry; and Wolf, droopingand sagging in all the body of him in token of his instant return toman's allegiance, slunk off behind the barn.It was a few minutes later that Daylight, breaking off from his readingto change the streams of irrigation, found that the water had ceasedflowing.  He shouldered a pick and shovel, took a hammer and apipe-wrench from the tool-house, and returned to Dede on the porch."I reckon I'll have to go down and dig the pipe out," he told her."It's that slide that's threatened all winter.  I guess she's come downat last.""Don't you read ahead, now," he warned, as he passed around the houseand took the trail that led down the wall of the canon.Halfway down the trail, he came upon the slide.  It was a small affair,only a few tons of earth and crumbling rock; but, starting from fiftyfeet above, it had struck the water pipe with force sufficient to breakit at a connection.  Before proceeding to work, he glanced up the pathof the slide, and he glanced with the eye of the earth-trained miner.And he saw what made his eyes startle and cease for the moment fromquesting farther."Hello," he communed aloud, "look who's here."His glance moved on up the steep broken surface, and across it fromside to side.  Here and there, in places, small twisted manzanitas wererooted precariously, but in the main, save for weeds and grass, thatportion of the canon was bare.  There were signs of a surface that hadshifted often as the rains poured a flow of rich eroded soil from aboveover the lip of the canon."A true fissure vein, or I never saw one," he proclaimed softly.And as the old hunting instincts had aroused that day in the wolf-dog,so in him recrudesced all the old hot desire of gold-hunting.  Droppingthe hammer and pipe-wrench, but retaining pick and shovel, he climbedup the slide to where a vague line of outputting but mostlysoil-covered rock could be seen.  It was all but indiscernible, but hispractised eye had sketched the hidden formation which it signified.Here and there, along this wall of the vein, he attacked the crumblingrock with the pick and shoveled the encumbering soil away.  Severaltimes he examined this rock.  So soft was some of it that he couldbreak it in his fingers.  Shifting a dozen feet higher up, he againattacked with pick and shovel.  And this time, when he rubbed the soilfrom a chunk of rock and looked, he straightened up suddenly, gaspingwith delight.  And then, like a deer at a drinking pool in fear of itsenemies, he flung a quick glance around to see if any eye were gazingupon him.  He grinned at his own foolishness and returned to hisexamination of the chunk.  A slant of sunlight fell on it, and it wasall aglitter with tiny specks of unmistakable free gold."From the grass roots down," he muttered in an awestricken voice, as heswung his pick into the yielding surface.He seemed to undergo a transformation.  No quart of cocktails had everput such a flame in his cheeks nor such a fire in his eyes. As heworked, he was caught up in the old passion that had ruled most of hislife.  A frenzy seized him that markedly increased from moment tomoment.  He worked like a madman, till he panted from his exertions andthe sweat dripped from his face to the ground.  He quested across theface of the slide to the opposite wall of the vein and back again.And, midway, he dug down through the red volcanic earth that had washedfrom the disintegrating hill above, until he uncovered quartz, rottenquartz, that broke and crumbled in his hands and showed to be alivewith free gold.Sometimes he started small slides of earth that covered up his work andcompelled him to dig again.  Once, he was swept fifty feet down thecanon-side; but he floundered and scrambled up again without pausingfor breath.  He hit upon quartz that was so rotten that it was almostlike clay, and here the gold was richer than ever.  It was a veritabletreasure chamber.  For a hundred feet up and down he traced the wallsof the vein.  He even climbed over the canon-lip to look along the browof the hill for signs of the outcrop.  But that could wait, and hehurried back to his find.He toiled on in the same mad haste, until exhaustion and an intolerableache in his back compelled him to pause.  He straightened up with evena richer piece of gold-laden quartz. Stooping, the sweat from hisforehead had fallen to the ground. It now ran into his eyes, blindinghim.  He wiped it from him with the back of his hand and returned to ascrutiny of the gold.It would run thirty thousand to the ton, fifty thousand, anything--heknew that.  And as he gazed upon the yellow lure, and panted for air,and wiped the sweat away, his quick vision leaped and set to work.  Hesaw the spur-track that must run up from the valley and across theupland pastures, and he ran the grades and built the bridge that wouldspan the canon, until it was real before his eyes.  Across the canonwas the place for the mill, and there he erected it; and he erected,also, the endless chain of buckets, suspended from a cable and operatedby gravity, that would carry the ore across the canon to thequartz-crusher. Likewise, the whole mine grew before him and beneathhim-tunnels, shafts, and galleries, and hoisting plants.  The blasts ofthe miners were in his ears, and from across the canon he could hearthe roar of the stamps.  The hand that held the lump of quartz wastrembling, and there was a tired, nervous palpitation apparently in thepit of his stomach.  It came to him abruptly that what he wanted was adrink--whiskey, cocktails, anything, a drink.  And even then, with thisnew hot yearning for the alcohol upon him, he heard, faint and far,drifting down the green abyss of the canon, Dede's voice, crying:--"Here, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick!  Here, chick, chick, chick!"He was astounded at the lapse of time.  She had left her sewing on theporch and was feeding the chickens preparatory to getting supper.  Theafternoon was gone.  He could not conceive that he had been away thatlong.Again came the call: "Here, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick! Here,chick, chick, chick!"It was the way she always called--first five, and then three.  He hadlong since noticed it.  And from these thoughts of her arose otherthoughts that caused a great fear slowly to grow in his face.  For itseemed to him that he had almost lost her.  Not once had he thought ofher in those frenzied hours, and for that much, at least, had she trulybeen lost to him.He dropped the piece of quartz, slid down the slide, and started up thetrail, running heavily.  At the edge of the clearing he eased down andalmost crept to a point of vantage whence he could peer out, himselfunseen.  She was feeding the chickens, tossing to them handfuls ofgrain and laughing at their antics.The sight of her seemed to relieve the panic fear into which he hadbeen flung, and he turned and ran back down the trail.  Again heclimbed the slide, but this time he climbed higher, carrying the pickand shovel with him.  And again he toiled frenziedly, but this timewith a different purpose.  He worked artfully, loosing slide afterslide of the red soil and sending it streaming down and covering up allhe had uncovered, hiding from the light of day the treasure he haddiscovered.  He even went into the woods and scooped armfuls of lastyear's fallen leaves which he scattered over the slide.  But this hegave up as a vain task; and he sent more slides of soil down upon thescene of his labor, until no sign remained of the out-jutting walls ofthe vein.Next he repaired the broken pipe, gathered his tools together, andstarted up the trail.  He walked slowly, feeling a great weariness, asof a man who had passed through a frightful crisis.He put the tools away, took a great drink of the water that againflowed through the pipes, and sat down on the bench by the open kitchendoor.  Dede was inside, preparing supper, and the sound of herfootsteps gave him a vast content.He breathed the balmy mountain air in great gulps, like a diverfresh-risen from the sea.  And, as he drank in the air, he gazed withall his eyes at the clouds and sky and valley, as if he were drinkingin that, too, along with the air.Dede did not know he had come back, and at times he turned his head andstole glances in at her--at her efficient hands, at the bronze of herbrown hair that smouldered with fire when she crossed the path ofsunshine that streamed through the window, at the promise of her figurethat shot through him a pang most strangely sweet and sweetly dear.  Heheard her approaching the door, and kept his head turned resolutelytoward the valley.  And next, he thrilled, as he had always thrilled,when he felt the caressing gentleness of her fingers through his hair."I didn't know you were back," she said.  "Was it serious?""Pretty bad, that slide," he answered, still gazing away and thrillingto her touch.  "More serious than I reckoned.  But I've got the plan.Do you know what I'm going to do?--I'm going to plant eucalyptus allover it.  They'll hold it.  I'll plant them thick as grass, so thateven a hungry rabbit can't squeeze between them; and when they gettheir roots agoing, nothing in creation will ever move that dirt again.""Why, is it as bad as that?"He shook his head."Nothing exciting.  But I'd sure like to see any blamed old slide getthe best of me, that's all.  I'm going to seal that slide down so thatit'll stay there for a million years.  And when the last trump sounds,and Sonoma Mountain and all the other mountains pass into nothingness,that old slide will be still a-standing there, held up by the roots."He passed his arm around her and pulled her down on his knees."Say, little woman, you sure miss a lot by living here on theranch--music, and theatres, and such things.  Don't you ever have ahankering to drop it all and go back?"So great was his anxiety that he dared not look at her, and when shelaughed and shook her head he was aware of a great relief. Also, henoted the undiminished youth that rang through that same old-timeboyish laugh of hers."Say," he said, with sudden fierceness, "don't you go fooling aroundthat slide until after I get the trees in and rooted. It's mightydangerous, and I sure can't afford to lose you now."He drew her lips to his and kissed her hungrily and passionately."What a lover!" she said; and pride in him and in her own womanhood wasin her voice."Look at that, Dede."  He removed one encircling arm and swept it in awide gesture over the valley and the mountains beyond. "The Valley ofthe Moon--a good name, a good name.  Do you know, when I look out overit all, and think of you and of all it means, it kind of makes me achein the throat, and I have things in my heart I can't find the words tosay, and I have a feeling that I can almost understand Browning andthose other high-flying poet-fellows.  Look at Hood Mountain there,just where the sun's striking.  It was down in that crease that wefound the spring.""And that was the night you didn't milk the cows till ten o'clock," shelaughed.  "And if you keep me here much longer, supper won't be anyearlier than it was that night."Both arose from the bench, and Daylight caught up the milk-pail fromthe nail by the door.  He paused a moment longer to look out over thevalley."It's sure grand," he said."It's sure grand," she echoed, laughing joyously at him and with himand herself and all the world, as she passed in through the door.And Daylight, like the old man he once had met, himself went down thehill through the fires of sunset with a milk pail on his arm.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Burning Daylight, by Jack London*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SPOILERS ***Produced by Charles Franks and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.THE SPOILERSBy REX BEACHAuthor of "THE AUCTION BLOCK" "RAINBOW'S END" "THE IRON TRAIL" Etc.Illustrated       THIS BOOKIS LOVINGLY DEDICATED TO       MY MOTHERCONTENTSCHAPTER    I.

THE PROMISE OF DREAMSCHAPTER ITHE ENCOUNTERGlenister gazed out over the harbor, agleam with the lights of anchoredships, then up at the crenelated mountains, black against the sky. Hedrank the cool air burdened with its taints of the sea, while the bloodof his boyhood leaped within him."Oh, it's fine--fine," he murmured, "and this is my country--mycountry, after all, Dex. It's in my veins, this hunger for the North. Igrow. I expand.""Careful you don't bust," warned Dextry. "I've seen men get plumb drunkon mountain air. Don't expand too strong in one spot." He went backabruptly to his pipe, its villanous fumes promptly averting any dangerof the air's too tonic quality."Gad! What a smudge!" sniffed the younger man. "You ought to be inquarantine.""I'd ruther smell like a man than talk like a kid. You desecrate thehour of meditation with rhapsodies on nature when your aesthetics ain'thoned up to the beauties of good tobacco."The other laughed, inflating his deep chest. In the gloom he stretchedhis muscles restlessly, as though an excess of vigor filled him.They were lounging upon the dock, while before them lay the Santa Mariaready for her midnight sailing. Behind slept Unalaska, quaint, antique,and Russian, rusting amid the fogs of Bering Sea. Where, a week before,mild-eyed natives had dried their cod among the old bronze cannon, nowa frenzied horde of gold-seekers paused in their rush to the new ElDorado. They had come like a locust cloud, thousands strong, settlingon the edge of the Smoky Sea, waiting the going of the ice that barredthem from their Golden Fleece--from Nome the new, where men foundfortune in a night.The mossy hills back of the village were ridged with graves of thosewho had died on the out-trip the fall before, when a plague had grippedthe land--but what of that? Gold glittered in the sands, so said thesurvivors; therefore men came in armies. Glenister and Dextry had leftNome the autumn previous, the young man raving with fever. Now theyreturned to their own land."This air whets every animal instinct in me," Glenister broke outagain. "Away from the cities I turn savage. I feel the old primitivepassions--the fret for fighting.""Mebbe you'll have a chance.""How so?""Well, it's this way. I met Mexico Mullins this mornin'. You mind oldMexico, don't you? The feller that relocated Discovery Claim on AnvilCreek last summer?""You don't mean that 'tin-horn' the boys were going to lynch forclaim-jumping?""Identical! Remember me tellin' you about a good turn I done him oncedown Guadalupe way?""Greaser shooting-scrape, wasn't it?""Yep! Well, I noticed first off that he's gettin fat; high-livin' fat,too, all in one spot, like he was playin' both ends ag'in the centre.Also he wore di'mon's fit to handle with ice-tongs."Says I, lookin' at his side elevation, 'What's accented your middlesyllable so strong, Mexico?'"'Prosperity, politics, an' the Waldorf-Astorier,' says he. It seemsMex hadn't forgot old days. He claws me into a corner an' says, 'Bill,I'm goin' to pay you back for that Moralez deal.'"'It ain't comin' to me,' says I. 'That's a bygone!'"'Listen here,' says he, an', seein' he was in earnest, I let him runon."'How much do you value that claim o' yourn at?'"'Hard tellin',' says I. 'If she holds out like she run last fall,there'd ought to be a million clear in her.""'How much'll you clean up this summer?'"''Bout four hundred thousand, with luck.'"'Bill,' says he, 'there's hell a-poppin' an' you've got to watch thatground like you'd watch a rattle-snake. Don't never leave 'em get agrip on it or you're down an' out.'"He was so plumb in earnest it scared me up, 'cause Mexico ain't agabby man."'What do you mean?' says I."'I can't tell you nothin' more. I'm puttin' a string on my own neck,sayin' THIS much. You're a square man, Bill, an' I'm a gambler, but yousaved my life oncet, an' I wouldn't steer you wrong. For God's sake,don't let 'em jump your ground, that's all.'"'Let who jump it? Congress has give us judges an' courts an'marshals--' I begins."'That's just it. How you goin' to buck that hand? Them's the bestcards in the deck. There's a man comin' by the name of McNamara. Watchhim clost. I can't tell you no more. But don't never let 'em get a gripon your ground.' That's all he'd say.""Bah! He's crazy! I wish somebody would try to jump the Midas; we'denjoy the exercise."The siren of the Santa Maria interrupted, its hoarse warning throbbingup the mountain."We'll have to get aboard," said Dextry."Sh-h! What's that?" the other whispered.At first the only sound they heard was a stir from the deck of thesteamer. Then from the water below them came the rattle of rowlocks anda voice cautiously muffled."Stop! Stop there!"A skiff burst from the darkness, grounding on the beach beneath. Afigure scrambled out and up the ladder leading to the wharf.Immediately a second boat, plainly in pursuit of the first one, struckon the beach behind it.As the escaping figure mounted to their level the watchers perceivedwith amazement that it was a young woman. Breath sobbed from her lungs,and, stumbling, she would have fallen but for Glenister, who ranforward and helped her to her feet."Don't let them get me," she panted.He turned to his partner in puzzled inquiry, but found that the old manhad crossed to the head of the landing ladder up which the pursuerswere climbing."Just a minute--you there! Back up or I'll kick your face in." Dextry'svoice was sharp and unexpected, and in the darkness he loomed tall andmenacing to those below."Get out of the way. That woman's a runaway," came from the one higheston the ladder."So I jedge.""She broke qu--""Shut up!" broke in another. "Do you want to advertise it? Get out ofthe way, there, ye damn fool! Climb up, Thorsen." He spoke like a buckomate, and his words stirred the bile of Dextry.Thorsen grasped the dock floor, trying to climb up, but the old minerstamped on his fingers and the sailor loosened his hold with a yell,carrying the under men with him to the beach in his fall."This way! Follow me!" shouted the mate, making up the bank for theshore end of the wharf."You'd better pull your freight, miss," Dextry remarked; "they'll behere in a minute.""Yes, yes! Let us go! I must get aboard the Santa Maria. She's leavingnow. Come, come!"Glenister laughed, as though there were a humorous touch in her remark,but did not stir."I'm gettin' awful old an' stiff to run," said Dextry, removing hismackinaw, "but I allow I ain't too old for a little diversion in theway of a rough-house when it comes nosin' around." He moved lightly,though the girl could see in the half-darkness that his hair wassilvery."What do you mean?" she questioned, sharply."You hurry along, miss; we'll toy with 'em till you're aboard." Theystepped across to the dockhouse, backing against it. The girl followed.Again came the warning blast from the steamer, and the voice of anofficer:"Clear away that stern line!""Oh, we'll be left!" she breathed, and somehow it struck Glenister thatshe feared this more than the men whose approaching feet he heard."YOU can make it all right," he urged her, roughly. "You'll get hurt ifyou stay here. Run along and don't mind us. We've been thirty days onshipboard, and were praying for something to happen." His voice wasboyishly glad, as if he exulted in the fray that was to come; and nosooner had he spoken than the sailors came out of the darkness uponthem.During the space of a few heart-beats there was only a tangle ofwhirling forms with the sound of fist on flesh, then the blot split upand forms plunged outward, falling heavily. Again the sailors rushed,attempting to clinch. They massed upon Dextry only to grasp empty air,for he shifted with remarkable agility, striking bitterly, as an oldwolf snaps. It was baffling work, however, for in the darkness hisblows fell short or overreached.Glenister, on the other hand, stood carelessly, beating the men off asthey came to him. He laughed gloatingly, deep in his throat, as thoughthe encounter were merely some rough sport. The girl shuddered, for thedesperate silence of the attacking men terrified her more than a din,and yet she stayed, crouched against the wall.Dextry swung at a dim target, and, missing it, was whirled off hisbalance. Instantly his antagonist grappled with him, and they fell tothe floor, while a third man shuffled about them. The girl throttled ascream."I'm goin' to kick 'im, Bill," the man panted hoarsely. "Le' me fix'im." He swung his heavy shoe, and Bill cursed with stirring eloquence."Ow! You're kickin' me! I've got 'im, safe enough. Tackle the big un."Bill's ally then started towards the others, his body bent, his armsflexed yet hanging loosely. He crouched beside the girl, ignoring her,while she heard the breath wheezing from his lungs; then silently heleaped. Glenister had hurled a man from him, then stepped back to avoidthe others, when he was seized from behind and felt the man's armswrapped about his neck, the sailor's legs locked about his thighs. Nowcame the girl's first knowledge of real fighting. The two spun back andforth so closely entwined as to be indistinguishable, the othersholding off. For what seemed many minutes they struggled, the young manstriving to reach his adversary, till they crashed against the wallnear her and she heard her champion's breath coughing in his throat atthe tightening grip of the sailor. Fright held her paralyzed, for shehad never seen men thus. A moment and Glenister would be down beneaththeir stamping feet--they would kick his life out with their heavyshoes. At thought of it, the necessity of action smote her like a blowin the face. Her terror fell away, her shaking muscles stiffened, andbefore realizing what she did she had acted.The seaman's back was to her. She reached out and gripped him by thehair, while her fingers, tense as talons, sought his eyes. Then thefirst loud sound of the battle arose. The man yelled in sudden terror;and the others as suddenly fell back. The next instant she felt a handupon her shoulder and heard Dextry's voice."Are ye hurt? No? Come on, then, or we'll get left." He spoke quietly,though his breath was loud, and, glancing down, she saw the huddledform of the sailor whom he had fought."That's all right--he ain't hurt. It's a Jap trick I learned. Hurry up!"They ran swiftly down the wharf, followed by Glenister and by thegroans of the sailors in whom the lust for combat had been quenched. Asthey scrambled up the Santa Maria's gang-plank, a strip of waterwidened between the boat and the pier."Close shave, that," panted Glenister, feeling his throat gingerly,"but I wouldn't have missed it for a spotted pup.""I've been through b'iler explosions and snowslides, not to mention atriflin' jail-delivery, but fer real sprightly diversions I don'trecall nothin' more pleasin' than this." Dextry's enthusiasm wasboylike."What kind of men are you?" the girl laughed nervously, but got noanswer.They led her to their deck cabin, where they switched on the electriclight, blinking at each other and at their unknown guest.They saw a graceful and altogether attractive figure in a trim, shortskirt and long, tan boots. But what Glenister first saw was her eyes;large and gray, almost brown under the electric light. They were activeeyes, he thought, and they flashed swift, comprehensive glances at thetwo men. Her hair had fallen loose and crinkled to her waist, allagleam. Otherwise she showed no sign of her recent ordeal.Glenister had been prepared for the type of beauty that follows thefrontier; beauty that may stun, but that has the polish and chill of anew-ground bowie. Instead, this girl with the calm, reposeful facestruck a note almost painfully different from her surroundings,suggesting countless pleasant things that had been strange to him forthe past few years.Pure admiration alone was patent in the older man's gaze."I make oration," said he, "that you're the gamest little chap I everfought over, Mexikin, Injun, or white. What's the trouble?""I suppose you think I've done something dreadful, don't you?" shesaid. "But I haven't. I had to get away from the Ohio to-nightfor--certain reasons. I'll tell you all about it to-morrow. I haven'tstolen anything, nor poisoned the crew--really I haven't." She smiledat them, and Glenister found it impossible not to smile with her,though dismayed by her feeble explanation."Well, I'll wake up the steward and find a place for you to go," hesaid at length. "You'll have to double up with some of the women,though; it's awfully crowded aboard."She laid a detaining hand on his arm. He thought he felt her tremble."No, no! I don't want you to do that. They mustn't see me to-night. Iknow I'm acting strangely and all that, but it's happened so quickly Ihaven't found myself yet. I'll tell you to-morrow, though, really.Don't let any one see me or it will spoil everything. Wait tillto-morrow, please."She was very white, and spoke with eager intensity."Help you? Why, sure Mike!" assured the impulsive Dextry, "an', seehere, Miss--you take your time on explanations. We don't care a cusswhat you done. Morals ain't our long suit, 'cause 'there's never a lawof God or man runs north of Fifty-three,' as the poetry man remarked,an' he couldn't have spoke truer if he'd knowed what he was sayin'.Everybody is privileged to 'look out' his own game up here. A squaredeal an' no questions asked."She looked somewhat doubtful at this till she caught the heat ofGlenister's gaze. Some boldness of his look brought home to her theactual situation, and a stain rose in her cheek. She noted him morecarefully; noted his heavy shoulders and ease of bearing, an ease andlooseness begotten of perfect muscular control. Strength was equallysuggested in his face, she thought, for he carried a marked youngcountenance, with thrusting chin, aggressive thatching brows, andmobile mouth that whispered all the changes from strength to abandon.Prominent was a look of reckless energy. She considered him handsome ina heavy, virile, perhaps too purely physical fashion."You want to stowaway?" he asked."I've had a right smart experience in that line," said Dextry, "but Inever done it by proxy. What's your plan?""She will stay here to-night," said Glenister quickly. "You and I willgo below. Nobody will see her.""I can't let you do that," she objected. "Isn't there some place whereI can hide?" But they reassured her and left.When they had gone, she crouched trembling upon her seat for a longtime, gazing fixedly before her. "I'm afraid!" she whispered; "I'mafraid. What am I getting into? Why do men look so at me? I'mfrightened. Oh, I'm sorry I undertook it." At last she rose wearily.The close cabin oppressed her; she felt the need of fresh air. So,turning out the lights, she stepped forth into the night. Figuresloomed near the rail and she slipped astern, screening herself behind alife-boat, where the cool breeze fanned her face.The forms she had seen approached, speaking earnestly. Instead ofpassing, they stopped abreast of her hiding-place; then, as they beganto talk, she saw that her retreat was cut off and that she must notstir."What brings her here?" Glenister was echoing a question of Dextry's."Bah! What brings them all? What brought 'the Duchess,' and CherryMalotte, and all the rest?""No, no," said the old man. "She ain't that kind--she's too fine, toodelicate--too pretty.""That's just it--too pretty! Too pretty to be alone--or anything exceptwhat she is."Dextry growled sourly. "This country has plumb ruined you, boy. Youthink they're all alike--an' I don't know but they are--all but thisgirl. Seems like she's different, somehow--but I can't tell."Glenister spoke musingly:"I had an ancestor who buccaneered among the Indies, a long timeago--so I'm told. Sometimes I think I have his disposition. He comesand whispers things to me in the night. Oh, he was a devil, and I'vegot his blood in me--untamed and hot--I can hear him saying somethingnow--something about the spoils of war. Ha, ha! Maybe he's right. Ifought for her to-night--Dex--the way he used to fight for hissweethearts along the Mexicos. She's too beautiful to be good--and'there's never a law of God or man runs north of Fifty-three.'"They moved on, his vibrant, cynical laughter stabbing the girl till sheleaned against the yawl for support.She held herself together while the blood beat thickly in her ears,then fled to the cabin, hurling herself into her berth, where shewrithed silently, beating the pillow with hands into which her nailshad bitten, staring the while into the darkness with dry and achingeyes.CHAPTER IITHE STOWAWAYShe awoke to the throb of the engines, and, gazing cautiously throughher stateroom window, saw a glassy, level sea, with the sun brightlyagleam on it.So this was Bering? She had clothed it always with the mystery of herschool-days, thinking of it as a weeping, fog-bound stretch of graywaters. Instead, she saw a flat, sunlit main, with occasionalsea-parrots flapping their fat bodies out of the ship's course. Aglistening head popped up from the waters abreast, and she heard thecry of "seal!"Dressing, the girl noted minutely the personal articles scattered aboutthe cabin, striving to derive therefrom some fresh hint of thecharacteristics of the owners. First, there was an elaborate,copper-backed toilet-set, all richly ornamented and leather-bound. Themetal was magnificently hand-worked and bore Glenister's initial. Itspoke of elegant extravagance, and seemed oddly out of place in anArctic miner's equipment, as did also a small set of De Maupassant.Next, she picked up Kipling's Seven Seas, marked liberally, and feltthat she had struck a scent. The roughness and brutality of the poemshad always chilled her, though she had felt vaguely their splendidpulse and swing. This was the girl's first venture from a shelteredlife. She had not rubbed elbows with the world enough to find thatTruth may be rough, unshaven, and garbed in homespun. The bookconfirmed her analysis of the junior partner.Pendent from a hook was a worn and blackened holster from which peepedthe butt of a large Colt's revolver, showing evidence of many years'service. It spoke mutely of the white-haired Dextry, who, before herinspection was over, knocked at the door, and, when she admitted him,addressed her cautiously:"The boy's down forrad, teasin' grub out of a flunky. He'll be up in aminute. How'd ye sleep?""Very well, thank you," she lied, "but I've been thinking that I oughtto explain myself to you.""Now, see here," the old man interjected, "there ain't no explanationsneeded till you feel like givin' them up. You was in trouble--that'sunfortunate; we help you--that's natural; no questions asked--that'sAlaska.""Yes--but I know you must think--""What bothers me," the other continued irrelevantly, "is how in blazeswe're goin' to keep you hid. The steward's got to make up this room,and somebody's bound to see us packin' grub in.""I don't care who knows if they won't send me back. They wouldn't dothat, would they?" She hung anxiously on his words."Send you back? Why, don't you savvy that this boat is bound for Nome?There ain't no turnin' back on gold stampedes, and this is the wildestrush the world ever saw. The captain wouldn't turn back--hecouldn't--his cargo's too precious and the company pays five thousand aday for this ship. No, we ain't puttin' back to unload no stowaways atfive thousand per. Besides, we passengers wouldn't let him--time's tooprecious." They were interrupted by the rattle of dishes outside, andDextry was about to open the door when his hand wavered uncertainlyabove the knob, for he heard the hearty greeting of the ship's captain."Well, well, Glenister, where's all the breakfast going?""Oo!" whispered the old man--"that's Cap' Stephens.""Dextry isn't feeling quite up to form this morning," replied Glenistereasily."Don't wonder! Why weren't you aboard sooner last night? I sawyou--'most got left, eh? Served you right if you had." Then his voicedropped to the confidential: "I'd advise you to cut out those women.Don't misunderstand me, boy, but they're a bad lot on this boat. I sawyou come aboard. Take my word for it--they're a bad lot. Cut 'em out.Guess I'll step inside and see what's up with Dextry."The girl shrank into her corner, gazing apprehensively at the otherlistener."Well--er--he isn't up yet," they heard Glenister stammer; "better comearound later.""Nonsense; it's time he was dressed." The master's voice was grufflygood-natured. "Hello, Dextry! Hey! Open up for inspection." He rattledthe door.There was nothing to be done. The old miner darted an inquiring glanceat his companion, then, at her nod, slipped the bolt, and the captain'sblue bulk filled the room.His grizzled, close-bearded face was genially wrinkled till he spiedthe erect, gray figure in the corner, when his cap came offinvoluntarily. There his courtesy ended, however, and the smile diedcoldly from his face. His eyes narrowed, and the good-fellowship fellaway, leaving him the stiff and formal officer."Ah," he said, "not feeling well, eh? I thought I had met all of ourlady passengers. Introduce me, Dextry."Dextry squirmed under his cynicism."Well--I--ah--didn't catch the name myself.""What?""Oh, there ain't much to say. This is the lady--we brought aboard lastnight--that's all.""Who gave you permission?""Nobody. There wasn't time.""There wasn't TIME, eh? Which one of you conceived the novel scheme ofstowing away ladies in your cabin? Whose is she? Quick! Answer me."Indignation was vibrant in his voice."Oh!" the girl cried--her eyes widening darkly. She stood slim and paleand slightly trembling.His words had cut her bitterly, though through it all he hadscrupulously avoided addressing her.The captain turned to Glenister, who had entered and closed the door."Is this your work? Is she yours?""No," he answered quietly, while Dextry chimed in:"Better hear details, captain, before you make breaks like that. Wehelped the lady side-step some sailors last night and we most got leftdoing it. It was up to her to make a quick get-away, so we helped heraboard.""A poor story! What was she running away from?" He still addressed themen, ignoring her completely, till, with hoarse voice, she broke in:"You mustn't talk about me that way--I can answer your questions. It'strue--I ran away. I had to. The sailors came after me and fought withthese men. I had to get away quickly, and your friends helped me onhere from gentlemanly kindness, because they saw me unprotected. Theyare still protecting me. I can't explain how important it is for me toreach Nome on the first boat, because it isn't my secret. It wasimportant enough to make me leave my uncle at Seattle at an hour'snotice when we found there was no one else who could go. That's all Ican say. I took my maid with me, but the sailors caught her just as shewas following me down the ship's ladder. She had my bag of clothes whenthey seized her. I cast off the rope and rowed ashore as fast as Icould, but they lowered another boat and followed me."The captain eyed her sharply, and his grim lines softened a bit, forshe was clean-cut and womanly, and utterly out of place, He took herin, shrewdly, detail by detail, then spoke directly to her:"My dear young lady--the other ships will get there just as quickly asours, maybe more quickly. To-morrow we strike the ice-pack and then itis all a matter of luck.""Yes, but the ship I left won't get there."At this the commander started, and, darting a great, thick-fingeredhand at her, spoke savagely:"What's that? What ship? Which one did you come from? Answer me.""The Ohio," she replied, with the effect of a hand-grenade. The masterglared at her."The Ohio! Good God! You DARE to stand there and tell me that?" Heturned and poured his rage upon the others."She says the Ohio, d'ye hear? You've ruined me! I'll put you inirons--all of you. The Ohio!""What d'ye mean? What's up?""What's up? There's small-pox aboard the Ohio! This girl has brokenquarantine. The health inspectors bottled up the boat at six o'clocklast night! That's why I pulled out of Unalaska ahead of time, to avoidany possible delay. Now we'll all be held up when we get to Nome. GreatHeavens! do you realize what this means--bringing this hussy aboard?"His eyes burned and his voice shook, while the two partners stared ateach other in dismay. Too well they knew the result of a small-poxpanic aboard this crowded troop-ship. Not only was every availablecabin bulging with passengers, but the lower decks were jammed withboth humanity and live stock all in the most unsanitary conditions. Thecraft, built for three hundred passengers, was carrying triple hercapacity; men and women were stowed away like cattle. Order and ahalf-tolerable condition were maintained only by the efforts of thepassengers themselves, who held to the thought that imprisonment andinconvenience would last but a few days longer. They had been aboardthree weeks and every heart was aflame with the desire to reachNome--to reach it ahead of the pressing horde behind.What would be the temper of this gold-frenzied army if thrown intoquarantine within sight of their goal? The impatient hundreds wouldhave to lie packed in their floating prison, submitting to the fouldisease. Long they must lie thus, till a month should have passed afterthe disappearance of the last symptom. If the disease recurredsporadically, that might mean endless weeks of maddening idleness. Itmight even be impossible to impose the necessary restraint; there wouldbe violence, perhaps mutiny.The fear of the sickness was nothing to Dextry and Glenister, but oftheir mine they thought with terror. What would happen in theirabsence, where conditions were as unsettled as in this new land; wheretitles were held only by physical possession of the premises? Duringthe long winter of their absence, ice had held their treasureinviolate, but with the warming summer the jewel they had fought for sowearily would lie naked and exposed to the first comer. The Midas layin the valley of the richest creek, where men had schemed and foughtand slain for the right to inches. It was the fruit of cheerless,barren years of toil, and if they could not guard it--they knew theresult.The girl interrupted their distressing reflections."Don't blame these men, sir," she begged the captain. "I am the onlyone at fault. Oh! I HAD to get away. I have papers here that must bedelivered quickly." She laid a hand upon her bosom. "They couldn't betrusted to the unsettled mail service. It's almost life and death. AndI assure you there is no need of putting me in quarantine. I haven'tthe smallpox. I wasn't even exposed to it.""There's nothing else to do," said Stephens. "I'll isolate you in thedeck smoking-cabin. God knows what these madmen on board will do whenthey hear about it, though. They're apt to tear you to shreds. They'recrazy!"Glenister had been thinking rapidly."If you do that, you'll have mutiny in an hour. This isn't the crowd tostand that sort of thing.""Bah! Let 'em try it. I'll put 'em down." The officer's square jawsclicked."Maybe so; but what then? We reach Nome and the Health Inspector hearsof small-pox suspects, then we're all quarantined for thirty days;eight hundred of us. We'll lie at Egg Island all summer while yourcompany pays five thousand a day for this ship. That's not all. Thefirm is liable in damages for your carelessness in letting diseaseaboard.""MY CARELESSNESS!" The old man ground his teeth."Yes; that's what it amounts to. You'll ruin your owners, all right.You'll tie up your ship and lose your job, that's a cinch!"Captain Stephens wiped the moisture from his brow angrily."My carelessness! Curse you--you say it well. Don't you realize that Iam criminally liable if I don't take every precaution?" He paused for amoment, considering. "I'll hand her over to the ship's doctor.""See here, now," Glenister urged. "We'll be in Nome in a week--beforethe young lady would have time to show symptoms of the disease, even ifshe were going to have it--and a thousand to one she hasn't beenexposed, and will never show a trace of it. Nobody knows she's aboardbut we three. Nobody will see her get off. She'll stay in this cabin,which will be just as effectual as though you isolated her in any otherpart of the boat. It will avoid a panic--you'll save your ship and yourcompany--no one will be the wiser--then if the girl comes down withsmall-pox after she gets ashore, she can go to the pest-house and notjeopardize the health of all the people aboard this ship. You go upforrad to your bridge, sir, and forget that you stepped in to see oldBill Dextry this morning. Well take care of this matter all right. Itmeans as much to us as it does to you. We've GOT to be on Anvil Creekbefore the ground thaws or we'll lose the Midas. If you make a fuss,you'll ruin us all."For some moments they watched him breathlessly as he frowned inindecision, then--"You'll have to look out for the steward," he said, and the girl sankto a stool while two great tears rolled down her cheeks. The captain'seyes softened and his voice was gentle as he laid his hand on her head."Don't feel hurt over what I said, miss. You see, appearances don'ttell much, hereabouts--most of the pretty ones are no good. They'vefooled me many a time, and I made a mistake. These men will help youthrough; I can't. Then when you get to Nome, make your sweetheart marryyou the day you land. You are too far north to be alone."He stepped out into the passage and closed the door carefully.CHAPTER IIIIN WHICH GLENISTER ERRS"Well, bein' as me an' Glenister is gougin' into the bowels of AnvilCreek all last summer, we don't really get the fresh-grub habitfastened on us none. You see, the gamblers down-town cop out the fewaigs an' green vegetables that stray off the ships, so they never getout as far as the Creek none; except, maybe, in the shape of anecdotes."We don't get intimate with no nutriments except hog-boosum an' brownbeans, of which luxuries we have unstinted measure, an' bein' as thisis our third year in the country we hanker for bony fido grub,somethin' scan'lous. Yes, ma'am--three years without a taste of freshfruit nor meat nor nuthin'--except pork an' beans. Why, I've et bacontill my immortal soul has growed a rind."When it comes time to close down the claim, the boy is sick with thefever an' the only ship in port is a Point Barrow whaler, bound forSeattle. After I book our passage, I find they have nothin' aboard toeat except canned salmon, it bein' the end of a two years' cruise, sowhen I land in the States after seventeen days of a fish diet, I amwhat you might call sated with canned grub, and have added salmon tothe list of things concernin' which I am goin' to economize."Soon's ever I get the boy into a hospital, I gallop up to the bestrestarawnt in town an' prepare for the huge pot-latch. This here, Idetermine, is to be a gormandizin' jag which shall live in hist'ry, an'wharof in later years the natives of Puget Sound shall speak with batedbreath."First, I call for five dollars' worth of pork an' beans an' then afull-grown platter of canned salmon. When the waiter lays 'em out infront of me, I look them vittles coldly in their disgustin' visages,an' say in sarcastic accents:"'Set there, damn you! an' watch me eat REAL grub,' which I proceed todo, cleanin' the menu from soda to hock. When I have done my worst, Ipile bones an' olive seeds an' peelin's all over them articles ofnourishment, stick toothpicks into 'em, an' havin' offered 'em whatother indignities occur to me, I leave the place."Dextry and the girl were leaning over the stern-rail, chatting idly inthe darkness. It was the second night out and the ship lay dead in theice-pack. All about them was a flat, floe-clogged sea, leprous andmottled in the deep twilight that midnight brought in this latitude.They had threaded into the ice-field as long as the light lasted,following the lanes of blue water till they closed, then drifting idlytill others appeared; worming out into leagues of open sea, againcreeping into the shifting labyrinth till darkness rendered progressperilous.Occasionally they had passed herds of walrus huddled sociably uponice-pans, their wet hides glistening in the sunlight. The air had beenclear and pleasant, while away on all quarters they had seen the smokeof other ships toiling through the barrier. The spring fleet wasknocking at the door of the Golden North.Chafing at her imprisonment, the girl had asked the old man to take herout on deck under the shelter of darkness; then she had led him tospeak of his own past experiences, and of Glenister's; which he haddone freely. She was frankly curious about them, and she wondered attheir apparent lack of interest in her own identity and her secretmission. She even construed their silence as indifference, notrealizing that these Northmen were offering her the truest evidence ofcamaraderie.The frontier is capable of no finer compliment than this utterdisregard of one's folded pages. It betokens that highest faith inone's fellow-man, the belief that he should be measured by his presentdeeds, not by his past. It says, translated: "This is God's freecountry where a man is a man, nothing more. Our land is new and pure,our faces are to the front. If you have been square, so much thebetter; if not, leave behind the taints of artificial things and startagain on the level--that's all."It had happened, therefore, that since the men had asked her noquestions, she had allowed the hours to pass and still hesitated toexplain further than she had explained to Captain Stephens. It was mucheasier to let things continue as they were; and there was, after all,so little that she was at liberty to tell them.In the short time since meeting them, the girl had grown to likeDextry, with his blunt chivalry and boyish, whimsical philosophy, butshe avoided Glenister, feeling a shrinking, hidden terror of him, eversince her eavesdropping of the previous night. At the memory of thatscene she grew hot, then cold--hot with anger, icy at the sinisterpower and sureness which had vibrated in his voice. What kind of lifewas she entering where men spoke of strange women with this assuranceand hinted thus of ownership? That he was handsome and unconscious ofit, she acknowledged, and had she met him in her accustomed circle offriends, garbed in the conventionalities, she would perhaps havethought of him as a striking man, vigorous and intelligent; but here heseemed naturally to take on the attributes of his surroundings,acquiring a picturesque negligee of dress and morals, and suggestingrugged, elemental, chilling potentialities. While with him--and he hadsought her repeatedly that day--she was uneasily aware of his strongpersonality tugging at her; aware of the unbridled passionate flood ofa nature unbrooking of delay and heedless of denial. This it was thatantagonized her and set her every mental sinew in rigid resistance.During Dextry's garrulous ramblings, Glenister emerged from thedarkness and silently took his place beside her, against the rail."What portent do you see that makes you stare into the night soanxiously?" he inquired."I am wishing for a sight of the midnight sun or the aurora borealis,"she replied."Too late for one an' too fur south for the other," Dextry interposed."We'll see the sun further north, though.""Have you ever heard the real origin of the Northern Lights?" the youngman inquired."Naturally, I never have," she answered."Well, here it is. I have it from the lips of a great hunter of theTananas. He told it to me when I was sick, once, in his cabin, andinasmuch as he is a wise Indian and has a reputation for truth, I haveno doubt that it is scrupulously correct."In the very old days, before the white man or corned beef had invadedthis land, the greatest tribe in all the North was the Tananas. Thebravest hunter of these was Itika, the second chief. He could follow amoose till it fell exhausted in the snow and he had many belts madefrom the claws of the brown bear which is deadly wicked and, as everyone knows, inhabited by the spirits of 'Yabla-men,' or devils."One winter a terrible famine settled over the Tanana Valley. The moosedeparted from the gulches and the caribou melted from the hills likemist. The dogs grew gaunt and howled all night, the babies cried, thewomen became hollow-eyed and peevish."Then it was that Itika decided to go hunting over the saw-tooth rangewhich formed the edge of the world. They tried to dissuade him, sayingit was certain death because a pack of monstrous white wolves, tallerthan the moose and swifter than the eagle, was known to range thesemountains, running madly in chase. Always, on clear, cold nights, couldbe seen the flashing of the moonbeams from their gleaming hungry sides,and although many hunters had crossed the passes in other years, theynever returned, for the pack slew them."Nothing could deter Itika, however, so he threaded his way up throughthe range and, night coming, burrowed into a drift to sleep in hiscaribou-skin. Peering out into the darkness, he saw the flashing lightsa thousand times brighter than ever before. The whole heavens wereablaze with shifting streamers that raced and writhed back and forth inwild revel. Listening, he heard the hiss and whine of dry snow underthe feet of the pack, and a distant noise as of rushing winds, althoughthe air was deathly still."With daylight, he proceeded through the range, till he came out abovea magnificent valley. Descending the slope, he entered a forest oftowering spruce, while on all sides the snow was trampled with tracksas wide as a snow-shoe. There came to him a noise which, as heproceeded, increased till it filled the woods. It was a frightful din,as though a thousand wolves were howling with the madness of the kill.Cautiously creeping nearer, he found a monstrous white animalstruggling beneath a spruce which had fallen upon it in such fashion asto pinion it securely."All brave men are tender-hearted, so Itika set to work with his axeand cleared away the burden, regardless of the peril to himself. Whenhe had released it, the beast arose and instead of running awayaddressed him in the most polite and polished Indian, without a traceof accent."'You have saved my life. Now, what can I do for you?'"'I want to hunt in this valley. My people are starving,' said Itika,at which the wolf was greatly pleased and rounded up the rest of thepack to help in the kill."Always thereafter when Itika came to the valley of the Yukon the giantdrove hunted with him. To this day they run through the mountains oncold, clear nights, in a multitude, while the light of the moonflickers from their white sides, flashing up into the sky in weird,fantastic figures. Some people call it Northern Lights, but old Isaacassured me earnestly, toothlessly, and with the light of ancient truth,as I lay snow-blind in his lodge, that it is nothing more remarkablethan the spirit of Itika and the great white wolves.""What a queer legend!" she said. "There must be many of them in thiscountry. I feel that I am going to like the North.""Perhaps you will," Glenister replied, "although it is not a woman'sland.""Tell me what led you out here in the first place. You are an Easternman. You have had advantages, education--and yet you choose this. Youmust love the North.""Indeed I do! It calls to a fellow in some strange way that a gentlercountry never could. When once you've lived the long, lazy June daysthat never end, and heard geese honking under a warm, sunlit midnight;or when once you've hit the trail on a winter morning so sharp andclear that the air stings your lungs, and the whole white, silent worldglistens like a jewel; yes--and when you've seen the dogs romping inharness till the sled runners ring; and the distant mountain-rangescome out like beautiful carvings, so close you can reach them--well,there's something in it that brings you back--that's all, no matterwhere you've lost yourself. It means health and equality andunrestraint. That's what I like best, I dare say--the utter unrestraint."When I was a school-boy, I used to gaze at the map of Alaska forhours. I'd lose myself in it. It wasn't anything but a big, blankcorner in the North then, with a name, and mountains, and mystery. Theword 'Yukon' suggested to me everything unknown and weird--hairymastodons, golden river bars, savage Indians with bone arrow-heads andseal-skin trousers. When I left college I came as fast as ever Icould--the adventure, I suppose...."The law was considered my destiny. How the shades of old Choate andWebster and Patrick Henry must have wailed when I forswore it. I'll betBlackstone tore his whiskers.""I think you would have made a success," said the girl, but he laughed."Well, anyhow, I stepped out, leaving the way to the United StatesSupreme bench unobstructed, and came North. I found it was where Ibelonged. I fitted in. I'm not contented--don't think that. I'mambitious, but I prefer these surroundings to the others--that's all.I'm realizing my desires. I've made a fortune--now I'll see what elsethe world has."He suddenly turned to her. "See here," he abruptly questioned, "what'syour name?"She started, and glanced towards where Dextry had stood, only to findthat the old frontiersman had slipped away during the tale."Helen Chester," she replied."Helen Chester," he repeated, musingly. "What a pretty name! It seemsalmost a pity to change it--to marry, as you will.""I am not going to Nome to get married."He glanced at her quickly."Then you won't like this country. You are two years too early; youought to wait till there are railroads and telephones, and tablesd'hote, and chaperons. It's a man's country yet.""I don't see why it isn't a woman's country, too. Surely we can take apart in taming it. Yonder on the Oregon is a complete railroad, whichwill be running from the coast to the mines in a few weeks. Anothership back there has the wire and poles and fixings for a telephonesystem, which will go up in a night. As to tables d'hote, I saw a realFrench count in Seattle with a monocle. He's bringing in a restaurantoutfit, imported snails, and pate de joies gras. All that's wanting isthe chaperon. In my flight from the Ohio I left mine. The sailorscaught her. You see I am not far ahead of schedule.""What part are you going to take in this taming process?" he asked.She paused long before replying, and when she did her answer soundedlike a jest."I herald the coming of the law," she said."The law! Bah! Red tape, a dead language, and a horde of shysters! I'mafraid of law in this land; we're too new and too far away from things.It puts too much power in too few hands. Heretofore we men up here havehad recourse to our courage and our Colts, but we'll have to unbucklethem both when the law comes. I like the court that hasn't any appeal."He laid hand upon his hip."The Colts may go, but the courage never will," she broke in."Perhaps. But I've heard rumors already of a plot to prostitute thelaw. In Unalaska a man warned Dextry, with terror in his eye, to bewareof it; that beneath the cloak of Justice was a drawn dagger whetted forus fellows who own the rich diggings. I don't think there's any truthin it, but you can't tell.""The law is the foundation--there can't be any progress without it.There is nothing here now but disorder.""There isn't half the disorder you think there is. There weren't anycrimes in this country till the tenderfeet arrived. We didn't know whata thief was. If you came to a cabin you walked in without knocking. Theowner filled up the coffee-pot and sliced into the bacon; then whenhe'd started your meal, he shook hands and asked your name. It was justthe same whether his cache was full or whether he'd packed his fewpounds of food two hundred miles on his back. That was hospitality tomake your Southern article look pretty small. If there was no one athome, you ate what you needed. There was but one unpardonable breach ofetiquette--to fail to leave dry kindlings. I'm afraid of the transitorystage we're coming to--that epoch of chaos between the death of the oldand the birth of the new. Frankly, I like the old way best. I love thelicense of it. I love to wrestle with nature; to snatch, and guard, andfight for what I have. I've been beyond the law for years and I want tostay there, where life is just what it was intended to be--a survivalof the fittest."His large hands, as he gripped the bulwark, were tense and corded,while his rich voice issued softly from his chest with the hint ofpower unlimited behind it. He stood over her, tall, virile, andmagnetic. She saw now why he had so joyously hailed the fight of theprevious night; to one of his kind it was as salt air to the nostrils.Unconsciously she approached him, drawn by the spell of his strength."My pleasures are violent and my hate is mighty bitter in my mouth.What I want, I take. That's been my way in the old life, and I'm tooselfish to give it up."He was gazing out upon the dimly lucent miles of ice; but now he turnedtowards her, and, doing so, touched her warm hand next his on the rail.She was staring up at him unaffectedly, so close that the faint odorfrom her hair reached him. Her expression was simply one of wonder andcuriosity at this type, so different from any she had known. But theman's eyes were hot and blinded with the sight of her, and he felt onlyher beauty heightened in the dim light, the brush of her garments, andthe small, soft hand beneath his. The thrill from the touch of itsurged over him--mastered him."What I want--I take," he repeated, and then suddenly he reached forthand, taking her in his arms, crushed her to him, kissing her softly,fiercely, full upon the lips. For an instant she lay gasping andstunned against his breast, then she tore her fist free and, with allher force, struck him full in the face.It was as though she beat upon a stone. With one movement he forced herarm to her side, smiling into her terrified eyes; then, holding herlike iron, he kissed her again and again upon the mouth, the eyes, thehair--and released her."I am going to love you--Helen," said he."And may God strike me dead if I ever stop HATING you!" she cried, hervoice coming thick and hoarse with passion.Turning, she walked proudly forward towards her cabin, a trim,straight, haughty figure; and he did not know that her knees wereshaking and weak.CHAPTER IVTHE KILLINGFor four days the Santa Maria felt blindly through the white fields,drifting north with the spring tide that sets through Behring Strait,till, on the morning of the fifth, open water showed to the east.Creeping through, she broke out into the last stage of the long race,amid the cheers of her weary passengers; and the dull jar of herengines made welcome music to the girl in the deck state-room.Soon they picked up a mountainous coast which rose steadily intomajestic, barren ranges, still white with the melting snows; and at tenin the evening under a golden sunset, amid screaming whistles, theyanchored in the roadstead of Nome. Before the rumble of her chains hadceased or the echo from the fleet's salute had died from the shorewardhills, the ship was surrounded by a swarm of tiny craft clamoring abouther iron sides, while an officer in cap and gilt climbed the bridge andgreeted Captain Stephens. Tugs with trailing lighters circleddiscreetly about, awaiting the completion of certain formalities. Theseover, the uniformed gentleman dropped back into his skiff and rowedaway."A clean bill of health, captain," he shouted, saluting the commander."Thank ye, sir," roared the sailor, and with that the row-boats swarmedinward pirate-like, boarding the steamer from all quarters.As the master turned, he looked down from his bridge to the deck below,full into the face of Dextry, who had been an intent witness of themeeting. With unbending dignity, Captain Stephens let his left eyeliddroop slowly, while a boyish grin spread widely over his face.Simultaneously, orders rang sharp and fast from the bridge, the crewbroke into feverish life, the creak of booms and the clank ofdonkey-hoists arose."We're here, Miss Stowaway," said Glenister, entering the girl's cabin."The inspector passed us and it's time for you to see the magic city.Come, it's a wonderful sight."This was the first time they had been alone since the scene on theafter-deck, for, besides ignoring Glenister, she had managed that heshould not even see her except in Dextry's presence. Although he hadever since been courteous and considerate, she felt the leapingemotions that were hidden within him and longed to leave the ship, tofly from the spell of his personality. Thoughts of him made her writhe,and yet when he was near she could not hate him as she willed--heoverpowered her, he would not be hated, he paid no heed to her slights.This very quality reminded her how willingly and unquestioningly he hadfought off the sailors from the Ohio at a word from her. She knew hewould do so again, and more, and it is hard to be bitter to one whowould lay down his life for you, even though he hasoffended--particularly when he has the magnetism that sweeps you awayfrom your moorings."There's no danger of being seen," he continued, "The crowd's crazy,and, besides, we'll go ashore right away. You must be mad with theconfinement--it's on my nerves, too."As they stepped outside, the door of an adjacent cabin opened, framingan angular, sharp-featured woman, who, catching sight of the girlemerging from Glenister's state-room, paused with shrewdly narrowedeyes, flashing quick, malicious glances from one to the other. Theycame later to remember with regret this chance encounter, for it wasfraught with grave results for them both."Good evening, Mr. Glenister," the lady said with acid cordiality."Howdy, Mrs. Champian?" He moved away.She followed a step, staring at Helen."Are you going ashore to-night or wait for morning?""Don't know yet, I'm sure." Then aside to the girl he muttered, "Shakeher, she's spying on us.""Who is she?" asked Miss Chester, a moment later."Her husband manages one of the big companies. She's an old cat."Gaining her first view of the land, the girl cried out, sharply. Theyrode on an oily sea, tinted like burnished copper, while on all sides,amid the faint rattle and rumble of machinery, scores of ships werebelching cargoes out upon living swarms of scows, tugs, stern-wheelers,and dories. Here and there Eskimo oomiaks, fat, walrus-hide boats, slidabout like huge, many-legged water-bugs. An endless, ant-like stream oftenders, piled high with freight, plied to and from the shore. A miledistant lay the city, stretched like a white ribbon between the gold ofthe ocean sand and the dun of the moss-covered tundra. It was like noother in the world. At first glance it seemed all made of new whitecanvas. In a week its population had swelled from three to thirtythousand. It now wandered in a slender, sinuous line along the coastfor miles, because only the beach afforded dry camping ground. Mountingto the bank behind, one sank knee-deep in moss and water, and, treadingtwice in the same tracks, found a bog of oozing, icy mud. Therefore, asthe town doubled daily in size, it grew endwise like a string ofdominoes, till the shore from Cape Nome to Penny River was a long reachof white, glinting in the low rays of the arctic sunset like foamybreakers on a tropic island."That's Anvil Creek up yonder," said Glenister. "There's where theMidas lies. See!" He indicated a gap in the buttress of mountainsrolling back from the coast. "It's the greatest creek in the world.You'll see gold by the mule-load, and hillocks of nuggets. Oh, I'm gladto get back. THIS is life. That stretch of beach is full of gold. Thesehills are seamed with quartz. The bed-rock of that creek is yellow.There's gold, gold, gold, everywhere--more than ever was in oldSolomon's mines--and there's mystery and peril and things unknown.""Let us make haste," said the girl. "I have something I must doto-night. After that, I can learn to know these things."Securing a small boat, they were rowed ashores the partners plyingtheir ferryman with eager questions. Having arrived five days before,he was exploding with information and volunteered the fruits of hisripe experience till Dextry stated that they were "sourdoughs"themselves, and owned the Midas, whereupon Miss Chester marvelled atthe awe which sat upon the man and the wondering stare with which hedevoured the partners, to her own utter exclusion."Sufferin' cats! Look at the freight!" ejaculated Dextry. "If a stormcome up it would bust the community!"The beach they neared was walled and crowded to the high-tide mark withramparts of merchandise, while every incoming craft deposited its quotaupon whatever vacant foot was close at hand, till bales, boxes,boilers, and baggage of all kinds were confusedly intermixed in thenarrow space. Singing longshoremen trundled burdens from the lightersand piled them on the heap, while yelling, cursing crowds fought overit all, selecting, sorting, loading.There was no room for more, yet hourly they added to the mass. Teamssplashed through the lapping surf or stuck in the deep sand betweenhillocks of goods. All was noise, profanity, congestion, and feverishhurry. This burning haste rang in the voice of the multitude, showed inits violence of gesture and redness of face, permeated the atmospherewith a magnetic, electrifying energy."It's somethin' fierce ashore," said the oarsman. "I been up fer threedays an' nights steady--there ain't no room, nor time, nor darkness tosleep in. Ham an' eggs is a dollar an' a half, an' whiskey's four bitsa throw." He wailed the last, sadly, as a complaint unspeakable."Any trouble doin'?" inquired the old man."You KNOW it!" the other cried, colloquially. "There was a massacree inthe Northern last night.""Gamblin' row?""Yep. Tin-horn called 'Missou' done it.""Sho!" said Dextry. "I know him. He's a bad actor." All three mennodded sagely, and the girl wished for further light, but theyvolunteered no explanation.Leaving the skiff, they plunged into turmoil. Dodging through thetangle, they came out into fenced lots where tents stood wall to walland every inch was occupied. Here and there was a vacant spot guardedjealously by its owner, who gazed sourly upon all men with theforbidding eye of suspicion. Finding an eddy in the confusion, the menstopped."Where do you want to go?" they asked Miss Chester.There was no longer in Glenister's glance that freedom with which hehad come to regard the women of the North. He had come to realize dullythat here was a girl driven by some strong purpose into a positionrepellent to her. In a man of his type, her independence awoke onlyadmiration and her coldness served but to inflame him the more.Delicacy, in Glenister, was lost in a remarkable singleness of purpose.He could laugh at her loathing, smile under her abuse, and remainutterly ignorant that anything more than his action in seizing her thatnight lay at the bottom of her dislike. He did not dream that hepossessed characteristics abhorrent to her; and he felt a keenreluctance at parting.She extended both hands."I can never thank you enough for what you have done--you two; but Ishall try. Good-bye!"Dextry gazed doubtfully at his own hand, rough and gnarly, then takinghers as he would have handled a robin's egg, waggled it limply."We ain't goin' to turn you adrift this-a-way. Whatever yourdestination is, we'll see you to it.""I can find my friends," she assured him."This is the wrong latitude in which to dispute a lady, but knowin'this camp from soup to nuts, as I do, I su'gests a male escort.""Very well! I wish to find Mr. Struve, of Dunham & Struve, lawyers.""I'll take you to their offices," said Glenister. "You see to thebaggage, Dex. Meet me at the Second Class in half an hour and we'll runout to the Midas." They pushed through the tangle of tents, past pilesof lumber, and emerged upon the main thoroughfare, which ran parallelto the shore.Nome consisted of one narrow street, twisted between solid rows ofcanvas and half-erected frame buildings, its every other door that of asaloon. There were fair-looking blocks which aspired to the dizzyheight of three stories, some sheathed in corrugated iron, othersgleaming and galvanized. Lawyers' signs, doctors', surveyors', were inthe upper windows. The street was thronged with men from everyland--Helen Chester heard more dialects than she could count.Laplanders in quaint, three-cornered, padded caps idled past. Men withthe tan of the tropics rubbed elbows with yellow-haired Norsemen, andnear her a carefully groomed Frenchman with riding-breeches and monoclewas in pantomime with a skin-clad Eskimo. To her left was the sparklingsea, alive with ships of every class. To her right towered timberlessmountains, unpeopled, unexplored, forbidding, and desolate--theirhollows inlaid with snow. On one hand were the life and the world sheknew; on the other, silence, mystery, possible adventure.The roadway where she stood was a crush of sundry vehicles frombicycles to dog-hauled water-carts, and on all sides men were laboringbusily, the echo of hammers mingling with the cries of teamsters andthe tinkle of music within the saloons."And this is midnight!" exclaimed Helen, breathlessly. "Do they everrest?""There isn't time--this is a gold stampede. You haven't caught thespirit of it yet." They climbed the stairs in a huge, iron-sheetedbuilding to the office of Dunham."Anybody else here besides you?" asked her escort of the lawyer."No. I'm runnin' the law business unassisted. Don't need any help.Dunham's in Wash'n'ton, D. C., the lan' of the home, the free of thebrave. What can I do for you?"He made to cross the threshold hospitably, but tripped, plungedforward, and would have rolled down the stairs had not Glenistergathered him up and borne him back into the office, where he tossed himupon a bed in a rear room."Now what, Miss Chester?" asked the young man, returning."Isn't that dreadful?" she shuddered. "Oh, and I must see himto-night!" She stamped impatiently. "I must see him alone.""No, you mustn't," said Glenister, with equal decision. "In the firstplace, he wouldn't know what you were talking about, and in the secondplace--I know Struve. He's too drunk to talk business and too soberto--well, to see you alone.""But I MUST see him," she insisted. "It's what brought me here. Youdon't understand.""I understand more than he could. He's in no condition to act on anyimportant matter. You come around to-morrow when he's sober.""It means so much," breathed the girl. "The beast!"Glenister noted that she had not wrung her hands nor even hinted attears, though plainly her disappointment and anxiety were consuming her."Well, I suppose I'll have to wait, but I don't know where to go--somehotel, I suppose.""There aren't any. They're building two, but to-night you couldn't hirea room in Nome for money. I was about to say 'love or money.' Have youno other friends here--no women? Then you must let me find a place foryou. I have a friend whose wife will take you in."She rebelled at this. Was she never to have done with this man'sfavors? She thought of returning to the ship, but dismissed that. Sheundertook to decline his aid, but he was half-way down the stairs andpaid no attention to her beginning--so she followed him.It was then that Helen Chester witnessed her first tragedy of thefrontier, and through it came to know better the man whom she dislikedand with whom she had been thrown so fatefully. Already she hadthrilled at the spell of this country, but she had not learned thatstrength and license carry blood and violence as corollaries.Emerging from the doorway at the foot of the stairs, they driftedslowly along the walk, watching the crowd. Besides the universaltension, there were laughter and hope and exhilaration in the faces.The enthusiasm of this boyish multitude warmed one. The girl wished toget into this spirit--to be one of them. Then suddenly from the babbleat their elbows came a discordant note, not long nor loud, only a fewwords, penetrating and harsh with the metallic quality lent by passion.Helen glanced over her shoulder to find that the smiles of the throngwere gone and that its eyes were bent on some scene in the street, withan eager interest she had never seen mirrored before. SimultaneouslyGlenister spoke:"Come away from here."With the quickened eye of experience he foresaw trouble and tried todrag her on, but she shook off his grasp impatiently, and, turning,gazed absorbed at the spectacle which unfolded itself before her.Although not comprehending the play of events, she felt vaguely thequick approach of some crisis, yet was unprepared for the swiftnesswith which it came.Her eyes had leaped to the figures of two men in the street from whomthe rest had separated like oil from water. One was slim and welldressed; the other bulky, mackinawed, and lowering of feature. It wasthe smaller who spoke, and for a moment she misjudged his bloodshoteyes and swaying carriage to be the result of alcohol, until she sawthat he was racked with fury."Make good, I tell you, quick! Give me that bill of sale, you--."The unkempt man swung on his heel with a growl and walked away, hiscourse leading him towards Glenister and the girl. With two strides hewas abreast of them; then, detecting the flashing movement of theother, he whirled like a wild animal. His voice had the snarl of abeast in it."Ye had to have it, didn't ye? Well, there!"The actions of both men were quick as light, yet to the girl's tautsenses they seemed theatrical and deliberate. Into her mind was searedforever the memory of that second, as though the shutter of a camerahad snapped, impressing upon her brain the scene, sharp, clear-cut, andvivid. The shaggy back of the large man almost brushing her, therage-drunken, white shirted man in the derby hat, the crowd sweepingbackward like rushes before a blast, men with arms flexed and feetraised in flight, the glaring yellow sign of the "Gold Belt Dance Hall"across the way--these were stamped upon her retina, and then she wasjerked violently backward, two strong arms crushed her down upon herknees against the wall, and she was smothered in the arms of RoyGlenister."My God! Don't move! We're in line!"He crouched over her, his cheek against her hair, his weight forcingher down into the smallest compass, his arms about her, his bodyforming a living shield against the flying bullets. Over them the bigman stood, and the sustained roar of his gun was deafening. In aninstant they heard the thud and felt the jar of lead in the thin boardsagainst which they huddled. Again the report echoed above their heads,and they saw the slender man in the street drop his weapon and spinhalf round as though hit with some heavy hand. He uttered a cry and,stooping for his gun, plunged forward, burying his face in the sand.The man by Glenister's side shouted curses thickly, and walked towardshis prostrate enemy, firing at every step. The wounded man rolled tohis side, and, raising himself on his elbow, shot twice, so rapidlythat the reports blended--but without checking his antagonist'sapproach. Four more times the relentless assailant fired deliberately,his last missile sent as he stood over the body which twitched andshuddered at his feet, its garments muddy and smeared. Then he turnedand retraced his steps. Back within arm's-length of the two who pressedagainst the building he came, and as he went by they saw his coarse andsullen features drawn and working pallidly, while the breath whistledthrough his teeth. He held his course to the door they had justquitted, then as he turned he coughed bestially, spitting out amouthful of blood. His knees wavered. He vanished within the portalsand, in the sickly silence that fell, they heard his hob-nailed bootsclumping slowly up the stairs.Noise awoke and rioted down the thoroughfare. Men rushed forth fromevery quarter, and the ghastly object in the dirt was hidden by aseething mass of miners.Glenister raised the girl, but her head rolled limply, and she wouldhave slipped to her knees again had he not placed his arm about herwaist. Her eyes were staring and horror-filled."Don't be frightened," said he, smiling at her reassuringly; but hisown lips shook and the sweat stood out like dew on him; for they hadboth been close to death. There came a surge and swirl through thecrowd, and Dextry swooped upon them like a hawk."Be ye hurt? Holy Mackinaw! When I see 'em blaze away I yells at ye fitto bust my throat. I shore thought you was gone. Although I can't saybut this killin' was a sight for sore eyes--so neat an' genteel--still,as a rule, in these street brawls it's the innocuous bystander that hasflowers sent around to his house afterwards.""Look at this," said Glenister. Breast-high in the wall against whichthey had crouched, not three feet apart, were bullet holes."Them's the first two he unhitched," Dextry remarked, jerking his headtowards the object in the street. "Must have been a new gun an' pulledhard--throwed him to the right. See!"Even to the girl it was patent that, had she not been snatched as shewas, the bullet would have found her."Come away quick," she panted, and they led her into a near-by store,where she sank upon a seat and trembled until Dextry brought her aglass of whiskey."Here, Miss," he said. "Pretty tough go for a 'cheechako.' I'm afraidyou ain't gettin' enamoured of this here country a whole lot."For half an hour he talked to her, in his whimsical way, of foreignthings, till she was quieted. Then the partners arose to go. AlthoughGlenister had arranged for her to stop with the wife of the merchantfor the rest of the night, she would not."I can't go to bed. Please don't leave me! I'm too nervous. I'll go MADif you do. The strain of the last week has been too much for me. If Isleep I'll see the faces of those men again."Dextry talked with his companion, then made a purchase which he laid atthe lady's feet."Here's a pair of half-grown gum boots. You put 'em on an' come withus. We'll take your mind off of things complete. An' as fer sweetdreams, when you get back you'll make the slumbers of the just seem asrestless as a riot, or the antics of a mountain-goat which nimbly leapsfrom crag to crag, and--well, that's restless enough. Come on!"As the sun slanted up out of Behring Sea, they marched back towards thehills, their feet ankle-deep in the soft fresh moss, while the airtasted like a cool draught and a myriad of earthy odors rose up andencircled them. Snipe and reed birds were noisy in the hollows and fromthe misty tundra lakes came the honking of brant. After their wearyweeks on shipboard, the dewy freshness livened them magically,cleansing from their memories the recent tragedy, so that the girlbecame herself again."Where are we going?" she asked, at the end of an hour, pausing forbreath."Why, to the Midas, of course," they said; and one of them vowedrecklessly, as he drank in the beauty of her clear eyes and the graceof her slender, panting form, that he would gladly give his share ofall its riches to undo what he had done one night on the Santa Maria.CHAPTER VWHEREIN A MAN APPEARSIn the lives of countries there are crises where, for a breath,destinies lie in the laps of the gods and are jumbled, heads or tails.Thus are marked distinctive cycles like the seven ages of a man, andthough, perhaps, they are too subtle to be perceived at the time, yet,having swung past the shadowy milestones, the epochs disclosethemselves.Such a period in the progress of the Far Northwest was the nineteenthday of July, although to those concerned in the building of this newempire the day appealed only as the date of the coming of the law. AllNome gathered on the sands as lighters brought ashore Judge Stillmanand his following. It was held fitting that the Senator should be theship to safeguard the dignity of the first court and to introduceJustice into this land of the wild.The interest awakened by His Honor was augmented by the fact that hewas met on the beach by a charming girl, who flung herself upon himwith evident delight."That's his niece," said some one. "She came up on the firstboat--name's Chester--swell looker, eh?"Another new-comer attracted even more notice than the limb of the law;a gigantic, well-groomed man, with keen, close-set eyes, and thatindefinable easy movement and polished bearing that come fromconfidence, health, and travel. Unlike the others, he did not dally onthe beach nor display much interest in his surroundings; but, withpurposeful frown strode through the press, up into the heart of thecity. His companion was Struve's partner, Dunham, a middle-aged,pompous man. They went directly to the offices of Dunham & Struve,where they found the white-haired junior partner."Mighty glad to meet you, Mr. McNamara," said Struve. "Your name is ahousehold word in my part of the country. My people were mixed up inDakota politics somewhat, so I've always had a great admiration for youand I'm glad you've come to Alaska. This is a big country and we needbig men.""Did you have any trouble?" Dunham inquired when the three hadadjourned to a private room."Trouble," said Struve, ruefully; "well, I wonder if I did. MissChester brought me your instructions O.K. and I got busy right off.But, tell me this--how did you get the girl to act as messenger?""There was no one else to send," answered McNamara. "Dunham intendedsailing on the first boat, but he was detained in Washington with, me,and the Judge had to wait for us at Seattle. We were afraid to trust astranger for fear he might get curious and examine the papers. Thatwould have meant--" He moved his hand eloquently.Struve nodded. "I see. Does she know what was in the documents?""Decidedly not. Women and business don't mix. I hope you didn't tellher anything.""No; I haven't had a chance. She seemed to take a dislike to me forsome reason, I haven't seen her since the day after she got here.""The Judge told her it had something to do with preparing the way forhis court," said Dunham, "and that if the papers were not deliveredbefore he arrived it might cause a lot of trouble--litigation, riots,bloodshed, and all that. He filled her up on generalities till the girlwas frightened to death and thought the safety of her uncle and thewhole country depended on her.""Well," continued Struve, "it's dead easy to hire men to jump claimsand it's dead easy to buy their rights afterwards, particularly whenthey know they haven't got any--but what course do you follow whenowners go gunning for you?"McNamara laughed."Who did that?""A benevolent, silver-haired old Texan pirate by the name of Dextry.He's one half owner in the Midas and the other half mountain-lion; aspeaceable, you'd imagine, as a benediction, but with the temperament ofa Geronimo. I sent Galloway out to relocate the claim, and he got hisnotices up in the night when they were asleep, but at 6 A.M. he cameflying back to my room and nearly hammered the door down. I've seenfright in varied forms and phases, but he had them all, with some addedstarters."'Hide me out, quick!' he panted."'What's up?' I asked."'I've stirred up a breakfast of grizzly bear, smallpox, and suddendeath and it don't set well on my stummick. Let me in.'"I had to keep him hidden three days, for this gentle-mannered oldcannibal roamed the streets with a cannon in his hand, breathing fireand pestilence.""Anybody else act up?" queried Dunham."No; all the rest are Swedes and they haven't got the nerve to fight.They couldn't lick a spoon if they tried. These other men aredifferent, though. There are two of them, the old one and a youngfellow. I'm a little afraid to mix it up with them, and if their claimwasn't the best in the district, I'd say let it alone.""I'll attend to that," said McNamara.Struve resumed:"Yes, gentlemen, I've been working pretty hard and also pretty much inthe dark so far. I'm groping for light. When Miss Chester brought inthe papers I got busy instanter. I clouded the title to the richestplacers in the region, but I'm blamed if I quite see the use of it.We'd be thrown out of any court in the land if we took them to law.What's the game--blackmail?""Humph!" ejaculated McNamara. "What do you take me for?""Well, it does seem small for Alec McNamara, but I can't see what elseyou're up to.""Within a week I'll be running every good mine in the Nome district."McNamara's voice was calm but decisive, his glance keen and alert,while about him clung such a breath of power and confidence that itcompelled belief even in the face of this astounding speech.In spite of himself, Wilton Struve, lawyer, rake, and gentlemanlyadventurer, felt his heart leap at what the other's daring implied. Theproposition was utterly past belief, and yet, looking into the man'spurposeful eyes, he believed."That's big--awful big--TOO big," the younger man murmured. "Why, man,it means you'll handle fifty thousand dollars a day!"Dunham shifted his feet in the silence and licked his dry lips."Of course it's big, but Mr. McNamara's the biggest man that ever cameto Alaska," he said."And I've got the biggest scheme that ever came north, backed by thebiggest men in Washington," continued the politician. "Look here!" Hedisplayed a type-written sheet bearing parallel lists of names andfigures. Struve gasped incredulously."Those are my stockholders and that is their share in the venture. Oh,yes; we're incorporated--under the laws of Arizona--secret, of course;it would never do for the names to get out. I'm showing you this onlybecause I want you to be satisfied who's behind me.""Lord! I'm satisfied," said Struve, laughing nervously. "Dunham waswith you when you figured the scheme out and he met some of yourfriends in Washington and New York. If he says it's all right, thatsettles it. But say, suppose anything went wrong with the company andit leaked out who those stockholders are?""There's no danger. I have the books where they will be burned at thefirst sign. We'd have had our own land laws passed but for Sturtevantof Nevada, damn him. He blocked us in the Senate. However, my plan isthis." He rapidly outlined his proposition to the listeners, while alight of admiration grew and shone in the reckless face of Struve."By heavens! you're a wonder!" he cried, at the close, "and I'm withyou body and soul. It's dangerous--that's why I like it.""Dangerous?" McNamara shrugged his shoulders. "Bah! Where is thedanger? We've got the law--or rather, we ARE the law. Now, let's get towork."It seemed that the Boss of North Dakota was no sluggard. He discardedcoat and waistcoat and tackled the documents which Struve laid beforehim, going through them like a whirlwind. Gradually he infected theothers with his energy, and soon behind the locked doors of Dunham &Struve there were only haste and fever and plot and intrigue.As Helen Chester led the Judge towards the flamboyant, three-storiedhotel she prattled to him light-heartedly. The fascination of a newland already held her fast, and now she felt, in addition, security andrelief. Glenister saw them from a distance and strode forward to greetthem.He beheld a man of perhaps threescore years, benign of aspect save forthe eyes, which were neither clear nor steady, but had the trick oflooking past one. Glenister thought the mouth, too, rather weak andvacillating; but the clean-shaven face was dignified by learning aacumen and was wrinkled in pleasant fashion."My niece has just told me of your service to her," the old gentlemanbegan. "I am happy to know you, sir.""Besides being a brave knight and assisting ladies in distress, Mr.Glenister is a very great and wonderful man," Helen explained, lightly."He owns the Midas.""Indeed!" said the old man, his shifting eyes now resting full on theother with a flash of unmistakable interest. "I hear that is awonderful mine. Have you begun work yet?""No. We'll commence sluicing day after to-morrow. It has been a latespring. The snow in the gulch was deep and the ground thaws slowly.We've been building houses and doing dead work, but we've got our menon the ground, waiting.""I am greatly interested. Won't you walk with us to the hotel? I wantto hear more about these wonderful placers.""Well, they ARE great placers," said the miner, as the three walked ontogether; "nobody knows HOW great because we've only scratched at themyet. In the first place the ground is so shallow and the gold is soeasy to get, that if nature didn't safeguard us in the winter we'dnever dare leave our claims for fear of 'snipers.' They'd run in androb us.""How much will the Anvil Creek mines produce this summer?" asked theJudge."It's hard to tell, sir; but we expect to average five thousand a dayfrom the Midas alone, and there are other claims just as good.""Your title is all clear, I dare say, eh?""Absolutely, except for one jumper, and we don't take him seriously. Afellow named Galloway relocated us one night last month, but he didn'tallege any grounds for doing so, and we could never find trace of him.If we had, our title would be as clean as snow again." He said the lastwith a peculiar inflection."You wouldn't use violence, I trust?""Sure! Why not? It has worked all right heretofore.""But, my dear sir, those days are gone. The law is here and it is theduty of every one to abide by it.""Well, perhaps it is; but in this country we consider a man's mine assacred as his family. We didn't know what a lock and key were in theearly times and we didn't have any troubles except famine and hardship.It's different now, though. Why, there have been more claims jumpedaround here this spring than in the whole length and history of theYukon."They had reached the hotel, and Glenister paused, turning to the girlas the Judge entered. When she started to follow, he detained her."I came down from the hills on purpose to see you. It has been a longweek--""Don't talk that way," she interrupted, coldly. "I don't care to hearit.""See here--what makes you shut me out and wrap yourself up in yourhaughtiness? I'm sorry for what I did that night--I've told you sorepeatedly. I've wrung my soul for that act till there's nothing leftbut repentance.""It is not that," she said, slowly. "I have been thinking it overduring the past month, and now that I have gained an insight into thislife I see that it wasn't an unnatural thing for you to do. It'sterrible to think of, but it's true. I don't mean that it waspardonable," she continued, quickly, "for it wasn't, and I hate youwhen I think about it, but I suppose I put myself into a position toinvite such actions. No; I'm sufficiently broad-minded not to blame youunreasonably, and I think I could like you in spite of it, just forwhat you have done for me; but that isn't all. There is somethingdeeper. You saved my life and I'm grateful, but you frighten me,always. It is the cruelty in your strength, it is something away backin you--lustful, and ferocious, and wild, and crouching."He smiled wryly."It is my local color, maybe--absorbed from this country. I'll try tochange, though, if you want me to. I'll let them rope and throw andbrand me. I'll take on the graces of civilization and put away revengeand ambition and all the rest of it, if it will make you like me anybetter. Why, I'll even promise not to violate the person of ourclaim-jumper if I catch him; and Heaven knows THAT means that Samsonhas parted with his locks.""I think I could like you if you did," she said, "but you can't do it.You are a savage." There are no clubs nor marts where men foregather for business inthe North--nothing but the saloon, and this is all and more than aclub. Here men congregate to drink, to gamble, and to traffic.It was late in the evening when Glenister entered the Northern andpassed idly down the row of games, pausing at the crap-table, where herolled the dice when his turn came. Moving to the roulette-wheel, helost a stack of whites, but at the faro "lay-out" his luck was better,and he won a gold coin on the "high-card." Whereupon he promptlyordered a round of drinks for the men grouped about him, a formalityalways precedent to overtures of general friendship.As he paused, glass in hand, his eyes were drawn to a man who stoodclose by, talking earnestly. The aspect of the stranger challengednotice, for he stood high above his companions with a peculiar grace ofattitude in place of the awkwardness common in men of great stature.Among those who were listening intently to the man's carefullymodulated tones, Glenister recognized Mexico Mullins, the ex-gamblerwho had given Dextry the warning at Unalaska. As he further studied thelistening group, a drunken man staggered uncertainly through the widedoors of the saloon and, gaining sight of the tall stranger, blinked,then approached him, speaking with a loud voice:"Well, if 'tain't ole Alec McNamara! How do, ye ole pirate!"McNamara nodded and turned his back coolly upon the new-comer."Don't turn your dorsal fin to me; I wan' to talk to ye."McNamara continued his calm discourse till he received a vicious whackon the shoulder; then he turned for a moment to interrupt hisassailant's garrulous profanity:"Don't bother me. I am engaged.""Ye won' talk to me, eh? Well, I'm goin' to talk to YOU, see? I guessyou'd listen if I told these people all I know about you. Turn aroundhere."His voice was menacing and attracted general notice. Observing this,McNamara addressed him, his words dropping clear, concise, and cold:"Don't talk to me. You are a drunken nuisance. Go away before somethinghappens to you."Again he turned away, but the drunken man seized and whirled him about,repeating his abuse, encouraged by this apparent patience."Your pardon for an instant, gentlemen." McNamara laid a large whiteand manicured hand upon the flannel sleeve of the miner and gentlyescorted him through the entrance to the sidewalk, while the crowdsmiled.As they cleared the threshold, however, he clenched his fist without aword and, raising it, struck the sot fully and cruelly upon the jaw.His victim fell silently, the back of his head striking the boards witha hollow thump; then, without even observing how he lay, McNamarare-entered the saloon and took up his conversation where he had beeninterrupted. His voice was as evenly regulated as his movements,betraying not a sign of anger, excitement, or bravado. He lit acigarette, extracted a note-book, and jotted down certain memorandasupplied him by Mexico Mullins.All this time the body lay across the threshold without a sign of life.The buzz of the roulette-wheel was resumed and the crap-dealer beganhis monotonous routine. Every eye was fixed on the nonchalant man atthe bar, but the unconscious creature outside the threshold layunheeded, for in these men's code it behooves the most humane topractise a certain aloofness in the matter of private brawls.Having completed his notes, McNamara shook hands gravely with hiscompanions and strode out through the door, past the bulk that sprawledacross his path, and, without pause or glance, disappeared.A dozen willing, though unsympathetic, hands laid the drunkard on theroulette-table, where the bartender poured pitcher upon pitcher ofwater over him."He ain't hurt none to speak of," said a bystander; then added, withenthusiasm:"But say! There's a MAN in this here camp!"CHAPTER VIAND A MINE IS JUMPED"Who's your new shift boss?" Glenister inquired of his partner, a fewdays later, indicating a man in the cut below, busied in setting a lineof sluices."That's old 'Slapjack' Simms, friend of mine from up Dawson way."Glenister laughed immoderately, for the object was unusually tall andloose-jointed, and wore a soiled suit of yellow mackinaw. He had laidoff his coat, and now the baggy, bilious trousers hung precariouslyfrom his angular shoulders by suspenders of alarming frailty. His legswere lost in gum boots, also loose and cavernous, and his entirecostume looked relaxed and flapping, so that he gave the impression ofbeing able to shake himself out of his raiment, and to rise like aburlesque Aphrodite. His face was overgrown with a grizzled tangle thatlooked as though it had been trimmed with button-hole scissors, whileabove the brush heap grandly soared a shiny, dome-like head."Has he always been bald?""Naw! He ain't bald at all. He shaves his nob. In the early days hewore a long flowin' mane which was inhabited by crickets, tree-toads,and such fauna. It got to be a hobby with him finally, so that hegrowed superstitious about goin' uncurried, and would back into acorner with both guns drawed if a barber came near him. But onceHank--that's his real name--undertook to fry some slapjacks, and ingivin' the skillet a heave, the dough lit among his forest primeval,jest back of his ears, soft side down. Hank polluted the gulch withlangwidge which no man had ought to keep in himself without it wasfumigated. Disreppitableness oozed out through him like sweat throughan ice-pitcher, an' since then he's been known as Slapjack Simms, an'has kept his head shingled smooth as a gun bar'l. He's a good miner,though; ain't none better--an' square as a die."Sluicing had begun on the Midas. Long sinuous lengths of canvas hosewound down the creek bottom from the dam, like gigantic serpents, whilethe roll of gravel through the flumes mingled musically with the rushof waters, the tinkle of tools, and the song of steel on rock. Therewere four "strings" of boxes abreast, and the heaving line ofshovellers ate rapidly into the creek bed, while teams with scraperssplashed through the tail races in an atmosphere of softened profanity.In the big white tents which sat back from the bluffs, fifty men of thenight shift were asleep; for there is no respite here--no night, noSunday, no halt, during the hundred days in which the Northland lendsherself to pillage.The mine lay cradled between wonderful, mossy, willow-mottledmountains, while above and below the gulch was dotted with tents andhuts, and everywhere, from basin to hill crest, men dug and blasted,punily, patiently, while their tracks grew daily plainer over the faceof this inscrutable wilderness.A great contentment filled the two partners as they looked on thisscene. To wrest from reluctant earth her richest treasures, to add tothe wealth of the world, to create--here was satisfaction."We ain't robbin' no widders an' orphans doin' it, neither," Dextrysuddenly remarked, expressing his partner's feelings closely. Theylooked at each other and smiled with that rare understanding thatexceeds words.Descending into the cut, the old man filled a gold-pan with dirt takenfrom under the feet of the workers, and washed it in a puddle, whilethe other watched his dexterous whirling motions. When he had finished,they poked the stream of yellow grains into a pile, then, with headstogether, guessed its weight, laughing again delightedly, in perfectharmony and contentment."I've been waitin' a turrible time fer this day," said the elder. "I'vesuffered the plagues of prospectin' from the Mexicos to the Circle, an'yet I don't begretch it none, now that I've struck pay."While they spoke, two miners struggled with a bowlder they hadunearthed, and having scraped and washed it carefully, staggered backto place it on the cleaned bed-rock behind. One of them slipped, and itcrashed against a brace which held the sluices in place. These boxesstand more than a man's height above the bed-rock, resting onsupporting posts and running full of water. Should a sluice fall, therushing stream carries out the gold which has lodged in the riffles andfloods the bed-rock, raising havoc. Too late the partners saw thestring of boxes sway and bend at the joint. Then, before they couldreach the threatened spot to support it, Slapjack Simms, with a shriek,plunged flapping down into the cut and seized the flume. His greatheight stood him in good stead now, for where the joint had opened,water poured forth in a cataract, He dived under the breachunhesitatingly and, stooping, lifted the line as near to its formerlevel as possible, holding the entire burden upon his naked pate. Hegesticulated wildly for help, while over him poured the deluge of icy,muddy water. It entered his gaping waistband, bulging out his yellowtrousers till they were fat and full and the seams were bursting, whilehis yawning boot-tops became as boiling springs. Meanwhile he chatteredforth profanity in such volume that the ear ached under it as must haveached the heroic Slapjack under the chill of the melting snow. He wasrelieved quickly, however, and emerged triumphant, though blue andpuckered, his wilderness of whiskers streaming like limber stalactites,his boots loosely "squishing," while oaths still poured from him insuch profusion that Dextry whispered:"Ain't he a ring-tailed wonder? It's plumb solemn an' reverent the wayhe makes them untamed cuss-words sit up an' beg. It's a privilege to bepresent. That's a GIFT, that is.""You'd better get some dry clothes," they suggested, and Slapjackproceeded a few paces towards the tents, hobbling as though treading onpounded glass."Ow--w!" he yelled. "These blasted boots is full of gravel."He seated himself and tugged at his foot till the boot came away with asucking sound, then, instead of emptying the accumulation at random, hepoured the contents into Dextry's empty gold-pan, rinsing it outcarefully. The other boot he emptied likewise. They held a surprisingamount of sediment, because the stream that had emerged from the crackin the sluices had carried with it pebbles, sand, and all theconcentration of the riffles at this point. Standing directly beneaththe cataract, most of it had dived fairly into his inviting waistband,following down the lines of least resistance into his boot-legs andboiling out at the knees."Wash that," he said. "You're apt to get a prospect."With artful passes Dextry settled it in the pan bottom and washed awaythe gravel, leaving a yellow, glittering pile which raised a yell fromthe men who had lingered curiously."He pans forty dollars to the boot-leg," one shouted."How much do you run to the foot, Slapjack?""He's a reg'lar free-milling ledge.""No, he ain't--he's too thin. He's nothing but a stringer, but he'llpay to work."The old miner grinned toothlessly."Gentlemen, there ain't no better way to save fine gold than withundercurrents an' blanket riffles. I'll have to wash these garments ofmine an' clean up the soapsuds 'cause there's a hundred dollars ingold-dust clingin' to my person this minute." He went dripping up thebank, while the men returned to their work singing.After lunch Dextry saddled his bronco."I'm goin' to town for a pair of gold-scales, but I'll be back bysupper, then we'll clean up between shifts. She'd ought to give us athousand ounces, the way that ground prospects." He loped down thegulch, while his partner returned to the pit, the flashing shovelblades, and the rumbling undertone of the big workings that sofascinated him. It was perhaps four o'clock when he was aroused fromhis labors by a shout from the bunk-tent, where a group of horsemen hadclustered. As Glenister drew near, he saw among them Wilton Struve, thelawyer, and the big, well-dressed tenderfoot of theNorthern--McNamara--the man of the heavy hand. Struve straightwayengaged him."Say, Glenister, we've come out to see about the title to this claim.""What about it?""Well, it was relocated about a month ago." He paused."Yes. What of that?""Galloway has commenced suit.""The ground belongs to Dextry and me. We discovered it, we opened itup, we've complied with the law, and we're going to hold it." Glenisterspoke with such conviction and heat as to nonplus Struve, but McNamara,who had sat his horse silently until now, answered:"Certainly, sir; if your title is good you will be protected, but thelaw has arrived in Alaska and we've got to let it take its course.There's no need of violence--none whatever--but, briefly, the situationis this: Mr. Galloway has commenced action against you; the court hasenjoined you from working and has appointed me as receiver to operatethe mine until the suit is settled. It's an extraordinary procedure, ofcourse, but the conditions are extraordinary in this country. Theseason is so short that it would be unjust to the rightful owner if theclaim lay idle all summer--so, to avoid that, I've been put in charge,with instructions to operate it and preserve the proceeds subject tothe court's order. Mr. Voorhees here is the United States Marshal. Hewill serve the papers."Glenister threw up his hand in a gesture of restraint."Hold on! Do you mean to tell me that any court would recognize such aclaim as Galloway's?""The law recognizes everything. If his grounds are no good, so much thebetter for you.""You can't put in a receiver without notice to us. Why, good Lord! wenever heard of a suit being commenced. We've never even been servedwith a summons and we haven't had a chance to argue in our own defence.""I have just said that this is a remarkable state of affairs andunusual action had to be taken," McNamara replied, but the young minergrew excited."Look here--this gold won't get away. It's safe in the ground. We'llknock off work and let the claim lie idle till the thing is settled.You can't really expect us to surrender possession of our mine on themere allegation of some unknown man. That's ridiculous. We won't do it.Why, you'll have to let us argue our case, at least, before you try toput us off."Voorhees shook his head. "We'll have to follow instructions. The thingfor you to do is to appear before the court to-morrow and have thereceiver dismissed. If your title is as good as you say it is, youwon't have any trouble.""You're not the only ones to suffer," added McNamara. "We've takenpossession of all the mines below here." He nodded down the gulch. "I'man officer of the court and under bond--""How much?""Five thousand dollars for each claim.""What! Why, heavens, man, the poorest of these mines is producing thatmuch every day!"While he spoke, Glenister was rapidly debating what course to follow."The place to argue this thing is before Judge Stillman," saidStruve--but with little notion of the conflict going on withinGlenister. The youth yearned to fight--not with words nor quibbles norlegal phrases, but with steel and blows. And he felt that the impulsewas as righteous as it was natural, for he knew this process wasunjust, an outrage. Mexico Mullins's warning recurred to him. Andyet--. He shifted slowly as he talked till his back was to the door ofthe big tent. They were watching him carefully, for all their apparentlanguor and looseness in saddle; then as he started to leap within andrally his henchmen, his mind went back to the words of Judge Stillmanand his niece. Surely that old man was on the square. He couldn't beotherwise with her beside him, believing in him; and a suspicion ofdeeper plots behind these actions was groundless. So far, all waslegal, he supposed, with his scant knowledge of law; though the methodsseemed unreasonable. The men might be doing what they thought to beright. Why be the first to resist? The men on the mines below had notdone so. The title to this ground was capable of such easy proof thathe and Dex need have no uneasiness. Courts do not rob honest peoplenowadays, he argued, and moreover, perhaps the girl's words were true,perhaps she WOULD think more of him if he gave up the old fighting waysfor her sake. Certainly armed resistance to her uncle's first edictwould not please her. She had said he was too violent, so he would showher he could lay his savagery aside. She might smile on himapprovingly, and that was worth taking a chance for--anyway it wouldmean but a few days' delay in the mine's run. As he reasoned he heard alow voice speaking within the open door. It was Slapjack Simms."Step aside, lad. I've got the big un covered."Glenister saw the men on horseback snatch at their holsters, and, justin time, leaped at his foreman, for the old man had moved out into theopen, a Winchester at shoulder, his cheek cuddling the stock, his eyescold and narrow. The young man flung the barrel up and wrenched theweapon from his hands."None of that, Hank!" he cried, sharply. "I'll say when to shoot." Heturned to look into the muzzles of guns held in the hands of everyhorseman--every horseman save one, for Alec McNamara sat unmoved, hishandsome features, nonchalant and amused, nodding approval. It was athim that Hank's weapon had been levelled."This is bad enough at the best. Don't let's make it any worse," saidhe.Slapjack inhaled deeply, spat with disgust, and looked over his bossincredulously."Well, of all the different kinds of damn fools," he snorted, "you arethe kindest." He marched past the marshal and his deputies down to thecut, put on his coat, and vanished down the trail towards town, notdeigning a backward glance either at the mine or at the man unfit tofight for.CHAPTER VIITHE "BRONCO KID'S" EAVESDROPPINGLate in July it grows dark as midnight approaches, so that the manylights from doorway and window seem less garish and strange than theydo a month earlier. In the Northern there was good business doing. Thenew bar fixtures, which had cost a king's ransom, or represented theone night's losings of a Klondike millionaire, shone rich, dark, andenticing, while the cut glass sparkled with iridescent hues,reflecting, in a measure, the prismatic moods, the dancing spirits ofthe crowd that crushed past, halting at the gambling games, orpatronizing the theatre in the rear. The old bar furniture, broughtdown by dog team from "Up River," was established at the rear extremityof the long building, just inside the entrance to the dancehall, wherepatrons of the drama might, with a modicum of delay and inconvenience,quaff as deeply of the beaker as of the ballet.Now, however, the show had closed, the hall had been cleared of chairsand canvas, exposing a glassy, tempting surface, and the orchestra hadmoved to the stage. They played a rollicking, blood-stirring two-step,while the floor swam with dancers.At certain intervals the musicians worked feverishly up to a crashingcrescendo, supported by the voices of the dancers, until all joined atthe top note in a yell, while the drummer fired a .44 Colt into a boxof wet sawdust beside his chair--all in time, all in the swingingspirit of the tune.The men, who were mostly young, danced like college boys, while thewomen, who were all young and good dancers, floated through themeasures with the ease of rose-leaves on a summer stream. Faces wereflushed, eyes were bright, and but rarely a voice sounded that was notglad. Most of the noise came from the men, and although one caught,here and there, a hint of haggard lines about the girlish faces, andglimpsed occasional eyes that did not smile, yet as a whole the scenewas one of genuine enjoyment.Suddenly the music ceased and the couples crowded to the bar. The womentook harmless drinks, the men, mostly whiskey. Rarely was the choice ofpotations criticised, though occasionally some ruddy eschewer ofsobriety insisted that his lady "take the same," avowing that "hootch,"having been demonstrated beneficial in his case, was good for her also.Invariably the lady accepted without dispute, and invariably the manfailed to note her glance at the bartender, or the silent substitutionby that capable person of ginger-ale for whiskey or of plain water forgin. In turn, the mixers collected one dollar from each man, flippingto the girl a metal percentage-check which she added to her store. Inthe curtained boxes overhead, men bought bottles with foil about thecorks, and then subterfuge on the lady's part was idle, but, on theother hand, she was able to pocket for each bottle a check redeemableat five dollars.A stranger, straight from the East, would have remarked first upon thegood music, next upon the good looks of the women, and then upon theshabby clothes of the men--for some of them were in "mukluk," others insweaters with huge initials and winged emblems, and all were collarless.Outside in the main gambling-room there were but few women. Men crowdedin dense masses about the faro lay-out, the wheel, craps, the Klondikegame, pangingi, and the card-tables. They talked of business, of home,of women, bought and sold mines, and bartered all things from hams tohonor. The groomed and clean, the unkempt and filthy jostled shoulderto shoulder, equally affected by the license of the goldfields and theexhilaration of the New. The mystery of the North had touched them all.The glad, bright wine of adventure filled their veins, and they spokemightily of things they had resolved to do, or recounted with simplediffidence the strange stories of their accomplishment.The "Bronco Kid," familiar from Atlin to Nome as the best "bank" dealeron the Yukon, worked the shift from eight till two. He was a slenderman of thirty, dexterous in movement, slow to smile, soft of voice, andknown as a living flame among women. He had dealt the biggest games ofthe early days, and had no enemies. Yet, though many called him friend,they wondered inwardly.It was a strong play the Kid had to-night, for Swede Sam, of Dawson,ventured many stacks of yellow chips, and he was a quick, aggressivegambler. A Jew sat at the king end with ten neatly creasedone-thousand-dollar bills before him, together with piles of smallercurrency. He adventured viciously and without system, while outsidersto the number of four or five cut in sporadically with small bets. Thegame was difficult to follow; consequently the lookout, from his raiseddais, was leaning forward, chin in hand, while the group was hedgedabout by eager on-lookers.Faro is a closed book to most people, for its intricacies areconfusing. Lucky is he who has never persevered in solving itsmysteries nor speculated upon the "systems" of beating it. From thosewho have learned it, the game demands practice, dexterity, andcoolness. The dealer must run the cards, watch the many shifting bets,handle the neatly piled checks, figure, lightning-like, the profits andlosses. It was his unerring, clock like regularity in this that had wonthe Kid his reputation. This night his powers were taxed. He dealtsilently, scowlingly, his long white fingers nervously caressing thecards.This preoccupation prevented his noticing the rustle and stir of anew-comer who had crowded up behind him, until he caught the wonderingglances of those in front and saw that the Israelite was staring pasthim, his money forgotten, his eyes beady and sharp, his rat-like teethshowing in a grin of admiration. Swede Sam glared from under hisunkempt shock and felt uncertainly towards the open collar of hisflannel shirt where a kerchief should have been. The men who werestanding gazed at the new-comer, some with surprise, others with a halfsmile of recognition.Bronco glanced quickly over his shoulder, and as he did so the breathcaught in his throat--but for only an instant. A girl stood so closebeside him that the lace of her gown brushed his sleeve. He wasshuffling at the moment and dropped a card, then nodded to her.speaking quietly, as he stooped to regain the pasteboard:"Howdy, Cherry?"She did not answer--only continued to look at the "lay-out." "What awoman!" he thought. She was not too tall, with smoothly rounded bustand hips, and long waist, all well displayed by her perfectly fittinggarments. Her face was oval, the mouth rather large, the eyes of dark,dark-blue, prominently outlined under thin, silken lids. Her dull-goldhair was combed low over the ears, and her smile showed rows ofsparkling teeth before it dived into twin dimples. Strangest of all, itwas an innocent face, the face and smile of a school-girl.The Kid finished his shuffling awkwardly and slid the cards into thebox. Then the woman spoke:"Let me have your place, Bronco."The men gasped, the Jew snickered, the lookout straightened in hischair."Better not. It's a hard game," said the Kid, but her voice wasimperious as she commanded him:"Hurry up. Give me your place."Bronco arose, whereupon she settled in his chair, tucked in her skirts,removed her gloves, and twisted into place the diamonds on her hands."What the devil's this?" said the lookout, roughly. "Are you drunk,Bronco? Get out of that chair, miss."She turned to him slowly. The innocence had fled from her features andthe big eyes flashed warningly. A change had coarsened her like a puffof air on a still pool. Then, while she stared at him, her lids droopeddangerously and her lip curled."Throw him out, Bronco," she said, and her tones held the hardness of amistress to her slave."That's all right," the Kid reassured the lookout. "She's a betterdealer than I am. This is Cherry Malotte."Without noticing the stares this evoked, the girl commenced. Her hands,beautifully soft and white, flashed over the board. She dealt rapidly,unfalteringly, with the finish of one bred to the cards, handling chipsand coppers with the peculiar mannerisms that spring from longpractice. It was seen that she never looked at her check-rack, but,when a bet required paying, picked up a stack without turning her head;and they saw further that she never reached twice, nor took a largepile and sized it up against its mate, removing the extra disks, as isthe custom. When she stretched forth her hand she grasped the rightnumber unerringly. This is considered the acme of professional finish,and the Bronco Kid smiled delightedly as he saw the wonder spread fromthe lookout to the spectators and heard the speech of the men who stoodon chairs and tables for sight of the woman dealer.For twenty minutes she continued, until the place became congested, andnever once did the lookout detect an error.While she was busy, Glenister entered the front-door and pushed his wayback towards the theatre. He was worried and distrait, his mannerperturbed and unnatural. Silently and without apparent notice he passedfriends who greeted him."What ails Glenister to-night?" asked a by-stander. "He acts funny,""Ain't you heard? Why, the Midas has been jumped. He's in a badway--all broke up."The girl suddenly ceased without finishing the deck, and arose."Don't stop," said the Kid, while a murmur of dismay came from thespectators. She only shook her head and drew on her gloves with a showof ennui.Gliding through the crowd, she threaded about aimlessly, the recipientof many stares though but few greetings, speaking with no one, acertain dignity serving her as a barrier even here. She stopped awaiter and questioned him."He's up-stairs in a gallery box.""Alone?""Yes'm. Anyhow, he was a minute ago, unless some of the rustlers hasbroke in on him."A moment later Glenister, watching the scene below, was aroused fromhis gloomy absorption by the click of the box door and the rustle ofsilken skirts."Go out, please," he said, without turning. "I don't want company."Hearing no answer, he began again, "I came here to be alone"--but therehe ceased, for the girl had come forward and laid her two hot handsupon his cheeks."Boy," she breathed--and he arose swiftly."Cherry! When did you come?""Oh, DAYS ago," she said, impatiently, "from Dawson. They told me youhad struck it. I stood it as long as I could--then I came to you. Now,tell me about yourself. Let me see you first, quick!"She pulled him towards the light and gazed upward, devouring himhungrily with her great, languorous eyes. She held to his coat lapels,standing close beside him, her warm breath beating up into his face."Well," she said, "kiss me!"He took her wrists in his and loosed her hold, then looked down on hergravely and said:"No--that's all over. I told you so when I left Dawson.""All over! Oh no, it isn't, boy. You think so, but it isn't--it can'tbe. I love you too much to let you go.""Hush!" said he. "There are people in the next box.""I don't care! Let them hear," she cried, with feminine recklessness."I'm proud of my love for you. I'll tell it to them--to the wholeworld.""Now, see here, little girl," he said, quietly, "we had a long talk inDawson and agreed that it was best to divide our ways. I was mad overyou once, as a good many other men have been, but I came to my senses.Nothing could ever result from it, and I told you so.""Yes, yes--I know. I thought I could give you up, but I didn't realizetill you had gone how I wanted you. Oh, it's been a TORTURE to me everyday for the past two years." There was no semblance now to the coldcreature she had appeared upon entering the gambling-hall. She spokerapidly, her whole body tense with emotion, her voice shaken withpassion. "I've seen men and men and men, and they've loved me, but Inever cared for anybody in the world till I saw you. They ran after me,but you were cold. You made me come to you. Perhaps that was it.Anyhow, I can't stand it. I'll give up everything--I'll do anythingjust to be where you are. What do you think of a woman who will beg?Oh, I've lost my pride--I'm a fool--a fool--but I can't help it.""I'm sorry you feel this way," said Glenister. "It isn't my fault, andit isn't of any use."For an instant she stood quivering, while the light died out of herface; then, with a characteristic change, she smiled till the dimpleslaughed in her cheeks. She sank upon a seat beside him and pulledtogether the curtains, shutting out the sight below."Very well"--then she put his hand to her cheek and cuddled it. "I'mglad to see you just the same, and you can't keep me from loving you."With his other hand he smoothed her hair, while, unknown to him andbeneath her lightness, she shrank and quivered at his touch like aBarbary steed under the whip."Things are very bad with me," he said. "We've had our mine jumped.""Bah! You know what to do. You aren't a cripple--you've got fivefingers on your gun hand.""That's it! They all tell me that--all the old-timers; but I don't knowwhat to do. I thought I did--but I don't. The law has come into thiscountry and I've tried to meet it half-way. They jumped us and put in areceiver--a big man--by the name of McNamara. Dex wasn't there and Ilet them do it. When the old man learned of it he nearly went crazy. Wehad our first quarrel. He thought I was afraid--""Not he," said the girl. "I know him and he knows you.""That was a week ago. We've hired the best lawyer in Nome--BillWheaton--and we've tried to have the injunction removed. We've offeredbond in any sum, but the Judge refuses to accept it. We've argued forleave to appeal, but he won't give us the right. The more I look intoit the worse it seems, for the court wasn't convened in accordance withlaw, we weren't notified to appear in our own behalf, we weren'tallowed a chance to argue our own case--nothing. They simply slapped ona receiver, and now they refuse to allow us redress. From a legalstand-point, it's appalling, I'm told--but what's to be done? What'sthe game? That's the thing. What are they up to? I'm nearly out of mymind, for it's all my fault. I didn't think it meant anything like thisor I'd have made a fight for possession and stood them off at least. Asit is, my partner's sore and he's gone to drinking--first time intwelve years. He says I gave the claim away, and now it's up to me andthe Almighty to get it back. If he gets full he'll drive a four-horsewagon into some church, or go up and pick the Judge to pieces with hisfingers to see what makes him go round.""What've they got against you and Dextry--some grudge?" she questioned."No, no! We're not the only ones in trouble; they've jumped the rest ofthe good mines and put this McNamara in as receiver on all of them, butthat's small comfort. The Swedes are crazy; they've hired all thelawyers in town, and are murdering more good American language thanwould fill Bering Strait. Dex is in favor of getting our friendstogether and throwing the receiver off. He wants to kill somebody, butwe can't do that. They've got the soldiers to fall back on. We've beenwarned that the troops are instructed to enforce the court's action. Idon't know what the plot is, for I can't believe the old Judge iscrooked--the girl wouldn't let him.""Girl?"Cherry Malotte leaned forward where the light shone on the young man'sworried face."The girl? What girl? Who is she?"Her voice had lost its lazy caress, her lips had thinned. Never was awoman's face more eloquent, mused Glenister as he noted her. Everythought fled to this window to peer forth, fearful, lustful, hateful,as the case might be. He had loved to play with her in the former days,to work upon her passions and watch the changes, to note her featuresmirror every varying emotion from tenderness to flippancy, from angerto delight, and, at his bidding, to see the pale cheeks glow withlove's fire, the eyes grow heavy, the dainty lips invite kisses. Cherrywas a perfect little spoiled animal, he reflected, and a very dangerousone."What girl?" she questioned again, and he knew beforehand the look thatwent with it."The girl I intend to marry," he said, slowly, looking her between theeyes.He knew he was cruel--he wanted to be--it satisfied the clamor andturmoil within him, while he also felt that the sooner she knew and thecolder it left her the better. He could not note the effect of theremark on her, however, for, as he spoke, the door of the box openedand the head of the Bronco Kid appeared, then retired instantly withapologies."Wrong stall," he said, in his slow voice. "Looking for another party."Nevertheless, his eyes had covered every inch of them--noted the drawncurtains and the breathless poise of the woman--while his ears hadcaught part of Glenister's speech."You won't marry her," said Cherry, quietly. "I don't know who she is,but I won't let you marry her."She rose and smoothed her skirts."It's time nice people were going now." She said it with a sneer atherself. "Take me out through this crowd. I'm living quietly and Idon't want these beasts to follow me."As they emerged from the theatre the morning air was cool and quiet,while the sun was just rising. The Bronco Kid lighted a cigar as theypassed, nodding silently at their greeting. His eyes followed them,while his hands were so still that the match burned through to hisfingers--then when they had gone his teeth met and ground savagelythrough the tobacco so that the cigar fell, while he muttered:"So that's the girl you intend to marry? We'll see, by God!"CHAPTER VIIIDEXTRY MAKES A CALLThe water front had a strong attraction for Helen Chester, and rarelydid a fair day pass without finding her in some quiet spot from whichshe could watch the shifting life along its edge, the ships at anchor,and the varied incidents of the surf.This morning she sat in a dory pulled high up on the beach, bathed inthe bright sunshine, and staring at the rollers, while lines ofconcentration wrinkled her brow. The wind had blown for some days tillthe ocean beat heavily across the shallow bar, and now, as it becamequieter, longshoremen were launching their craft, preparing to resumetheir traffic.Not until the previous day had the news of her friends' misfortune cometo her, and although she had heard no hint of fraud, she began torealize that they were involved in a serious tangle. To the questionswhich she anxiously put to her uncle he had replied that theirdifficulty arose from a technicality in the mining laws which anotherman had been shrewd enough to profit by. It was a complicated question,he said, and one requiring time to thrash out to an equitablesettlement. She had undertaken to remind him of the service these menhad done her, but, with a smile, he interrupted; he could not allowsuch things to influence his judicial attitude, and she must notendeavor to prejudice him in the discharge of his duty. Recognizing thejustice of this, she had desisted.For many days the girl had caught scattered talk between the Judge andMcNamara, and between Struve and his associates, but it all seemedforeign and dry, and beyond the fact that it bore on the litigationover the Anvil Creek mines, she understood nothing and cared less,particularly as a new interest had but recently come into her life, aninterest in the form of a man--McNamara.He had begun with quiet, half-concealed admiration of her, which hadrapidly increased until his attentions had become of a singularlypositive and resistless character.Judge Stillman was openly delighted, while the court of one like AlecMcNamara could but flatter any girl. In his presence, Helen feltherself rebelling at his suit, yet as distance separated them shethought ever more kindly of it. This state of mind contrasted oddlywith her feelings towards the other man she had met, for in thiscountry there were but two. When Glenister was with her she saw hislove lying nakedly in his eyes and it exercised some spell which drewher to him in spite of herself, but when he had gone, back came thedistrust, the terror of the brute she felt was there behind it all. Theone appealed to her while present, the other pled strongest while away.Now she was attempting to analyze her feelings and face the futuresquarely, for she realized that her affairs neared a crisis, and this,too, not a month after meeting the men. She wondered if she would cometo love her uncle's friend. She did not know. Of the other she wassure--she never could.Busied with these reflections, she noticed the familiar figure ofDextry wandering aimlessly. He was not unkempt, and yet his air gaveher the impression of prolonged sleeplessness. Spying her, heapproached and seated himself in the sand against the boat, while ather greeting he broke into talk as if he was needful only of herfriendly presence to stir his confidential chords into active vibration."We're in turrible shape, miss," he said. "Our claim's jumped. Somebodyrun in and talked the boy out of it while I was gone, and now we can'tget 'em off. He's been tryin' this here new law game that you-allbrought in this summer. I've been drunk--that's what makes me look soornery."He said the last, not in the spirit of apology, for rarely does yourfrontiersman consider that his self-indulgences require palliation, butrather after the manner of one purveying news of mild interest, as hewould inform you that his surcingle had broken or that he had witnesseda lynching."What made them jump your claim?""I don't know. I don't know nothin' about it, because, as I remarkedprevious, I 'ain't follered the totterin' footsteps of the law none tooclose. Nor do I intend to. I simply draws out of the game fer a spell,and lets the youngster have his fling; then if he can't make good, I'lltake the cards and finish it for him."It's like the time I was ranchin' with an Englishman up in Montana.This here party claimed the misfortune of bein' a younger son, whateverthat is, and is grubstaked to a ranch by his people back home. Havin'acquired an intimate knowledge of the West by readin' Bret Harte, andhavin' assim'lated the secrets of ranchin' by correspondence school, heis fitted, ample, to teach us natives a thing or two--and he does it. Iam workin' his outfit as foreman, and it don't take long to show methat he's a good-hearted feller, in spite of his ridin'-bloomers an'pinochle eye-glass. He ain't never had no actual experience, but he'sgot a Henry Thompson Seton book that tells him all about everythingfrom field-mice to gorrillys."We're troubled a heap with coyotes them days, and finally this partysends home for some Rooshian wolf-hounds. I'm fer pizenin' a sheepcarcass, but he says:"'No, no, me deah man; that's not sportsman-like; we'll hunt 'em. Ay,hunt 'em! Only fawncy the sport we'll have, ridin' to hounds!'"'We will not,' says I. 'I ain't goin' to do no Simon Legree stunts. Itain't man's size. Bein' English, you don't count, but I'm growed up.'"Nothin' would do him but those Uncle Tom's Cabin dogs, however, and hehad 'em imported clean from Berkshire or Sibeery or thereabouts, fourof 'em, great, big, blue ones. They was as handsome and imposin' as aset of solid-gold teeth, but somehow they didn't seem to savvy our playnone. One day the cook rolled a rain bar'l down-hill from the kitchen,and when them blooded critters saw it comin' they throwed down theirtails and tore out like rabbits. After that I couldn't see no good in'em with a spy-glass."'They 'ain't got no grit. What makes you think they can fight?' Iasked one day."'Fight?' says H'Anglish. 'My deah man, they're full-blooded. Costseventy pun each. They're dreadful creatures when they'reroused--they'll tear a wolf to pieces like a rag--kill bears--anything.Oh! Rully, perfectly dreadful!'"Well, it wasn't a week later that he went over to the east line withme to mend a barb wire. I had my pliers and a hatchet and some staples.About a mile from the house we jumped up a little brown bear thatscampered off when he seen us, but bein' agin' a bluff where hecouldn't get away, he climbed a cotton-wood. H'Anglish was simplyfrothin' with excitement."'What a misfortune! Neyther gun nor hounds.'"'I'll scratch his back and talk pretty to him,' says I, 'while you runback and get a Winchester and them ferocious bull-dogs.'"'Wolf-hounds,' says he, with dignity, 'full-blooded, seventy pun each.They'll rend the poor beast limb from limb. I hate to do it, but it 'llbe good practice for them.'"'They may be good renders,' says I, 'but don't forgit the gun.'"Well, I throwed sticks at the critter when he tried to unclimb thetree, till finally the boss got back with his dogs. They set up anawful holler when they see the bear--first one they'd ever smelled, Ireckon--and the little feller crawled up in some forks and watchedthings, cautious, while they leaped about, bayin' most fierce andblood-curdlin'."'How you goin' to get him down?' says I."'I'll shoot him in the lower jaw,' says the Britisher, 'so he cawn'tbite the dogs. It 'll give 'em cawnfidence.'"He takes aim at Mr. Bear's chin and misses it three times runnin',he's that excited."'Settle down, H'Anglish,' says I. 'He 'ain't got no double chins. Howmany shells left in your gun?'" When he looks he finds there's only onemore, for he hadn't stopped to fill the magazine, so I cautions him."'You're shootin' too low. Raise her.'"He raised her all right, and caught Mr. Bruin in the snout. Whatfollowed thereafter was most too quick to notice, for the poor bear letout a bawl, dropped off his limb into the midst of them ragin',tur'ble, seventy-pun hounds, an' hugged 'em to death, one afteranother, like he was doin' a system of health exercises. He took 'em tohis boosum as if he'd just got back off a long trip, then, droppin' thelast one, he made at that younger son an' put a gold fillin' in hisleg. Yes, sir; most chewed it off. H'Anglish let out a Siberian-wolfholler hisself, an' I had to step in with the hatchet and kill thebrute though I was most dead from laughin'."That's how it is with me an' Glenister," the old man concluded. "Whenhe gets tired experimentin' with this new law game of hisn, I'll stepin an' do business on a common-sense basis.""You talk as if you wouldn't get fair play," said Helen."We won't," said he, with conviction. "I look on all lawyers withsuspicion, even to old bald-face--your uncle, askin' your pardon an'gettin' it, bein' as I'm a friend an' he ain't no real relation ofyours, anyhow. No, sir; they're all crooked."Dextry held the Western distrust of the legalprofession--comprehensive, unreasoning, deep."Is the old man all the kin you've got?" he questioned, when sherefused to discuss the matter."He is--in a way. I have a brother, or I hope I have, somewhere. He ranaway when we were both little tads and I haven't seen him since. Iheard about him, indirectly, at Skagway--three years ago--during thebig rush to the Klondike, but he has never been home. When father died,I went to live with Uncle Arthur--some day, perhaps, I'll find mybrother. He's cruel to hide from me this way, for there are only we twoleft and I've loved him always."She spoke sadly and her mood blended well with the gloom of hercompanion, so they stared silently out over the heaving green waters."It's a good thing me an' the kid had a little piece of money ahead,"Dextry resumed later, reverting to the thought that lay uppermost inhis mind, "'cause we'd be up against it right if we hadn't. The boycouldn't have amused himself none with these court proceedings, becausethey come high. I call 'em luxuries, like brandied peaches an' silkundershirts."I don't trust these Jim Crow banks no more than I do lawyers, neither.No, sirree! I bought a iron safe an' hauled it out to the mine. Sheweighs eighteen hundred, and we keep our money locked up there. We'vegot a feller named Johnson watchin' it now. Steal it? Well, hardly.They can't bust her open without a stick of 'giant' which would rouseeverybody in five miles, an' they can't lug her off bodily--she's tooheavy. No; it's safer there than any place I know of. There ain't noabscondin' cashiers an' all that. Tomorrer I'm goin' back to live onthe claim an' watch this receiver man till the thing's settled."When the girl arose to go, he accompanied her up through the deep sandof the lane-like street to the main, muddy thoroughfare of the camp. Asyet, the planked and gravelled pavements, which later threaded thetown, were unknown, and the incessant traffic had worn the road into aquagmire of chocolate-colored slush, almost axle-deep, with which thestore fronts, show-windows, and awnings were plentifully shot andspattered from passing teams. Whenever a wagon approached, pedestriansfled to the shelter of neighboring doorways, watching a chance to dodgeout again. When vehicles passed from the comparative solidity of themain street out into the morasses that constituted the rest of thetown, they adventured perilously, their horses plunging, snorting,terrified, amid an atmosphere of profanity. Discouraged animals weredown constantly, and no foot-passenger, even with rubber boots,ventured off the planks that led from house to house.To avoid a splashing team, Dextry pulled his companion close in againstthe entrance to the Northern saloon, standing before her protectingly.Although it was late in the afternoon the Bronco Kid had just arisenand was now loafing preparatory to the active duties of his profession.He was speaking with the proprietor when Dextry and the girl soughtshelter just without the open door, so he caught a fair though fleetingglimpse of her as she flashed a curious look inside. She had never beenso close to a gambling-hall before, and would have liked to peer inmore carefully had she dared, but her companion moved forward. At thefirst look the Bronco Kid had broken off in his speech and stared ather as though at an apparition. When she had vanished, he spoke toReilly:"Who's that?"Reilly shrugged his shoulders, then without further question the Kidturned back towards the empty theatre and out of the back door.He moved nonchalantly till he was outside, then with the speed of acolt ran down the narrow planking between the buildings, turnedparallel to the front street, leaped from board to board, splashedthrough puddles of water till he reached the next alley. Stamping themud from his shoes and pulling down his sombrero, he sauntered out intothe main thoroughfare.Dextry and his companion had crossed to the other side and wereapproaching, so the gambler gained a fair view of them. He searchedevery inch of the girl's face and figure, then, as she made to turn hereyes in his direction, he slouched away. He followed, however, at adistance, till he saw the man leave her, then on up to the big hotel heshadowed her. A half-hour later he was drinking in the Golden Gatebar-room with an acquaintance who ministered to the mechanical detailsbehind the hotel counter."Who's the girl I saw come in just now?" he inquired."I guess you mean the Judge's niece."Both men spoke in the dead, restrained tones that go with theircallings."What's her name?""Chester, I think. Why? Look good to you, Kid?"Although the other neither spoke nor made sign, the bartender construedhis silence as acquiescence and continued, with a conscious glance athis own reflection while he adjusted his diamond scarf-pin: "Well, shecan have ME! I've got it fixed to meet her.""BAH! I guess not," said the Kid, suddenly, with an inflection thatstartled the other from his preening. Then, as he went out, the manmused:"Gee! Bronco's got the worst eye in the camp! Makes me creep when hethrows it on me with that muddy look. He acted like he was jealous." At noon the next day, as he prepared to go to the claim, Dextry'spartner burst in upon him. Glenister was dishevelled, and his eyesshone with intense excitement."What d'you think they've done now?" he cried, as greeting."I dunno. What is it?""They've broken open the safe and taken our money.""What!"The old man in turn was on his feet, the grudge which he had feltagainst Glenister in the past few days forgotten in this commonmisfortune."Yes, by Heaven, they've swiped our money--our tents, tools, teams,books, hose, and all of our personal property--everything! They threwJohnson off and took the whole works. I never heard of such a thing. Iwent out to the claim and they wouldn't let me go near the workings.They've got every mine on Anvil Creek guarded the same way, and theyaren't going to let us come around even when they clean up. They toldme so this morning.""But, look here," demanded Dextry, sharply, "the money in that safebelongs to us. That's money we brought in from the States. The court'ain't got no right to it. What kind of a damn law is that?""Oh, as to law, they don't pay any attention to it any more," saidGlenister, bitterly. "I made a mistake in not killing the first manthat set foot on the claim. I was a sucker, and now we're up against astiff game. The Swedes are in the same fix, too. This last order hasleft them groggy." "I don't understand it yet," said Dextry."Why, it's this way. The Judge has issued what he calls an orderenlarging the powers of the receiver, and it authorizes McNamara totake possession of everything on the claims--tents, tools, stores, andpersonal property of all kinds. It was issued last night without noticeto our side, so Wheaton says, and they served it this morning early. Iwent out to see McNamara, and when I got there I found him in ourprivate tent with the safe broken open.""'What does this mean?' I said. And then he showed me the new order."'I'm responsible to the court for every penny of this money,' said he,'and for every tool on the claim. In view of that I can't allow you togo near the workings.'"'Not go near the workings?' said I. 'Do you mean you won't let us seethe clean-ups from our own mine? How do we know we're getting a squaredeal if we don't see the gold weighed?'"'I'm an officer of the court and under bond,' said he, and the smilingtriumph in his eyes made me crazy."'You're a lying thief,' I said, looking at him square. 'And you'regoing too far. You played me for a fool once and made it stick, but itwon't work twice.'"He looked injured and aggrieved and called in Voorhees, the marshal. Ican't grasp the thing at all; everybody seems to be against us, theJudge, the marshal, the prosecuting attorney--everybody. Yet they'vedone it all according to law, they claim, and have the soldiers to backthem up.""It's just as Mexico Mullins said," Dextry stormed; "there's a deal onof some kind. I'm goin' up to the hotel an' call on the Judge myself. I'ain't never seen him nor this McNamara, either. I allus want to look aman straight in the eyes once, then I know what course to foller in mydealings.""You'll find them both," said Glenister, "for McNamara rode into townbehind me."The old prospector proceeded to the Golden Gate Hotel and inquired forJudge Stillman's room. A boy attempted to take his name, but he seizedhim by the scruff of the neck and sat him in his seat, proceedingunannounced to the suite to which he had been directed. Hearing voices,he knocked, and then, without awaiting a summons, walked in.The room was fitted like an office, with desk, table, type-writer, andlaw-books. Other rooms opened from it on both sides. Two men weretalking earnestly--one gray-haired, smooth-shaven, and clerical, theother tall, picturesque, and masterful. With his first glance the minerknew that before him were the two he had come to see, and that inreality he had to deal with but one, the big man who shot at him thelevel glances."We are engaged," said the Judge, "very busily engaged, sir. Will youcall again in half an hour?"Dextry looked him over carefully from head to foot, then turned hisback on him and regarded the other. Neither he nor McNamara spoke, buttheir eyes were busy and each instinctively knew that here was a foe."What do you want?" McNamara inquired, finally."I just dropped in to get acquainted. My name is Dextry--JoeDextry--from everywhere west of the Missouri--an' your name isMcNamara, ain't it? This here, I reckon, is your little Frenchpoodle--eh?" indicating Stillman."What do you mean?" said McNamara, while the Judge murmured indignantly."Just what I say. However, that ain't what I want to talk about. Idon't take no stock in such truck as judges an' lawyers an' orders ofcourt. They ain't intended to be took serious. They're all right forchildren an' Easterners an' non compos mentis people, I s'pose, butI've always been my own judge, jury, an' hangman, an' I aim to continueworkin' my legislatif, executif, an' judicial duties to the end of thestring. You look out! My pardner is young an' seems to like the idee oflettin' somebody else run his business, so I'm goin' to give him reinand let him amuse himself for a while with your dinky little writs an'receiverships. But don't go too far--you can rob the Swedes, 'causeSwedes ain't entitled to have no money, an' some other crook would getit if you didn't, but don't play me an' Glenister fer Scandinavians.It's a mistake. We're white men, an' I'm apt to come romancin' up herewith one of these an' bust you so you won't hold together durin' theceremonies."With his last words he made the slightest shifting movement, only alifting shrug of the shoulder, yet in his palm lay a six-shooter. Hehad slipped it from his trousers band with the ease of long practiceand absolute surety. Judge Stillman gasped and backed against the desk,but McNamara idly swung his leg as he sat sidewise on the table. Hisonly sign of interest was a quickening of the eyes, a fact of whichDextry made mental note."Yes," said the miner, disregarding the alarm of the lawyer, "you canwear this court in your vest-pocket like a Waterbury, if you want to,but if you don't let me alone, I'll uncoil its main-spring. That's all."He replaced his weapon and, turning, walked out the door.CHAPTER IXSLUICE ROBBERS"We must have money," said Glenister a few days later. "When McNamarajumped our safe he put us down and out. There's no use fighting in thiscourt any longer, for the Judge won't let us work the ground ourselves,even if we give bond, and he won't grant an appeal. He says his ordersaren't appealable. We ought to send Wheaton out to 'Frisco and have himtake the case to the higher courts. Maybe he can get a writ ofsupersedeas.""I don't rec'nize the name, but if it's as bad as it sounds it's surehorrible. Ain't there no cure for it?""It simply means that the upper court would take the case away fromthis one.""Well, let's send him out quick. Every day means ten thousand dollarsto us. It 'll take him a month to make the round trip, so I s'pose heought to leave tomorrow on the Roanoke.""Yes, but where's the money to do it with? McNamara has ours. My God!What a mess we're in! What fools we've been, Dex! There's a conspiracyhere. I'm beginning to see it now that it's too late. This man islooting our country under color of law, and figures on gutting all themines before we can throw him off. That's his game. He'll work them ashard and as long as he can, and Heaven only knows what will become ofthe money. He must have big men behind him in order to fix a UnitedStates judge this way. Maybe he has the 'Frisco courts corrupted, too.""If he has, I'm goin' to kill him," said Dextry. "I've worked like adog all my life, and now that I've struck pay I don't aim to lose it.If Bill Wheaton can't win out accordin' to law, I'm goin' to proceedaccordin' to justice."During the past two days the partners had haunted the court-room wheretheir lawyer, together with the counsel for the Scandinavians, hadargued and pleaded, trying every possible professional andunprofessional artifice in search of relief from the arbitrary rulingsof the court, while hourly they had become more strongly suspicious ofsome sinister plot--some hidden, powerful understanding back of theJudge and the entire mechanism of justice. They had fought with thefury of men who battle for life, and had grown to hate the lines ofStillman's vacillating face, the bluster of the district-attorney, andthe smirking confidence of the clerks, for it seemed that they allworked mechanically, like toys, at the dictates of Alec McNamara. Atlast, when they had ceased, beaten and exhausted, they were tooconfused with technical phrases to grasp anything except the fact thatrelief was denied them; that their claims were to be worked by thereceiver; and, as a crowning defeat, they learned that the Judge wouldmove his court to St. Michael's and hear no cases until he returned, amonth later.Meanwhile, McNamara hired every idle man he could lay hand upon, andripped the placers open with double shifts. Every day a stream ofyellow dust poured into the bank and was locked in his vaults, whilethose mine-owners who attempted to witness the clean-ups were ejectedfrom their claims. The politician had worked with incredible swiftnessand system, and a fortnight after landing he had made good his boast toStruve, and was in charge of every good claim in the district, theowners were ousted, their appeals argued and denied, and the court gonefor thirty days, leaving him a clear field for his operations. He felta contempt for most of his victims, who were slow-witted Swedes,grasping neither the purport nor the magnitude of his operation, and asto those litigants who were discerning enough to see its enormity, hetrusted to his organization to thwart them.The two partners had come to feel that they were beating against awall, and had also come squarely to face the proposition that they werewithout funds wherewith to continue their battle. It was maddening forthem to think of the daily robbery that they suffered, for the Midasturned out many ounces of gold at every shift; and more maddening torealize the receiver's shrewdness in crippling them by his theft of thegold in their safe. That had been his crowning stroke."We MUST get money quick," said Glenister. "Do you think we can borrow?""Borrow?" sniffed Dextry. "Folks don't lend money in Alaska."They relapsed into a moody silence."I met a feller this mornin' that's workin' on the Midas," the old manresumed. "He came in town fer a pair of gum boots, an' he says they'verun into awful rich ground--so rich that they have to clean up everymorning when the night shift goes off 'cause the riffles clog withgold.""Think of it!" Glenister growled. "If we had even a part of one ofthose clean-ups we could send Wheaton outside."In the midst of his bitterness a thought struck him. He made as thoughto speak, then closed his mouth; but his partner's eyes were on him,filled with a suppressed but growing fire. Dextry lowered his voicecautiously:"There'll be twenty thousand dollars in them sluices to-night atmidnight."Glenister stared back while his pulse pounded at something that lay inthe other's words."It belongs to us," the young man said. "There wouldn't be anythingwrong about it, would there?"Dextry sneered. "Wrong! Right! Them is fine an' soundin' titles in amess like this. What do they mean? I tell you, at midnight to-nightAlec McNamara will have twenty thousand dollars of our money--""God! What would happen if they caught us?" whispered the younger,following out his thought. "They'd never let us get off the claimalive. He couldn't find a better excuse to shoot us down and get rid ofus. If we came up before this Judge for trial, we'd go to Sitka fortwenty years.""Sure! But it's our only chance. I'd ruther die on the Midas in a fairfight than set here bitin' my hangnails. I'm growin' old and I won'tnever make another strike. As to bein' caught--them's our chances. Iwon't be took alive--I promise you that--and before I go I'll get mysatisfy. Castin' things up, that's about all a man gets in this vale oftears, jest satisfaction of one kind or another. It'll be a fight inthe open, under the stars, with the clean, wet moss to lie down on, andnot a scrappin'-match of freak phrases and law-books inside of astinkin' court-room. The cards is shuffled and in the box, pardner, andthe game is started. If we're due to win, we'll win. If we're due tolose, we'll lose. These things is all figgered out a thousand yearsback. Come on, boy. Are you game?""Am I game?" Glenister's nostrils dilated and his voice rose a tone."Am I game? I'm with you till the big cash-in, and Lord have mercy onany man that blocks our game to-night.""We'll need another hand to help us," said Dextry. "Who can we get?"At that moment, as though in answer, the door opened with the scantceremony that friends of the frontier are wont to observe, admittingthe attenuated, flapping, dome-crowned figure of Slapjack Simms, andDextry fell upon him with the hunger of a wolf. It was midnight and over the dark walls of the valley peered amultitude of stars, while away on the southern horizon there glowed asubdued effulgence as though from hidden fires beneath the Gold God'scaldron, or as though the phosphorescence of Bering had spread upwardinto the skies. Although each night grew longer, it was not yetnecessary to light the men at work in the cuts. There were perhaps twohours in which it was difficult to see at a distance, but the dawn cameearly, hence no provision had been made for torches.Five minutes before the hour the night-shift boss lowered the gates inthe dam, and, as the rush from the sluices subsided, his men quit workand climbed the bluff to the mess tent. The dwellings of the Midas, ashas already been explained, sat back from the creek at a distance of acity block, the workings being thus partially hidden under the brow ofthe steep bank.It is customary to leave a watchman in the pit during the noon andmidnight hours, not only to see that strangers preserve a neutralattitude, but also to watch the waste-gates and water supply. The nightman of the Midas had been warned of his responsibility, and, knowingthat much gold lay in his keeping, was disposed to gaze on thecurious-minded with the sourness of suspicion. Therefore, as a manleading a pack-horse approached out of the gloom of the creek-trail,his eyes were on him from the moment he appeared. The road wound alongthe gravel of the bars and passed in proximity to the flumes. However,the wayfarer paid no attention to them, and the watchman detected anexplanatory weariness in his slow gait."Some prospector getting in from a trip," he thought.The stranger stopped, scratched a match, and, as he undertook to lighthis pipe, the observer caught the mahogany shine of a negro's face. Thematch sputtered out and then came impatient blasphemy as he searchedfor another."Evenin', sah! You-all oblige me with a match?"He addressed the watcher on the bank above, and, without waiting areply, began to climb upward.No smoker on the trail will deny the luxury of a light to the mosthumble, so as the negro gained his level the man reached forth toaccommodate him. Without warning, the black man leaped forward with theferocity of an animal and struck the other a fearful blow. The watchmansank with a faint, startled cry, and the African dragged him out ofsight over the brow of the bank, where he rapidly tied him hand andfoot, stuffing a gag into his mouth. At the same moment two otherfigures rounded the bend below and approached. They were mounted andleading a third saddle-horse, as well as other pack-animals. Reachingthe workings, they dismounted. Then began a strange procedure, for oneman clambered upon the sluices and, with a pick, ripped out theriffles. This was a matter of only a few seconds; then, seizing ashovel, he transferred the concentrates which lay in the bottom of theboxes into canvas sacks which his companion held. As each bag wasfilled, it was tied and dumped into the cut. They treated but fourboxes in this way, leaving the lower two-thirds of the flume untouched,for Anvil Creek gold is coarse and the heart of the clean-up lies whereit is thrown in. Gathering the sacks together, they lashed them uponthe pack-animals, then mounted the second string of sluices and beganas before. Throughout it all they worked with feverish haste and inunbroken silence, every moment flashing quick glances at the figure ofthe lookout who stood on the crest above, half dimmed in the shadow ofa willow clump. Judging by their rapidity and sureness, they wereexpert miners.From the tent came the voices of the night shift at table, and thefaint rattle of dishes, while the canvas walls glowed from the lightswithin like great fire-flies hidden in the grass. The foreman,finishing his meal, appeared at the door of the mess tent, and, pausingto accustom his eyes to the gloom, peered perfunctorily towards thecreek. The watchman detached himself from the shadow, moving out intoplain sight, and the boss turned back. The two men below were nowworking on the sluices which lay close under the bank and were thushidden from the tent. McNamara's description of Anvil Creek's riches had fired HelenChester with the desire to witness a clean-up, so they had ridden outfrom town in time for supper at the claim. She had not known whither heled her, only understanding that provision for her entertainment wouldbe made with the superintendent's wife. Upon recognizing the Midas, shehad endeavored to question him as to why her friends had beendispossessed, and he had answered, as it seemed, straight and true.The ground was in dispute, he said--another man claimed it--and whilethe litigation pended he was in charge for the court, to see thatneither party received injury. He spoke adroitly, and it satisfied herto have the proposition resolved into such simplicity.She had come prepared to spend the night and witness the early morningoperation, so the receiver made the most of his opportunity. He showedher over the workings, explaining the many things that were strange toher. Not only was he in himself a fascinating figure to any woman, butwherever he went men regarded him deferentially, and nothing affects awoman's judgment more promptly than this obvious sign of power. Hespent the evening with her, talking of his early days and the things hehad done in the West, his story matching the picturesqueness of hercanvas-walled quarters with their rough furnishings of skins andblankets. Being a keen observer as well as a finished raconteur, he hadwoven a spell of words about the girl, leaving her in a state of tumultand indecision when at last, towards midnight, he retired to his owntent. She knew to what end all this was working, and yet knew not whather answer would be when the question came which lay behind it all. Atmoments she felt the wonderful attraction of the man, and still therewas some distrust of him which she could not fathom. Again her thoughtsreverted to Glenister, the impetuous, and she compared the two, sosimilar in some ways, so utterly opposed in others.It was when she heard the night shift at their meal that she threw asilken shawl about her head, stepped into the cool night, and pickedher way down towards the roar of the creek. "A breath of air and thento bed," she thought. She saw the tall figure of the watchman and madefor him. He seemed oddly interested in her approach, watching her veryclosely, almost as though alarmed. It was doubtless because there wereso few women out here, or possibly on account of the lateness of thehour. Away with conventions! This was the land of instinct and impulse.She would talk to him. The man drew his hat more closely about his faceand moved off as she came up. Glenister had been in her thoughts amoment since, and she now noted that here was another with the samegreat, square shoulders and erect head. Then she saw with a start thatthis one was a negro. He carried a Winchester and seemed to watch hercarefully, yet with indecision.To express her interest and to break the silence, she questioned him,but at the sound of her voice he stepped towards her and spoke roughly."What!"Then he paused, and stammered in a strangely altered and unnaturalvoice:"Yass'm. I'm the watchman."She noted two other darkies at work below and was vaguely surprised,not so much at their presence, as at the manner in which they moved,for they seemed under stress of some great haste, running hither andyon. She saw horses standing in the trail and sensed somethingindefinably odd and alarming in the air. Turning to the man, she openedher mouth to speak, when from the rank grass under her feet came anoise which set her a-tingle, and at which her suspicions leaped fullto the solution. It was the groan of a man. Again he gave voice to hispain, and she knew that she stood face to face with something sinister.Tales of sluice robbers had come to her, and rumors of the daring raidsinto which men were lured by the yellow sheen--and yet this wasincredible. A hundred men lay within sound of her voice; she could heartheir laughter; one was whistling a popular refrain. A quarter-mileaway on every hand were other camps; a scream from her would bring themall. Nonsense, this was no sluice robbery--and then the man in thebushes below moaned for the third time."What is that?" she said.Without reply the negro lowered the muzzle of his rifle till it coveredher breast and at the same time she heard the double click of thehammer."Keep still and don't move," he warned. "We're desperate and we can'ttake any chances, Miss.""Oh, you are stealing the gold--"She was wildly frightened, yet stood still while the lookout anxiouslydivided his attention between her and the tents above until hiscompanions signalled him that they were through and the horses wereloaded. Then he spoke:"I don't know what to do with you, but I guess I'll tie you up.""What!" she said."I'm going to tie and gag you so you can't holler.""Oh, don't you DARE!" she cried, fiercely. "I'll stand right here tillyou've gone and I won't scream. I promise." She looked up at himappealingly, at which he dipped his head, so that she caught only aglimpse of his face, and then backed away."All right! Don't try it, because I'll be hidden in those bushes yonderat the bend and I'll keep you covered till the others are gone." Heleaped down the bank, ran to the cavalcade, mounted quickly, and thethree lashed their horses into a run, disappearing up the trail aroundthe sharp curve. She heard the blows of their quirts as they whippedthe pack-horses.They were long out of sight before the girl moved or made sound,although she knew that none of the three had paused at the bend. Sheonly stood and gazed, for as they galloped off she had heard the scrapof a broken sentence. It was but one excited word, sounding through therattle of hoofs--her own name--"Helen"; and yet because of it she didnot voice the alarm, but rather began to piece together, bit by bit,the strange points of this adventure. She recalled the outlines of hercaptor with a wrinkle of perplexity. Her fright disappeared entirely,giving place to intense excitement. "No, no--it can't be--and yet Iwonder if it IS!" she cried. "Oh, I wonder if it could be!" She openedher lips to cry aloud, then hesitated. She started towards the tents,then paused, and for many moments after the hoof-beats had died out shestayed undecided. Surely she wished to give the signal, to force thefierce pursuit. What meant this robbery, this defiance of the law, ofher uncle's edicts and of McNamara? They were common thieves,criminals, outlaws, these men, deserving punishment, and yet sherecalled a darker night, when she herself had sobbed and quivered withthe terrors of pursuit and two men had shielded her with their bodies.She turned and sped towards the tents, bursting in through the canvasdoor; instantly every man rose to his feet at sight of her pallid face,her flashing eyes, and rumpled hair."Sluice robbers!" she cried, breathlessly. "Quick! A hold-up! Thewatchman is hurt!"A roar shook the night air, and the men poured out past her, while theday shift came tumbling forth from every quarter in various stages ofundress."Where? Who did it? Where did they go?"McNamara appeared among them, fierce and commanding, seeming to graspthe situation intuitively, without explanation from her."Come on, men. We'll run 'em down. Get out the horses. Quick!"He was mounted even as he spoke, and others joined him. Then turning,he waved his long arm up the valley towards the mountains. "Divide intosquads of five and cover the hills! Run down to Discovery, one of you,and telephone to town for Voorhees and a posse."As they made ready to ride away, the girl cried:"Stop! Not that way. They went DOWN the gulch--three negroes."She pointed out of the valley, towards the dim glow on the southernhorizon, and the cavalcade rode away into the gloom.CHAPTER XTHE WIT OF AN ADVENTURESSUp creek the three negroes fled, past other camps, to where the streambranched. Here they took to the right and urged their horses along aforsaken trail to the head-waters of the little tributary and over thelow saddle. They had endeavored to reach unfrequented paths as soon aspossible in order that they might pass unnoticed. Before quitting thevalley they halted their heaving horses, and, selecting a stagnantpool, scoured the grease paint from their features as best they could.Their ears were strained for sounds of pursuit, but, as the momentspassed and none came, the tension eased somewhat and they conversedguardedly. As the morning light spread they crossed the moss-cappedsummit of the range, but paused again, and, removing two saddles, hidthem among the rocks. Slapjack left the others here and rode southwarddown the Dry Creek Trail towards town, while the partners shifted partof the weight from the overloaded pack-mules to the remainingsaddle-animals and continued eastward along the barren comb of hills onfoot, leading the five horses."It don't seem like we'll get away this easy," said Dextry, scanningthe back trail. "If we do, I'll be tempted to foller the businessreg'lar. This grease paint on my face makes me smell like a minstrelman. I bet we'll get some bully press notices to-morrow.""I wonder what Helen was doing there," Glenister answered,irrelevantly, for he had been more shaken by his encounter with herthan at his part in the rest or the enterprise, and his mind, whichshould have been busied with the flight, held nothing but pictures ofher as she stood in the half darkness under the fear of his Winchester."What if she ever learned who that black ruffian was!" He quailed atthe thought."Say, Dex, I am going to marry that girl.""I dunno if you be or not," said Dextry. "Better watch McNamara.""What!" The younger man stopped and stared. "What do you mean?""Go on. Don't stop the horses. I ain't blind. I kin put two an' twotogether.""You'll never put those two together. Nonsense! Why, the man's arascal. I wouldn't let him have her. Besides, it couldn't be. She'llfind him out. I love her so much that--oh, my feelings are too big totalk about." He moved his hands eloquently. "You can't understand.""Um-m! I s'pose not," grunted Dextry, but his eyes were level and heldthe light of the past."He may be a rascal," the old man continued, after a little; "I'll putin with you on that; but he's a handsome devil, and, as for manners, hemakes you look like a logger. He's a brave man, too. Them threequalities are trump-cards and warranted to take most any queen in thehuman deck--red, white, or yellow.""If he dares," growled Glenister, while his thick brows came forwardand ugly lines hardened in his face.In the gray of the early morning they descended the foot-hills into thewide valley of the Nome River and filed out across the rolling countryto the river bluffs where, cleverly concealed among the willows, was arocker. This they set up, then proceeded to wash the dirt from thesacks carefully, yet with the utmost speed, for there was seriousdanger of discovery. It was wonderful, this treasure of the richestground since the days of '49, and the men worked with shining eyes andhands a-tremble. The gold was coarse, and many ragged, yellow lumps,too large to pass through the screen, rolled in the hopper, while theaprons bellied with its weight. In the pans which they had providedthere grew a gleaming heap of wet, raw gold.Shortly, by divergent routes, the partners rode unnoticed into town,and into the excitement of the hold-up news, while the tardy stilllingered over their breakfasts. Far out in the roadstead lay theRoanoke, black smoke pouring from her stack. A tug was returning fromits last trip to her.Glenister forced his lathered horse down to the beach and questionedthe longshoremen who hung about."No; it's too late to get aboard--the last tender is on its way back,"they informed him. "If you want to go to the 'outside' you'll have towait for the fleet. That only means another week, and--there she blowsnow."A ribbon of white mingled with the velvet from the steamer's funnel andthere came a slow, throbbing, farewell blast.Glenister's jaw clicked and squared."Quick! You men!" he cried to the sailors. "I want the lightest dory onthe beach and the strongest oarsmen in the crowd. I'll be back in fiveminutes. There's a hundred dollars in it for you if we catch that ship."He whirled and spurred up through the mud of the streets. Bill Wheatonwas snoring luxuriously when wrenched from his bed by a dishevelled manwho shook him into wakefulness and into a portion of his clothes, witha storm of excited instructions. The lawyer had neither time noropportunity for expostulation, for Glenister snatched a valise andswept into it a litter of documents from the table."Hurry up, man," he yelled, as the lawyer dived frantically about hisoffice in a rabbit-like hunt for items. "My Heavens! Are you dead? Wakeup! The ship's leaving." With sleep still in his eyes Wheaton wasdragged down the street to the beach, where a knot had assembled towitness the race. As they tumbled into the skiff, willing hands ran itout into the surf on the crest of a roller. A few lifting heaves andthey were over the bar with the men at the oars bending the white ashat every swing."I guess I didn't forget anything," gasped Wheaton as he put on hiscoat. "I got ready yesterday, but I couldn't find you last night, so Ithought the deal was off."Glenister stripped off his coat and, facing the bow, pushed upon theoars at every stroke, thus adding his strength to that of the oarsmen.They crept rapidly out from the beach, eating up the two miles that laytowards the ship. He urged the men with all his power till the sweatsoaked through their clothes and, under their clinging shirts, themuscles stood out like iron. They had covered half the distance whenWheaton uttered a cry and Glenister desisted from his work with acurse. The Roanoke was moving slowly.The rowers rested, but the young man shouted at them to begin again,and, seizing a boat-hook, stuck it into the arms of his coat. He wavedthis on high while the men redoubled their efforts. For many momentsthey hung in suspense, watching the black hull as it gathered speed,and then, as they were about to cease their effort, a puff of steamburst from its whistle and the next moment a short toot of recognitionreached them. Glenister wiped the moisture from his brow and grinned atWheaton.A quarter of an hour later, as they lay heaving below the ship's steelsides, he thrust a heavy buckskin sack into the lawyer's hand."There's money to win the fight, Bill. I don't know how much, but it'senough. God bless you. Hurry back!"A sailor cast them a whirling rope, up which Wheaton clambered; then,tying the gripsack to its end, they sent it after."Important!" the young man yelled at the officer on the bridge."Government business." He heard a muffled clang in the engine-room, thethrash of the propellers followed, and the big ship glided past.As Glenister dragged himself up the beach, upon landing, Helen Chestercalled to him, and made room for him beside her. It had never beennecessary to call him to her side before; and equally unfamiliar wasthe abashment, or perhaps physical weariness, that led the young man tosink back in the warm sand with a sigh of relief. She noted that, forthe first time, the audacity was gone from his eyes."I watched your race," she began. "It was very exciting and I cheeredfor you."He smiled quietly."What made you keep on after the ship started? I should have givenup--and cried.""I never give up anything that I want," he said."Have you never been forced to? Then it is because you are a man. Womenhave to sacrifice a great deal."Helen expected him to continue to the effect that he would never giveher up--it was in accordance with his earlier presumption--but he wassilent; and she was not sure that she liked him as well thus as when heoverwhelmed her with the boldness of his suit. For Glenister it wasdelightful, after the perils of the night, to rest in the calm of herpresence and to feel dumbly that she was near. She saw him secretlycaress a fold of her dress.If only she had not the memory of that one night on the ship. "Still,he is trying to make amends in the best way he can," she thought."Though, of course, no woman could care for a man who would do such athing." Yet she thrilled at the thought of how he had thrust his bodybetween her and danger; how, but for his quick, insistent action, shewould have failed in escaping from the pest ship, failed in hermission, and met death on the night of her landing. She owed him much."Did you hear what happened to the good ship Ohio?" she asked."No; I've been too busy to inquire. I was told the health officersquarantined her when she arrived, that's all.""She was sent to Egg Island with every one aboard. She has been theremore than a month now and may not get away this summer.""What a disappointment for the poor devils on her!""Yes, and only for what you did, I should be one of them," Helenremarked."I didn't do much," he said. "The fighting part is easy. It's not halfso hard as to give up your property and lie still while--""Did you do that because I asked you to--because I asked you to putaside the old ways?" A wave of compassion swept over her."Certainly," he answered. "It didn't come easy, but--""Oh, I thank you," said she. "I know it is all for the best. UncleArthur wouldn't do anything wrong, and Mr. McNamara is an honorableman."He turned towards her to speak, but refrained. He could not tell herwhat he felt certain of. She believed in her own blood and in heruncle's friends--and it was not for him to speak of McNamara. The rulesof the game sealed his lips.She was thinking again, "If only you had not acted as you did." Shelonged to help him now in his trouble as he had helped her, but whatcould she do? The law was such a confusing, intricate, perplexing thing."I spent last night at the Midas," she told him, "and rode back earlythis morning. That was a daring hold-up, wasn't it?""What hold-up?""Why, haven't you heard the news?""No" he answered, steadily. "I just got up.""Your claim was robbed. Three men overcame the watchman at midnight andcleaned the boxes."His simulation of excited astonishment was perfect and he rained ashower of questions upon her. She noted with approval that he did notlook her in the eye, however. He was not an accomplished liar. NowMcNamara had a countenance of iron. Unconsciously she made comparison,and the young man at her side did not lose thereby."Yes, I saw it all," she concluded, after recounting the details. "Thenegro wanted to bind me so that I couldn't give the alarm, but hischivalry prevented. He was a most gallant darky.""What did you do when they left?""Why, I kept my word and waited until they were out of sight, then Iroused the camp, and set Mr. McNamara and his men right after them downthe gulch.""DOWN the gulch!" spoke Glenister, off his guard."Yes, of course. Did you think they went UP-stream?" She was lookingsquarely at him now, and he dropped his eyes. "No, the posse started inthat direction, but I put them right." There was an odd light in herglance, and he felt the blood drumming in his ears.She sent them down-stream! So that was why there had been no pursuit!Then she must suspect--she must know everything! Glenister was stunned.Again his love for the girl surged tumultuously within him and demandedexpression. But Miss Chester, no longer feeling sure that she had thesituation in hand, had already started to return to the hotel. "I sawthe men distinctly," she told him, before they separated, "and I couldidentify them all."At his own house Glenister found Dextry removing the stains of thenight's adventure."Miss Chester recognized us last night," he announced."How do you know?""She told me so just now, and, what's more, she sent McNamara and hiscrowd down the creek instead of up. That's why we got away so easily.""Well, well--ain't she a brick? She's even with us now. By-the-way, Iwonder how much we cleaned up, anyhow--let's weigh it." Going to thebed, Dextry turned back the blankets, exposing four moose-skin sacks,wet and heavy, where he had thrown them."There must have been twenty thousand dollars with what I gaveWheaton," said Glenister.At that moment, without warning, the door was flung open, and as theyoung man jerked the blankets into place he whirled, snatched thesix-shooter that Dextry had discarded, and covered the entrance."Don't shoot, boy!" cried the new-comer, breathlessly. "My, but you'renervous!"Glenister dropped his gun. It was Cherry Malotte; and, from her heavingbreast and the flying colors in her cheeks, the men saw she had beenrunning. She did not give them time to question, but closed and lockedthe door while the words came tumbling from her:"They're on to you, boys--you'd better duck out quick. They're on theirway up here now.""What!""Who?""Quick! I heard McNamara and Voorhees, the marshal, talking. Somebodyhas spotted you for the hold-ups. They're on their way now, I tell you.I sneaked out by the back way and came here through the mud. Say, butI'm a sight!" She stamped her trimly booted feet and flirted her skirt."I don't savvy what you mean," said Dextry, glancing at his partnerwarningly. "We ain't done nothin'.""Well, it's all right then. I took a long chance so you could make aget-away if you wanted to, because they've got warrants for you forthat sluice robbery last night. Here they are now." She darted to thewindow, the men peering over her shoulder. Coming up the narrow walkthey saw Voorhees, McNamara, and three others.The house stood somewhat isolated and well back on the tundra, so thatany one approaching it by the planking had an unobstructed view of thepremises. Escape was impossible, for the back door led out into theankle-deep puddles of the open prairie; and it was now apparent that asixth man had made a circuit and was approaching from the rear."My God! They'll search the place," said Dextry, and the men lookedgrimly in each other's faces.Then in a flash Glenister stripped back the blankets and seized the"pokes," leaping into the back room. In another instant he returnedwith them and faced desperately the candid bareness of the little roomthat they lived and slept in. Nothing could be hidden; it was folly tothink of it. There was a loft overhead, he remembered, hopefully, thenrealized that the pursuers would search there first of all."I told you he was a hard fighter," said Dextry, as the quick footstepsgrew louder. "He ain't no fool neither. 'Stead of our bein' caught inthe mountains, I reckon we'll shoot it out here. We should have cachedthat gold somewhere."He spun the cylinder of his blackened Colt, while his face grew hardand vulture-like.Meanwhile, Cherry Malotte watched the hunted look in Glenister's facegrow wilder and then stiffen into the stubbornness of a man at bay. Theposse was at the door now, knocking. The three inside stood rigid andstrained. Then Glenister tossed his burden on the bed."Go into the back room, Cherry; there's going to be trouble.""Who's there?" inquired Dextry through the door, to gain time.Suddenly, without a word, the girl glided to the hot-blast heater, nowcold and empty, which stood in a corner of the room. These stoves, usedwidely in the North, are vertical iron cylinders into which coal ispoured from above. She lifted the lid and peered in to find it aquarter full of dead ashes, then turned with shining eyes and partedlips to Glenister. He caught the hint, and in an instant the four sackswere dropped softly into the feathery bottom and the ashes raked over.The daring manoeuvre was almost as quick as the flash of woman's witthat prompted it, and was carried through while the answer to Dextry'squestion was still unspoken.Then Glenister opened the door carelessly and admitted the group of men."We've got a search-warrant to look through your house," said Voorhees."What are you looking for?""Gold-dust from Anvil Creek.""All right--search away."They rapidly scoured the premises, covering every inch, paying no heedto the girl, who watched them with indifferent eyes, nor to the oldman, who glared at their every movement. Glenister was carelesslysarcastic, although he kept his right arm free, while beneath hissang-froid was a thoroughly trained alertness.McNamara directed the search with a manner wholly lacking in his formermock courtesy. It was as though he had been soured by the gall ofdefeat. The mask had fallen off now, and his charactershowed--insistent, overbearing, cruel. Towards the partners hepreserved a contemptuous silence.The invaders ransacked thoroughly, while a dozen times the hearts ofCherry Malotte and her two companions stopped, then lunged onward, asMcNamara or Voorhees approached, then passed the stove. At lastVoorhees lifted the lid and peered into its dark interior. At the sameinstant the girl cried out, sharply, flinging herself from herposition, while the marshal jerked his head back in time to see herdash upon Dextry."Don't! Don't!" She cried her appeal to the old man. "Keep cool. You'llbe sorry, Dex--they're almost through."The officer had not seen any movement on Dextry's part, but doubtlessher quick eye had detected signs of violence. McNamara emerged,glowering, from the back room at that moment."Let them hunt," the girl was saying, while Dextry stared dazedly overher head. "They won't find anything. Keep cool and don't act rash."Voorhees's duties sat uncomfortably upon him at the best, and, lookingat the smouldering eyes of the two men, he became averse to furthersearch in a powdery household whose members itched to shoot him in theback."It isn't here," he reported; but the politician only scowled, thenspoke for the first time directly to the partners:"I've got warrants for both of you and I'm tempted to take you in, butI won't. I'm not through yet--not by any means. I'll get you--get youboth." He turned out of the door, followed by the marshal, who calledoff his guards, and the group filed back along the walk."Say, you're a jewel, Cherry. You've saved us twice. You caughtVoorhees just in time. My heart hit my palate when he looked into thatstove, but the next instant I wanted to laugh at Dextry's expression."Impulsively Glenister laid his hands upon her shoulders. At his lookand touch her throat swelled, her bosom heaved, and the silken lidsfluttered until she seemed choked by a very flood of sweet womanliness.She blushed like a little maid and laughed a timid, broken laugh; thenpulling herself together, the merry, careless tone came into her voiceand her cheeks grew cool and clear."You wouldn't trust me at first, eh? Some day you'll find that your oldfriends are the best, after all."And as she left them she added, mockingly:"Say, you're a pair of 'shine' desperadoes. You need a governess."CHAPTER XIWHEREIN A WRIT AND A RIOT FAILA Raw, gray day with a driving drizzle from seaward and a leaden rackof clouds drifting low matched the sullen, fitful mood of Glenister.During the last month he had chafed and fretted like an animal in leashfor word of Wheaton. This uncertainty, this impotent waiting withfolded hands, was maddening to one of his spirit. He could applyhimself to no fixed duty, for the sense of his wrong preyed on himfiercely, and he found himself haunting the vicinity of the Midas,gazing at it from afar, grasping hungrily for such scraps of news aschanced to reach him. McNamara allowed access to none but his minions,so the partners knew but vaguely of what happened on their property,even though, under fiction of law, it was being worked for theirprotection.No steps regarding a speedy hearing of the case were allowed, and thecollusion between Judge Stillman and the receiver had become sogenerally recognized that there were uneasy mutterings and threats inmany quarters. Yet, although the politician had by now virtuallyabsorbed all the richest properties in the district and worked themthrough his hirelings, the people of Nome as a whole did not grasp thefull turpitude of the scheme nor the system's perfect working.Strange to say, Dextry, the fire-eater, had assumed an Orientalpatience quite foreign to his peppery disposition, and spent much ofhis time in the hills prospecting.On this day, as the clouds broke, about noon, close down on the angryhorizon a drift of smoke appeared, shortly resolving itself into asteamer. She lay to in the offing, and through his glasses Glenistersaw that it was the Roanoke. As the hours passed and no boat put off,he tried to hire a crew, but the longshoremen spat wisely and shooktheir heads as they watched the surf."There's the devil of an undertow settin' along this beach," they toldhim, "and the water's too cold to drownd in comfortable." So he laidfirm hands upon his impatience.Every day meant many dollars to the watcher, and yet it seemed thatnature was resolute in thwarting him, for that night the wind freshenedand daylight saw the ship hugging the lee of Sledge Island, miles tothe westward, while the surf, white as boiling milk, boomed andthundered against the shore.Word had gone through the street that Bill Wheaton was aboard with awrit, or a subpoena, or an alibi, or whatever was necessary to put the"kibosh" on McNamara, so public excitement grew. McNamara hoarded hisgold in the Alaska Bank, and it was taken for granted that there wouldlie the scene of the struggle. No one supposed for an instant that theusurper would part with the treasure peaceably.On the third morning the ship lay abreast of the town again and alife-boat was seen to make off from her, whereupon the idle populationstreamed towards the beach."She'll make it to the surf all right, but then watch out.""We'd better make ready to haul 'em out," said another. "It's mightydangerous." And sure enough, as the skiff came rushing in through thebreakers she was caught.She had made it past the first line, soaring over the bar on a foamyroller-crest like a storm-driven gull winging in towards the land. Thewiry figure of Bill Wheaton crouched in the stern while two sailorsfought with their oars. As they gathered for their rush through thelast zone of froth, a great comber rose out of the sea behind them,rearing high above their heads. The crowd at the surf's edge shouted.The boat wavered, sucked back into the ocean's angry maw, and with acrash the deluge engulfed them. There remained nothing but a swirlingflood through which the life-boat emerged bottom up, amid a tangle ofoars, gratings, and gear.Men rushed into the water, and the next roller pounded them back uponthe marble-hard sand. There came the sound of splitting wood, and thena group swarmed in waist-deep and bore out a dripping figure. It was ahempen-headed seaman, who shook the water from his mane and grinnedwhen his breath had come.A step farther down the beach the by-standers seized a limp form whichthe tide rolled to them. It was the second sailor, his scalp split froma blow of the gunwale. Nowhere was Wheaton.Glenister had plunged to the rescue first, a heaving-line about hismiddle, and although buffeted about he had reached the wreck, only tomiss sight of the lawyer utterly. He had time for but a glance when hewas drawn outward by the undertow till the line at his waist grew taut,then the water surged over him and he was hurled high up on the beachagain. He staggered dizzily back to the struggle, when suddenly a wavelifted the capsized cutter and righted it, and out from beneath shotthe form of Wheaton, grimly clutching the life-ropes. They brought himin choking and breathless."I got it," he said, slapping his streaming breast. "It's all right,Glenister, I knew what delay meant so I took a long chance with thesurf." The terrific ordeal he had undergone had blanched him to thelips, his legs wabbled uncertainly, and he would have fallen but forthe young man, who thrust an arm about his waist and led him up intothe town."I went before the Circuit Court of Appeals in 'Frisco," he explainedlater, "and they issued orders allowing an appeal from this court andgave me a writ of supersedeas directed against old Judge Stillman. Thattakes the litigation out of his hands altogether, and directs McNamarato turn over the Midas and all the gold he's got. What do you think ofthat? I did better than I expected."Glenister wrung his hand silently while a great satisfaction came uponhim. At last this waiting was over and his peaceful yielding toinjustice had borne fruit; had proven the better course after all, asthe girl had prophesied. He could go to her now with clean hands. Themine was his again. He would lay it at her feet, telling her once moreof his love and the change it was working in him. He would make her seeit, make her see that beneath the harshness his years in the wild hadgiven him, his love for her was gentle and true and all absorbing. Hewould bid her be patient till she saw he had mastered himself, till hecould come with his soul in harness."I am glad I didn't fight when they jumped us," he said. "Now we'll getour property back and all the money they took out--that is, if McNamarahasn't salted it.""Yes; all that's necessary is to file the documents, then serve theJudge and McNamara. You'll be back on Anvil Creek to-morrow."Having placed their documents on record at the court-house, the two mencontinued to McNamara's office. He met them with courtesy."I heard you had a narrow escape this morning, Mr. Wheaton. Too bad!What can I do for you?"The lawyer rapidly outlined his position and stated in conclusion:"I filed certified copies of these orders with the clerk of the courtten minutes ago, and now I make formal demand upon you to turn over theMidas to Messrs. Glenister and Dextry, and also to return all thegold-dust in your safe-deposit boxes in accordance with this writ." Hehanded his documents to McNamara, who tossed them on his desk withoutexamination."Well," said the politician, quietly, "I won't do it."Had he been slapped in the face the attorney would not have been moreastonished."Why--you--""I won't do it, I said," McNamara repeated, sharply. "Don't think for aminute that I haven't gone into this fight armed for everything. Writsof supersedeas! Bah!" He snapped his fingers."We'll see whether you'll obey or not," said Wheaton and when he andGlenister were outside he continued:"Let's get to the Judge quick."As they neared the Golden Gate Hotel they spied McNamara entering. Itwas evident that he had slipped from the rear door of his office andbeaten them to the judicial ear."I don't like that," said Glenister. "He's up to something."So it appeared, for they were fifteen minutes in gaining access to themagistrate and then found McNamara with him. Both men were astounded atthe change in Stillman's appearance. During the last month his weakface had shrunk and altered until vacillation was betrayed in everyline, and he had acquired the habit of furtively watching McNamara'sslightest movement. It seemed that the part he played sat heavily uponhim.The Judge examined the papers perfunctorily, and, although his air wasdeliberate, his fingers made clumsy work of it. At last he said:"I regret that I am forced to doubt the authenticity of thesedocuments.""My Heavens, man!" Wheaton cried. "They're certified copies of ordersfrom your superior court. They grant the appeal that you have denied usand take the case out of your hands altogether. Yes--and they orderthis man to surrender the mine and everything connected with it. Now,sir, we want you to enforce these orders."Stillman glanced at the silent man in the window and replied:"You will, of course, proceed regularly and make application in courtin the proper way, but I tell you now that I won't do anything in thematter."Wheaton stared at him fixedly until the old man snapped out:"You say they are certified copies. How do I know they are? Thesignatures may all be false. Maybe you signed them yourself."The lawyer grew very white at this and stammered until Glenister drewhim out of the room."Come, come," he said, "we'll carry this thing through in open court.Maybe his nerve will go back on him then. McNamara has him hypnotized,but he won't dare refuse to obey the orders of the Circuit Court ofAppeals.""He won't, eh? Well, what do you think he's doing right now?" saidWheaton. "I must think. This is the boldest game I ever played in. Theytold me things while I was in 'Frisco which I couldn't believe, but Iguess they're true. Judges don't disobey the orders of their courts ofappeal unless there is power back of them."They proceeded to the attorney's office, but had not been there longbefore Slapjack Simms burst in upon them."Hell to pay!" he panted. "McNamara's taking your dust out of the bank.""What's that?" they cried."I goes into the bank just now for an assay on some quartz samples. Theassayer is busy, and I walk back into his room, and while I'm there introts McNamara in a hurry. He don't see me, as I'm inside the privateoffice, and I overhear him tell them to get his dust out of the vaultquick.""We've got to stop that," said Glenister. "If he takes ours, he'll takethe Swedes', too. Simms, you run up to the Pioneer Company and tellthem about it. If he gets that gold out of there, nobody knows what'llbecome of it. Come on, Bill."He snatched his hat and ran out of the room, followed by the others.That the loose-jointed Slapjack did his work with expedition wasevidenced by the fact that the Swedes were close upon their heels asthe two entered the bank. Others had followed, sensing somethingunusual, and the space within the doors filled rapidly. At thedisturbance the clerks suspended their work, the barred doors of thesafe-deposit vault clanged to, and the cashier laid hand upon the navyColt's at his elbow. "What's the matter?" he cried."We want Alec McNamara," said Glenister.The manager of the bank appeared, and Glenister spoke to him throughthe heavy wire netting."Is McNamara in there?"No one had ever known Morehouse to lie. "Yes, sir." He spokehesitatingly, in a voice full of the slow music of Virginia. "He is inhere. What of it?""We hear he's trying to move that dust of ours and we won't stand forit. Tell him to come out and not hide in there like a dog."At these words the politician appeared beside the Southerner, and thetwo conversed softly an instant, while the impatience of the crowd grewto anger. Some one cried:"Let's go in and drag him out," and the rumble at this was notpleasant. Morehouse raised his hand."Gentlemen, Mr. McNamara says he doesn't intend to take any of the goldaway.""Then he's taken it already.""No, he hasn't."The receiver's course had been quickly chosen at the interruption. Itwas not wise to anger these men too much. Although he had planned toget the money into his own possession, he now thought it best to leaveit here for the present. He could come back at any time when they wereoff guard and get it. Beyond the door against which he stood lay threehundred thousand dollars--weighed, sacked, sealed, and ready to moveout of the custody of this Virginian whose confidence he had tried sofruitlessly to gain.As McNamara looked into the angry eyes of the lean-faced men beyond thegrating, he felt that the game was growing close, and his blood tingledat the thought. He had not planned on a resistance so strong and swift,but he would meet it. He knew that they hungered for his destructionand that Glenister was their leader. He saw further that the man'shatred now stared at him openly for the first time. He knew that backof it was something more than love for the dull metal over which theywrangled, and then a thought came to him."Some of your work, eh, Glenister?" he mocked. "Were you afraid to comealone, or did you wait till you saw me with a lady?"At the same instant he opened a door behind him, revealing HelenChester. "You'd better not walk out with me, Miss Chester. This manmight--well, you're safer here, you know. You'll pardon me for leavingyou." He hoped he could incite the young man to some rash act or wordin the presence of the girl, and counted on the conspicuous heroism ofhis own position, facing the mob single-handed, one against fifty."Come out," said his enemy, hoarsely, upon whom the insult and thesight of the girl in the receiver's company had acted powerfully."Of course I'll come out, but I don't want this young lady to sufferany violence from your friends," said McNamara. "I am not armed, but Ihave the right to leave here unmolested--the right of an Americancitizen." With that he raised his arms above his head. "Out of my way!"he cried. Morehouse opened the gate, and McNamara strode through themob.It is a peculiar thing that although under fury of passion a man mayfire even upon the back of a defenceless foe, yet no one can offerviolence to a man whose arms are raised on high and in whose glance isthe level light of fearlessness. Moreover, it is safer to face a crowdthus than a single adversary.McNamara had seen this psychological trick tried before and now tookadvantage of it to walk through the press slowly, eye to eye. He did ittheatrically, for the benefit of the girl, and, as he foresaw, the menfell away before him--all but Glenister, who blocked him, gun in hand.It was plain that the persecuted miner was beside himself with passion.McNamara came within an arm's-length before pausing. Then he stoppedand the two stared malignantly at each other, while the girl behind therailing heard her heart pounding in the stillness. Glenister raised hishand uncertainly, then let it fall. He shook his head, and steppedaside so that the other brushed past and out into the street.Wheaton addressed the banker:"Mr. Morehouse, we've got orders and writs of one kind or another fromthe Circuit Court of Appeals at 'Frisco directing that this money beturned over to us." He shoved the papers towards the other. "We're notin a mood to trifle. That gold belongs to us, and we want it."Morehouse looked carefully at the papers."I can't help you," he said. "These documents are not directed to me.They're issued to Mr. McNamara and Judge Stillman. If the Circuit Courtof Appeals commands me to deliver it to you I'll do it, but otherwiseI'll have to keep this dust here till it's drawn out by order of thecourt that gave it to me. That's the way it was put in here, and that'sthe way it'll be taken out.""We want it now.""Well, I can't let my sympathies influence me""Then we'll take it out, anyway," cried Glenister. "We've had the worstof it everywhere else and we're sick of it. Come on, men.""Stand back!--all of you!" cried Morehouse. "Don't lay a hand on thatgate. Boys, pick your men."He called this last to his clerks, at the same instant whipping frombehind the counter a carbine, which he cocked. The assayer brought intoview a shot-gun, while the cashier and clerks armed themselves. It wasevident that the deposits of the Alaska Bank were abundantlysafeguarded."I don't aim to have any trouble with you-all," continued theSoutherner, "but that money stays here till it's drawn out right."The crowd paused at this show of resistance, but Glenister railed atthem:"Come on--come on! What's the matter with you?" And from the light inhis eye it was evident that he would not be balked.Helen felt that a crisis was come, and braced herself. These men werein deadly earnest: the white-haired banker, his pale helpers, and thosegrim, quiet ones outside. There stood brawny, sun-browned men, with setjaws and frowning faces, and yellow-haired Scandinavians in whose blueeyes danced the flame of battle. These had been baffled at every turn,goaded by repeated failure, and now stood shoulder to shoulder in theirresistance to a cruel law. Suddenly Helen heard a command from thestreet and the quick tramp of men, while over the heads before her shesaw the glint of rifle barrels. A file of soldiers with fixed bayonetsthrust themselves roughly through the crowd at the entrance."Clear the room!" commanded the officer."What does this mean?" shouted Wheaton."It means that Judge Stillman has called upon the military to guardthis gold, that's all. Come, now, move quick." The men hesitated, thensullenly obeyed, for resistance to the blue of Uncle Sam comes only atthe cost of much consideration."They're robbing us with our own soldiers," said Wheaton, when theywere outside."Ay," said Glenister, darkly. "We've tried the law, but they're forcingus back to first principles. There's going to be murder here."CHAPTER XIICOUNTERPLOTSGlenister had said that the Judge would not dare to disobey themandates of the Circuit Court of Appeals, but he was wrong. Applicationwas made for orders directing the enforcement of the writs--steps whichwould have restored possession of the Midas to its owners, as well aspossession of the treasure in bank--but Stillman refused to grant them.Wheaton called a meeting of the Swedes and their attorneys, advising ajunction of forces. Dextry, who had returned from the mountains, waspresent. When they had finished their discussion, he said:"It seems like I can always fight better when I know what the otherfeller's game is. I'm going to spy on that outfit.""We've had detectives at work for weeks," said the lawyer for theScandinavians; "but they can't find out anything we don't know already."Dextry said no more, but that night found him busied in the buildingadjoining the one wherein McNamara had his office. He had rented a backroom on the top floor, and with the help of his partner sawed throughthe ceiling into the loft and found his way thence to the roof througha hatchway. Fortunately, there was but little space between the twobuildings, and, furthermore, each boasted the square fronts common inmining-camps, which projected high enough to prevent observation fromacross the way. Thus he was enabled, without discovery, to gain theroof adjoining and to cut through into the loft. He crept cautiously inthrough the opening, and out upon a floor of joists sealed on the lowerside, then lit a candle, and, locating McNamara's office, cut apeep-hole so that by lying flat on the timbers he could command aconsiderable portion of the room beneath. Here, early the followingmorning, he camped with the patience of an Indian, emerging in thestill of that night stiff, hungry, and atrociously cross. Meanwhile,there had been another meeting of the mine-owners, and it had beendecided to send Wheaton, properly armed with affidavits and transcriptsof certain court records, back to San Francisco on the return trip ofthe Santa Maria, which had arrived in port. He was to instituteproceedings for contempt of court, and it was hoped that byextraordinary effort he could gain quick action.At daybreak Dextry returned to his post, and it was midnight before hecrawled from his hiding-place to see the lawyer and Glenister."They have had a spy on you all day, Wheaton," he began, "and they knowyou're going out to the States. You'll be arrested to-morrow morningbefore breakfast.""Arrested! What for?""I don't just remember what the crime is--bigamy, or mayhem, orattainder of treason, or something--anyway, they'll get you in jail andthat's all they want. They think you're the only lawyer that's wiseenough to cause trouble and the only one they can't bribe.""Lord! What 'll I do? They'll watch every lighter that leaves thebeach, and if they don't catch me that way, they'll search the ship.""I've thought it all out," said the old man, to whom obstruction actedas a stimulant."Yes--but how?""Leave it to me. Get your things together and be ready to duck in twohours.""I tell you they'll search the Santa Maria from stem to stern,"protested the lawyer, but Dextry had gone."Better do as he says. His schemes are good ones," recommendedGlenister, and accordingly the lawyer made preparation.In the mean time the old prospector had begun at the end of FrontStreet to make a systematic search of the gambling-houses. Although itwas very late they were running noisily, and at last he found the manhe wanted playing "Black Jack," the smell of tar in his clothes, thelilt of the sea in his boisterous laughter. Dextry drew him aside."Mac, there's only two things about you that's any good--your silenceand your seamanship. Otherwise, you're a disreppitable, drunken insect."The sailor grinned."What is it you want now? If it's concerning money, or business, or thegrowed-up side of life, run along and don't disturb the carousals of asailorman. If it's a fight, lemme get my hat.""I want you to wake up your fireman and have steam on the tug in anhour, then wait for me below the bridge. You're chartered fortwenty-four hours, and--remember, not a word.""I'm on! Compared to me the Spinks of Egyp' is as talkative as aphonograph."The old man next turned his steps to the Northern Theatre. Theperformance was still in progress, and he located the man he washunting without difficulty.Ascending the stairs, he knocked at the door of one of the boxes andcalled for Captain Stephens."I'm glad I found you, Cap," said he. "It saved me a trip out to yourship in the dark.""What's the matter?"Dextry drew him to an isolated corner. "Me an' my partner want to senda man to the States with you.""All right.""Well--er--here's the point," hesitated the miner, who rebelled atasking favors. "He's our law sharp, an' the McNamara outfit is tryin'to put the steel on him.""I don't understand.""Why, they've swore out a warrant an' aim to guard the shore to-morrow.We want you to--""Mr. Dextry, I'm not looking for trouble. I get enough in my ownbusiness.""But, see here," argued the other, "we've GOT to send him out so he canmake a pow-wow to the big legal smoke in 'Frisco. We've beencold-decked with a bum judge. They've got us into a corner an' over theropes.""I'm sorry I can't help you, Dextry, but I got mixed up in one of yourscrapes and that's plenty.""This ain't no stowaway. There's no danger to you," began Dextry, butthe officer interrupted him:"There's no need of arguing. I won't do it.""Oh, you WON'T, eh?" said the old man, beginning to lose his temper."Well, you listen to me for a minute. Everybody in camp knows that mean' the kid is on the square an' that we're gettin' the hunk passed tous. Now, this lawyer party must get away to-night or these grafterswill hitch the horses to him on some phony charge so he can't get tothe upper court. It 'll be him to the bird-cage for ninety days. He'sgoin' to the States, though, an' he's goin'--in--your--wagon! I'mtalkin' to you--man to man. If you don't take him, I'll go to thehealth inspector--he's a friend of mine--an' I'll put a crimp in youan' your steamboat, I don't want to do that--it ain't my reg'lar graftby no means--but this bet goes through as she lays. I never belched upa secret before. No, sir; I am the human huntin'-case watch, an' Iwon't open my face unless you press me. But if I should, you'll seethat it's time for you to hunt a new job. Now, here's my scheme." Heoutlined his directions to the sailor, who had fallen silent during thewarning. When he had done, Stephens said:"I never had a man talk to me like that before, sir--never. You'vetaken advantage of me, and under the circumstances I can't refuse. I'lldo this thing--not because of your threat, but because I heard aboutyour trouble over the Midas--and because I can't help admiring yourblamed insolence." He went back into his stall.Dextry returned to Wheaton's office. As he neared it, he passed alounging figure in an adjacent doorway."The place is watched," he announced as he entered. "Have you got aback door? Good! Leave your light burning and we'll go out that way."They slipped quietly into an inky, tortuous passage which led backtowards Second Street. Floundering through alleys and over garbageheaps, by circuitous routes, they reached the bridge, where, in theswift stream beneath, they saw the lights from Mac's tug.Steam was up, and when the Captain had let them aboard Dextry gave himinstructions, to which he nodded acquiescence. They bade the lawyeradieu, and the little craft slipped its moorings, danced down thecurrent, across the bar, and was swallowed up in the darkness toseaward. "I'll put out Wheaton's light so they'll think he's gone tobed.""Yes, and at daylight I'll take your place in McNamara's loft," saidGlenister. "There will be doings to-morrow when they don't find him."They returned by the way they had come to the lawyer's room,extinguished his light, went to their own cabin and to bed. At dawnGlenister arose and sought his place above McNamara's office.To lie stretched at length on a single plank with eye glued to a crackis not a comfortable position, and the watcher thought the hours of thenext day would never end. As they dragged wearily past, his bones beganto ache beyond endurance, yet owing to the flimsy structure of thebuilding he dared not move while the room below was tenanted. In fact,he would not have stirred had he dared, so intense was his interest inthe scenes being enacted beneath him.First had come the marshal, who imported his failure to find Wheaton."He left his room some time last night. My men followed him in and sawa light in his window until two o'clock this morning. At seven o'clockwe broke in and he was gone.""He must have got wind of our plan. Send deputies aboard the SantaMaria; search her from keel to topmast, and have them watch the beachclose or he'll put off in a small boat. You look over the passengersthat go aboard yourself. Don't trust any of your men for that, becausehe may try to slip through disguised. He's liable to make up like awoman. You understand--there's only one ship in port, and--he mustn'tget away.""He won't," said Voorhees, with conviction, and the listener overheadsmiled grimly to himself, for at that moment, twenty miles offshore,lay Mac's little tug, hove to in the track of the outgoing steamship,and in her tiny cabin sat Bill Wheaton eating breakfast.As the morning wore by with no news of the lawyer, McNamara'suneasiness grew. At noon the marshal returned with a report that thepassengers were all aboard and the ship about to clear."By Heavens! He's slipped through you," stormed the politician."No, he hasn't. He may be hidden aboard somewhere among thecoal-bunkers, but I think he's still ashore and aiming to make a quickrun just before she sails. He hasn't left the beach since daylight,that's sure. I'm going out to the ship now with four men and search heragain. If we don't bring him off you can bet he's lying out somewherein town and we'll get him later. I've stationed men along the shore fortwo miles.""I won't have him get away. If he should reach 'Frisco--Tell your menI'll give five hundred dollars to the one that finds him."Three hours later Voorhees returned."She sailed without him."The politician cursed. "I don't believe it. He tricked you. I know hedid."Glenister grinned into a half-eaten sandwich, then turned upon his backand lay thus on the plank, identifying the speakers below by theirvoices.He kept his post all day. Later in the evening he heard Struve enter.The man had been drinking."So he got away, eh?" he began. "I was afraid he would. Smart fellow,that Wheaton.""He didn't get away," said McNamara. "He's in town yet. Just let meland him in jail on some excuse! I'll hold him till snow flies." Struvesank into a chair and lit a cigarette with wavering hand."This's a hell of a game, ain't it, Mac? D'you s'pose we'll win?"The man overhead pricked up his ears."Win? Aren't we winning? What do you call this? I only hope we can layhands on Wheaton. He knows things. A little knowledge is a dangerousthing, but more is worse. Lord! If only I had a MAN for judge in placeof Stillman! I don't know why I brought him.""That's right. Too weak. He hasn't got the backbone of an angleworm. Heain't half the man that his niece is. THERE'S a girl for you! Say!What'd we do without her, eh? She's a pippin!" Glenister felt a suddentightening of every muscle. What right had that man's liquor-soddenlips to speak so of her?"She's a brave little woman all right. Just look how she workedGlenister and his fool partner. It took nerve to bring in thoseinstructions of yours alone; and if it hadn't been for her we'd neverhave won like this. It makes me laugh to think of those two men stowingher away in their state-room while they slept between decks with thesheep, and her with the papers in her bosom all the time. Then, when wegot ready to do business, why, she up and talks them into giving uspossession of their mine without a fight. That's what I callreciprocating a man's affection."Glenister's nails cut into his flesh, while his face went livid at thewords. He could not grasp it at once. It made him sick--physicallysick--and for many moments he strove blindly to beat back the hideoussuspicion, the horror that the lawyer had aroused. His was not adoubting disposition, and to him the girl had seemed as one pure,mysterious, apart, angelically incapable of deceit. He had loved her,feeling that some day she would return his affection without fail. Inher great, unclouded eyes he had found no lurking-place fordouble-dealing. Now--God! It couldn't be that all the time she hadKNOWN!He had lost a part of the lawyer's speech, but peered through hisobservation-hole again.McNamara was at the window gazing out into the dark street, his backtowards the lawyer, who lolled in the chair, babbling garrulously ofthe girl. Glenister ground his teeth--a frenzy possessed him to loosehis anger, to rip through the frail ceiling with naked hands and fallvindictively upon the two men."She looked good to me the first time I saw her," continued Struve. Hepaused, and when he spoke again a change had coarsened his features,"Say, I'm crazy about her, Mac. I tell you, I'm crazy--and she likesme--I know she does--or, anyway, she would--""Do you mean that you're in love with her?" asked the man at thewindow, without shifting his position. It seemed that utterindifference was in his question, although where the light shone on hishands, tight-clinched behind his back, they were bloodless."Love her? Well--that depends--ha! You know how it is--" he chuckled,coarsely. His face was gross and bestial. "I've got the Judge where Iwant him, and I'll have her--"His miserable words died with a gurgle, for McNamara had silentlyleaped and throttled him where he sat, pinning him to the wall.Glenister saw the big politician shift his fingers slightly on Struve'sthroat and then drop his left hand to his side, holding his victimwrithing and helpless with his right despite the man's franticstruggles. McNamara's head was thrust forward from his shoulders,peering into the lawyer's face. Strove tore ineffectually at the ironarm which was squeezing his life out, while for endless minutes theother leaned his weight against him, his idle hand behind his back, hislegs braced like stone columns, as he watched his victim's strugglesabate.Struve fought and wrenched while his breath caught in his throat withhorrid, sickening sounds, but gradually his eyes rolled farther andfarther back till they stared out of his blackened visage, straight uptowards the ceiling, towards the hole through which Glenister peered.His struggles lessened, his chin sagged, and his tongue protruded, thenhe sat loose and still. The politician flung him out into the room sothat he fell limply upon his face, then stood watching him. Finally,McNamara passed out of the watcher's vision, returning with awater-bucket. With his foot he rolled the unconscious wretch upon hisback, then drenched him. Replacing the pail, he seated himself, lit acigar, and watched the return of life into his victim. He made no move,even to drag him from the pool in which he lay.Struve groaned and shuddered, twisted to his side, and at last sat upweakly. In his eyes there was now a great terror, while in place of hisdrunkenness was only fear and faintness--abject fear of the great bulkthat sat and smoked and stared at him so fishily. He felt uncertainlyof his throat, and groaned again."Why did you do that?" he whispered; but the other made no sign. Hetried to rise, but his knees relaxed; he staggered and fell. At last hegained his feet and made for the door; then, when his hand was on theknob, McNamara spoke through his teeth, without removing his cigar."Don't ever talk about her again. She is going to marry me."When he was alone he looked curiously up at the ceiling over his head."The rats are thick in this shack," he mused. "Seems to me I heard awhole swarm of them."A few moments later a figure crept through the hole in the roof of thehouse next door and thence down into the street. A block ahead was theslow-moving form of Attorney Struve. Had a stranger met them both hewould not have known which of the two had felt at his throat the clutchof a strangler, for each was drawn and haggard and swayed as he went.Glenister unconsciously turned towards his cabin, but at leaving thelighted streets the thought of its darkness and silence made himshudder. Not now! He could not bear that stillness and the company ofhis thoughts. He dared not be alone. Dextry would be down-town,undoubtedly, and he, too, must get into the light and turmoil. Helicked his lips and found that they were cracked and dry.At rare intervals during the past years he had staggered in from a longmarch where, for hours, he had waged a bitter war with cold and hunger,his limbs clumsy with fatigue, his garments wet and stiff, his mindslack and sullen. At such extreme seasons he had felt a consumingthirst, a thirst which burned and scorched until his very bones criedout feverishly. Not a thirst for water, nor a thirst which eaten snowcould quench, but a savage yearning of his whole exhausted system forsome stimulant, for some coursing fiery fluid that would burn andstrangle. A thirst for whiskey--for brandy! Remembering theseoccasional ferocious desires, he had become charitable to suchunfortunates as were too weak to withstand similar temptations.Now with a shock he caught himself in the grip of a thirst as insistentas though the cold bore down and the weariness of endless heavy mileswrapped him about. It was no foolish wish to drown his thoughts nor tobanish the grief that preyed upon him, but only thirst! Thirst!--acrying, trembling, physical lust to quench the fires that burnedinside. He remembered that it had been more than a year since he hadtasted whiskey. Now the fever of the past few hours had parched hisevery tissue.As he elbowed in through the crowd at the Northern, those next him maderoom at the bar for they recognized the hunger that peers thus frommen's faces. Their manner recalled Glenister to his senses, and hewrenched himself away. This was not some solitary, snow-bankedroad-house. He would not stand and soak himself, shoulder to shoulderwith stevedores and longshoremen. This was something to be done insecret. He had no pride in it. The man on his right raised a glass, andthe young man strangled a madness to tear it from his hands. Instead,he hurried back to the theatre and up to a box, where he drew thecurtains."Whiskey!" he said, thickly, to the waiter. "Bring it to me fast. Don'tyou hear? Whiskey!"Across the theatre Cherry Malotte had seen him enter and jerk thecurtains together. She arose and went to him, entering without ceremony."What's the matter, boy?" she questioned."Ah! I am glad you came. Talk to me.""Thank you for your few well-chosen remarks," she laughed. "Why don'tyou ask me to spring some good, original jokes? You look like thefinish to a six-day go-as-you please. What's up?"She talked to him for a moment until the waiter entered, then, when shesaw what he bore, she snatched the glass from the tray and poured thewhiskey on the floor. Glenister was on his feet and had her by thewrist."What do you mean?" he said, roughly."It's whiskey, boy," she cried, "and you don't drink.""Of course it's whiskey. Bring me another," he shouted at the attendant."What's the matter?" Cherry insisted. "I never saw you act so. You knowyou don't drink. I won't let you. It's booze--booze, I tell you, fitfor fools and brawlers. Don't drink it, Roy. Are you in trouble?""I say I'm thirsty--and I will have it! How do you know what it is tosmoulder inside, and feel your veins burn dry?""It's something about that girl," the woman said, with quietconviction. "She's double-crossed you.""Well, so she has--but what of it? I'm thirsty. She's going to marryMcNamara. I've been a fool." He ground his teeth and reached for thedrink with which the boy had returned."McNamara is a crook, but he's a man, and he never drank a drop in hislife." The girl said it, casually, evenly, but the other stopped theglass half-way to his lips."Well, what of it? Goon. You're good at W. C. T. U. talk. Virtuebecomes you."She flushed, but continued, "It simply occurred to me that if youaren't strong enough to handle your own throat, you're not strongenough to beat a man who has mastered his."Glenister looked at the whiskey a moment, then set it back on the tray."Bring two lemonades," he said, and with a laugh which was half a sobCherry Malotte leaned forward and kissed him."You're too good a man to drink. Now, tell me all about it.""Oh, it's too long! I've just learned that the girl is in, hand andglove, with the Judge and McNamara--that's all. She's an advanceagent--their lookout. She brought in their instructions to Struve andpersuaded Dex and me to let them jump our claim. She got us to trust inthe law and in her uncle. Yes, she hypnotized my property out of me andgave it to her lover, this ward politician. Oh, she's smooth, with allher innocence! Why, when she smiles she makes you glad and good andwarm, and her eyes are as honest and clear as a mountain pool, butshe's wrong--she's wrong--and--great God! how I love her!" He droppedhis face into his hands.When she had pled with him for himself a moment before Cherry Malottewas genuine and girlish but now as he spoke thus of the other woman achange came over her which he was too disturbed to note. She took onthe subtleness that masked her as a rule, and her eyes were notpleasant."I could have told you all that and more.""More! What more?" he questioned."Do you remember when I warned you and Dextry that they were coming tosearch your cabin for the gold? Well, that girl put them on to you. Ifound it out afterwards. She keeps the keys to McNamara's safety vaultwhere your dust lies, and she's the one who handles the Judge. It isn'tMcNamara at all." The woman lied easily, fluently, and the man believedher."Do you remember when they broke into your safe and took that money?""Yes.""Well, what made them think you had ten thousand in there?""I don't know.""I do. Dextry told her."Glenister arose. "That's all I want to hear now. I'm going crazy. Mymind aches, for I've never had a fight like this before and it hurts.You see, I've been an animal all these years. When I wanted to drink, Idrank, and what I wanted, I got, because I've been strong enough totake it. This is new to me. I'm going down-stairs now and try to thinkof something else--then I'm going home."When he had gone she pulled back the curtains, and, leaning her chin inher hands, with elbows on the ledge, gazed down upon the crowd. Theshow was over and the dance had begun, but she did not see it, for shewas thinking rapidly with the eagerness of one who sees the end of along and weary search. She did not notice the Bronco Kid beckoning toher nor the man with him, so the gambler brought his friend along andinvaded her box. He introduced the man as Mr. Champian."Do you feel like dancing?" the new-comer inquired."No; I'd rather look on. I feel sociable. You're a society man, Mr.Champian. Don't you know anything of interest? Scandal or the like?""Can't say that I do. My wife attends to all that for the family. But Iknow there's lots of it. It's funny to me, the airs some of thesepeople assume up here, just as though we weren't all equal, north ofFifty-three. I never heard the like.""Anything new and exciting?" inquired Bronco, mildly interested."The last I heard was about the Judge's niece, Miss Chester."Cherry Malotte turned abruptly, while the Kid slowly lowered the frontlegs of his chair to the floor."What was it?" she inquired."Why, it seems she compromised herself pretty badly with this fellowGlenister coming up on the steamer last spring. Mighty brazen,according to my wife. Mrs. Champian was on the same ship and says shewas horribly shocked."Ah! Glenister had told her only half the tale, thought the girl. Thetruth was baring itself. At that moment Champian thought she looked thetypical creature of the dance-halls, the crafty, jealous, malevolentadventuress."And the hussy masquerades as a lady," she sneered."She IS a lady," said the Kid. He sat bolt upright and rigid, and theknuckles of his clinched hands were very white. In the shadow they didnot note that his dark face was ghastly, nor did he say more except tobid Champian good-bye when he left, later on. After the door hadclosed, however, the Kid arose and stretched his muscles, notlanguidly, but as though to take out the cramp of long tension. He wethis lips, and his mouth was so dry that the sound caused the girl tolook up."What are you grinning at?" Then, as the light struck his face, shestarted. "My! How you look! What ails you? Are you sick?" No one, fromDawson down, had seen the Bronco Kid as he looked to-night."No. I'm not sick," he answered, in a cracked voice.Then the girl laughed harshly."Do YOU love that girl, too? Why, she's got every man in town crazy."She wrung her hands, which is a bad sign in a capable person, and asGlenister crossed the floor below in her sight she said, "Ah-h--I couldkill him for that!""So could I," said the Kid, and left her without adieu.CHAPTER XIIIIN WHICH A MAN IS POSSESSED OF A DEVILFor a long time Cherry Malotte sat quietly thinking, removed by hermental stress to such an infinite distance from the music and turmoilbeneath that she was conscious of it only as a formless clamor. She hadtipped a chair back against the door, wedging it beneath the knob sothat she might be saved from interruption, then flung herself intoanother seat and stared unseeingly. As she sat thus, and thought, andschemed, harsh and hateful lines seemed to eat into her face. Now andthen she moaned impatiently, as though fearing lest the strategy shewas plotting might prove futile; then she would rise and pace hernarrow quarters. She was unconscious of time, and had spent perhaps twohours thus, when amid the buzz of talk in the next compartment sheheard a name which caused her to start, listen, then drop herpreoccupation like a mantle. A man was speaking of Glenister.Excitement thrilled his voice."I never saw anything like it since McMaster's Night in Virginia City,thirteen years ago. He's RIGHT.""Well, perhaps so," the other replied, doubtfully, "but I don't care toback you. I never 'staked' a man in my life.""Then LEND me the money. I'll pay it back in an hour, but for Heaven'ssake be quick. I tell you he's as right as a golden guinea. It's thelucky night of his life. Why, he turned over the Black Jack game infour bets. In fifteen minutes more we can't get close enough to a tableto send in our money with a messenger-boy--every sport in camp will behere.""I'll stake you to fifty," the second man replied, in a tone thatshowed a trace of his companion's excitement.So Glenister was gambling, the girl learned, and with such luck as tobreak the Black Jack game and excite the greed of every gambler incamp. News of his winnings had gone out into the street, and thesporting men were coming to share his fortune, to fatten like vultureson the adversity of their fellows. Those who had no money to stake wereborrowing, like the man next door.She left her retreat, and, descending the stairs, was greeted by astrange sight. The dance-hall was empty of all but the musicians, whoblew and fiddled lustily in vain endeavor to draw from the rapidlyswelling crowd that thronged the gambling-room and stretched to thedoor. The press was thickest about a table midway down the hall. Cherrycould see nothing of what went on there, for men and women stood tendeep about it and others perched on chairs and tables along the walls.A roar arose suddenly, followed by utter silence; then came the clinkand rattle of silver. A moment, and the crowd resumed its laughter andtalk."All down, boys," sounded the level voice of the dealer. "The field orthe favorite. He's made eighteen straight passes. Get your money on theline." There ensued another breathless instant wherein she heard thethud of dice, then followed the shout of triumph that told what thespots revealed. The dealer payed off. Glenister reared himself head andshoulders above the others and pushed out through the ring to theroulette-wheel. The rest followed. Behind the circular table they hadquitted, the dealer was putting away his dice, and there was not a coinin his rack. Mexico Mullins approached Cherry, and she questioned him."He just broke the crap game," Mullins told her; "nineteen passeswithout losing the bones.""How much did he win?""Oh, he didn't win much himself, but it's the people betting with himthat does the damage! They're gamblers, most of them, and they play thelimit. He took out the Black Jack bank-roll first, $4,000, then cleanedthe 'Tub.' By that time the tin horns began to come in. It's thegreatest run I ever see.""Did you get in?""Now, don't you know that I never play anything but 'bank'? If he lastslong enough to reach the faro lay-out, I'll get mine."The excitement of the crowd began to infect the girl, even though shelooked on from the outside. The exultant voices, the sudden hush, thetensity of nerve it all betokened, set her a-thrill. A stranger leftthe throng and rushed to the spot where Cherry and Mexico stoodtalking. He was small and sandy, with shifting glance and chinless jaw.His eyes glittered, his teeth shone rat-like through his dry lips, andhis voice was shrill. He darted towards them like some furtive,frightened little animal, unnaturally excited."I guess that isn't so bad for three bets!" He shook a sheaf ofbank-notes at them."Why don't you stick?" inquired Mullins."I am too wise. Ha! I know when to quit. He can't win steady--he don'tplay any system.""Then he has a good chance," said the girl."There he goes now," the little man cried as the uproar arose. "I toldyou he'd lose." At the voice of the multitude he wavered as thoughaffected by some powerful magnet."But he won again," said Mexico."No! Did he? Lord! I quit too soon!"He scampered back into the other room, only to return, hesitating, hismoney tightly clutched."Do you s'pose it's safe? I never saw a man bet so reckless. I guessI'd better quit, eh?" He noted the sneer on the woman's face, andwithout waiting a reply dashed off again. They saw him clamorouslyfight his way in towards a post at the roulette-table. "Let me through!I've got money and I want to play it!""Pah!" said Mullins, disgustedly. "He's one of them Vermont desperadoesthat never laid a bet till he was thirty. If Glenister loses he'll hatehim for life.""There are plenty of his sort here," the girl remarked; "his soul wouldfit in a flea-track." She spied the Bronco Kid sauntering back towardsher and joined him. He leaned against the wall, watching the gossamerthread of smoke twist upward from his cigarette, seemingly oblivious tothe surroundings, and showing no hint of the emotion he had displayedtwo hours before."This is a big killing, isn't it?" said the girl. The gambler nodded,murmuring indifferently."Why aren't you dealing bank? Isn't this your shift?""I quit last night.""Just in time to miss this affair. Lucky for you.""Yes; I own the place now. Bought it yesterday.""Good Heavens! Then it's YOUR money he's winning.""Sure, at the rate of a thousand a minute."She glanced at the long trail of devastated tables behind Glenister andhis followers. At that instant the sound told that the miner had wonagain, and it dawned upon Cherry that the gambler beside her stood tooquietly, that his hand and voice were too steady, his glance too coldto be natural. The next moment approved her instinct.The musicians, grown tired of their endeavors to lure back the dancers,determined to join the excitement, and ceased playing. The leader laiddown his violin, the pianist trailed up the key-board with a departingtwitter and quit his stool. They all crossed the hall, headed for thecrowd, some of them making ready to bet. As they approached the BroncoKid, his lips thinned and slid apart slightly, while out of hisheavy-lidded eyes there flared unreasoning rage. Stepping forward, heseized the foremost man and spun him about violently."Where are you going?""Why, nobody wants to dance, so we thought we'd go out front for a bit.""Get back, damn you!" It was his first chance to vent the passionwithin him. A glance at his maddened features was sufficient for themusicians, and they did not delay. By the time they had resumed theirduties, however, the curtains of composure had closed upon the Kid,masking his emotion again; but from her brief glimpse Cherry Malotteknew that this man was not of ice, as some supposed. He turned to herand said, "Do you mean what you said up-stairs?""I don't understand.""You said you could kill Glenister.""I could.""Don't you love--""I HATE him," she interrupted, hoarsely. He gave her a mirthless smile,and spying the crap-dealer leaving his bankrupt table, called him overand said:"Toby, I want you to 'drive the hearse' when Glenister begins to playfaro. I'll deal. Understand?""Sure! Going to give him a little 'work,' eh?""I never dealt a crooked card in this camp," exclaimed the Kid, "butI'll 'lay' that man to-night or I'll kill him! I'll use a 'sand-tell,'see! And I want to explain my signals to you. If you miss the signsyou'll queer us both and put the house on the blink."He rapidly rehearsed his signals in a jargon which to a layman wouldhave been unintelligible, illustrating them by certain almostimperceptible shiftings of the fingers or changes in the position ofhis hand, so slight as to thwart discovery. Through it all the girlstood by and followed his every word and motion with eager attention.She needed no explanation of the terms they used. She knew them all,knew that the "hearse-driver" was the man who kept the cases, knew allthe code of the "inside life." To her it was all as an open page, andshe memorized more quickly than did Toby the signs by which the BroncoKid proposed to signal what card he had smuggled from the box or heldback.In faro it is customary for the case-keeper to sit on the opposite sideof the table from the dealer, with a device before him resembling anabacus, or Chinese adding-machine. When a card is removed from thefaro-box by the dealer, the "hearse-driver" moves a button opposite acorresponding card on his little machine, in order that the players, ata glance, may tell what spots have been played or are still in the box.His duties, though simple, are important, for should he make an error,and should the position of his counters not tally with the cards in thebox on the "last turn," all bets on the table are declared void. Whenhonestly dealt, faro is the fairest of all gambling games, but it isintricate, and may hide much knavery. When the game is crooked, it isfatal, for out of the ingenuity of generations of card sharks therehave been evolved a multitude of devices with which to fleece theunsuspecting. These are so carefully masked that none but the initiatedmay know them, while the freemasonry of the craft is strong anddiscovery unusual.Instead of using a familiar arrangement like the "needle-tell," whereinan invisible needle pricks the dealer's thumb, thus signalling thepresence of certain cards, the Bronco Kid had determined to use the"sand-tell." In other words, he would employ a "straight box," but adeck of cards, certain ones of which had been roughened or sand-paperedslightly, so that, by pressing more heavily on the top or exposed card,the one beneath would stick to its neighbor above, and thus enable himto deal two with one motion if the occasion demanded. This roughnesswould likewise enable him to detect the hidden presence of a markedcard by the faintest scratching sound when he dealt. In thismanipulation it would be necessary, also, to shave the edges of some ofthe pasteboards a trifle, so that, when the deck was forced firmlyagainst one side of the box, there would be exposed a fraction of thesmall figure in the left-hand corner of the concealed cards. Longpractice in the art of jugglery lends such proficiency as to bafflediscovery and rob the game of its uncertainty as surely as the playeris robbed of his money. It is, of course, vital that the confederatecase-keeper be able to interpret the dealer's signs perfectly in orderto move the sliding ebony disks to correspond, else trouble will accrueat the completion of the hand when the cases come out wrong.Having completed his instructions, the proprietor went forward, andCherry wormed her way towards the roulette-wheel. She wished to watchGlenister, but could not get near him because of the crowd. The menwould not make room for her. Every eye was glued upon the table asthough salvation lurked in its rows of red and black. They were packedbehind it until the croupier had barely room to spin the ball, andalthough he forced them back, they pressed forward again inch by inch,drawn by the song of the ivory, drunk with its worship, maddened by thebreath of Chance.Cherry gathered that Glenister was still winning, for a glimpse of thewheel-rack between the shoulders of those ahead showed that the checkswere nearly out of it.Plainly it was but a question of minutes, so she backed out and tookher station beside the faro-table where the Bronco Kid was dealing. Hisface wore its colorless mask of indifference; his long white handsmoved slowly with the certainty that betokened absolute mastery of hisart. He was waiting. The ex-crap dealer was keeping cases.The group left the roulette-table in a few moments and surrounded her,Glenister among the others. He was not the man she knew. In place ofthe dreary hopelessness with which he had left her, his face wasflushed and reckless, his collar was open, showing the base of hisgreat, corded neck, while the lust of the game had coarsened him tillhe was again the violent, untamed, primitive man of the frontier. Hisself-restraint and dignity were gone. He had tried the new ways, andthey were not for him. He slipped back, and the past swallowed him.After leaving Cherry he had sought some mental relief by idly riskingthe silver in his pocket. He had let the coins lie and double, thendouble again and again. He had been indifferent whether he won or lost,so assumed a reckless disregard for the laws of probability, thinkingthat he would shortly lose the money he had won and then go home. Hedid not want it. When his luck remained the same, he raised the stakes,but it did not change--he could not lose. Before he realized it, othermen were betting with him, animated purely by greed and craze of thesport. First one, then another joined till game after game was closed,and each moment the crowd had grown in size and enthusiasm so that itsfever crept into him, imperceptibly at first, but ever increasing, tillthe mania mastered him.He paid no attention to Cherry as he took his seat. He had eyes fornothing but the "lay-out." She clenched her hands and prayed for hisruin."What's your limit, Kid?" he inquired."One hundred, and two," the Kid answered, which in the vernacular meansthat any sum up to $200 be laid on one card save only on the last turn,when the amount is lessened by half.Without more ado they commenced. The Kid handled his cards smoothly,surely, paying and taking bets with machine-like calm. The on-lookersceased talking and prepared to watch, for now came the crucial test ofthe evening. Faro is to other games as war is to jackstraws.For a time Glenister won steadily till there came a moment when manystacks of chips lay on the deuce. Cherry saw the Kid "flash" to thecase-keeper, and the next moment he had "pulled two." The deuce lost.It was his first substantial gain, and the players paid no attention.At the end of half an hour the winnings were slightly in favor of the"house." Then Glenister said, "This is too slow. I want action.""All right," smiled the proprietor. "We'll double the limit."Thus it became possible to wager $400 on a card, and the Kid beganreally to play. Glenister now lost steadily, not in large amounts, butwith tantalizing regularity. Cherry had never seen cards played likethis. The gambler was a revelation to her--his work was wonderful. Illluck seemed to fan the crowd's eagerness, while, to add to itsimpatience, the cases came wrong twice in succession, so that those whowould have bet heavily upon the last turn had their money given back.Cherry saw the confusion of the "hearse-driver" even quicker than didBronco. Toby was growing rattled. The dealer's work was too fast forhim, and yet he could offer no signal of distress for fear ofannihilation at the hands of those crowded close to his shoulder. Inthe same way the owner of the game could make no objection to hishelper's incompetence for fear that some by-stander would volunteer tofill the man's part--there were many present capable of the trick. Hecould only glare balefully across the table at his unfortunateconfederate.They had not gone far on the next game before Cherry's quick eyedetected a sign which the man misinterpreted. She addressed him,quietly, "You'd better brush up your plumes."In spite of his anger the Bronco Kid smiled. Humor in him was strangelywithered and distorted, yet here was a thrust he would always rememberand recount with glee in years to come. He feared there were otherfaro-dealers present who might understand the hint, but there was nonesave Mexico Mullins, whose face was a study--mirth seemed to bestrangling him. A moment later the girl spoke to the case-keeper again."Let me take your place; your reins are unbuckled."Toby glanced inquiringly at the Kid, who caught Cherry's reassuringlook and nodded, so he arose and the girl slid into the vacant chair.This woman would make no errors--the dealer knew that; her keen witswere sharpened by hate--it showed in her face. If Glenister escapeddestruction to-night it would be because human means could notaccomplish his downfall.In the mind of the new case-keeper there was but one thought--Roy mustbe broken. Humiliation, disgrace, ruin, ridicule were to be his. If heshould be downed, discredited, and discouraged, then, perhaps, he wouldturn to her as he had in the by-gone days. He was slipping away fromher--this was her last chance. She began her duties easily, and heralertness stimulated Bronco till his senses, too, grew sharper, hisobservation more acute and lightning-like. Glenister swore beneath hisbreath that the cards were bewitched. He was like a drunken man, now astruly intoxicated as though the fumes of wine had befogged his brain.He swayed in his seat, the veins of his neck thickened and throbbed,his features were congested. After a while he spoke."I want a bigger limit. Is this some boy's game? Throw her open."The gambler shot a triumphant glance at the girl and acquiesced. "Allright, the limit is the blue sky. Pile your checks to the roof-pole."He began to shuffle.Within the crowded circle the air was hot and fetid with the breath ofmen. The sweat trickled down Glenister's brown skin, dripping from hisjaw unnoticed. He arose and ripped off his coat, while those standingbehind shifted and scuffed their feet impatiently. Besides Roy, therewere but three men playing. They were the ones who had won heaviest atfirst. Now that luck was against them they were loath to quit.Cherry was annoyed by stertorous breathing at her shoulder, and glancedback to find the little man who had been so excited earlier in theevening. His mouth was agape, his eyes wide, the muscles about his lipstwitching. He had lost back, long since, the hundreds he had won andmore besides. She searched the figures walling her about and saw nowomen. They had been crowded out long since. It seemed as though thetable formed the bottom of a sloping pit of human faces--eager, tense,staring. It was well she was here, she thought, else this task mightfail. She would help to blast Glenister, desolate him, humiliate him.Ah, but wouldn't she!Roy bet $100 on the "popular" card. On the third turn he lost. He bet$200 next and lost. He set out a stack of $400 and lost for the thirdtime. Fortune had turned her face. He ground his teeth and doubleduntil the stakes grew enormous, while the dealer dealt monotonously.The spots flashed and disappeared, taking with them wager after wager.Glenister became conscious of a raging, red fury which he had hardshift to master. It was not his money--what if he did lose? He wouldstay until he won. He would win. This luck would not, could not,last--and yet with diabolic persistence he continued to choose thelosing cards. The other men fared better till be yielded to theirjudgment, when the dealer took their money also.Strange to say, the fickle goddess had really shifted her banner atlast, and the Bronco Kid was dealing straight faro now. He was too gooda player to force a winning hand, and Glenister's ill-fortune became asphenomenal as his winning had been. The girl who figured in this dramawas keyed to the highest tension, her eyes now on her counters, nowsearching the profile of her victim. Glenister continued to lose andlose and lose, while the girl gloated over his swift-coming ruin. Whenat long intervals he won a bet she shrank and shivered for fear hemight escape. If only he would risk it all--everything he had. He wouldhave to come to her then!The end was closer than she realized. The throng hung breathless uponeach move of the players, while there was no sound but the noise ofshifting chips and the distant jangle of the orchestra. The lookout satfar forward upon his perch, his hands upon his knees, his eyes frozento the board, a dead cigar clenched between his teeth. Crowded upon hisplatform were miners tense and motionless as statues. When a man spokeor coughed, a score of eyes stared at him accusingly, then dropped tothe table again.Glenister took from his clothes a bundle of bank-notes, so thick thatit required his two hands to compass it. On-lookers saw that the billswere mainly yellow. No one spoke while he counted them rapidly, glancedat the dealer, who nodded, then slid them forward till they rested onthe king. He placed a "copper" on the pile. A great sigh of indrawnbreaths swept through the crowd. The North had never known a bet likethis--it meant a fortune. Here was a tale for one's grandchildren--thata man should win opulence in an evening, then lose it in one deal. Thisfinal bet represented more than many of them had ever seen a one timebefore. Its fate lay on a single card.Cherry Malotte's fingers were like ice and shook till the buttons ofher case-keeper rattled, her heart raced till she could not breathe,while something rose up and choked her. If Glenister won this bet hewould quit; she felt it. If he lost, ah! what could the Kid there feel,the man who was playing for a paltry vengeance, compared to her whosehope of happiness, of love, of life hinged on this wager?Evidently the Bronco Kid knew what card lay next below, for he offeredher no sign, and as Glenister leaned back he slowly and firmly pushedthe top card out of the box. Although this was the biggest turn of hislife, he betrayed no tremor. His gesture displayed the nine ofdiamonds, and the crowd breathed heavily. The king had not won. Wouldit lose? Every gaze was welded to the tiny nickelled box. If theface-card lay next beneath the nine-spot, the heaviest wager in Alaskawould have been lost; if it still remained hidden on the next turn, themoney would be safe for a moment.Slowly the white hand of the dealer moved back; his middle fingertouched the nine of diamonds; it slid smoothly out of the box, andthere in its place frowned the king of clubs. At last the silence wasbroken.Men spoke, some laughed, but in their laughter was no mirth. It wasmore like the sound of choking. They stamped their feet to relieve thegrip of strained muscles. The dealer reached forth and slid the stackof bills into the drawer at his waist without counting. The case-keeperpassed a shaking hand over her face, and when it came away she sawblood on her fingers where she had sunk her teeth into her lower lip.Glenister did not rise. He sat, heavy-browed and sullen, his jaw thrustforward, his hair low upon his forehead, his eyes bloodshot and dead."I'll sit the hand out if you'll let me bet the 'finger,'" said he."Certainly," replied the dealer.When a man requests this privilege it means that he will call theamount of his wager without producing the visible stakes, and thedealer may accept or refuse according to his judgment of the bettor'sresponsibility. It is safe, for no man shirks a gambling debt in theNorth, and thousands may go with a nod of the head though never a centbe on the board.There were still a few cards in the box, and the dealer turned them,paying the three men who played. Glenister took no part, but sat bulkedover his end of the table glowering from beneath his shock of hair.Cherry was deathly tired. The strain of the last hour had been sointense that she could barely sit in her seat, yet she was determinedto finish the hand. As Bronco paused before the last turn, many of theby-standers made bets. They were the "case-players" who risked moneyonly on the final pair, thus avoiding the chance of two cards of likedenomination coming together, in which event ("splits" it is called)the dealer takes half the money. The stakes were laid at last and thedeal about to start when Glenister spoke. "Wait! What's this placeworth, Bronco?""What do you mean?""You own this outfit?" He waved his hand about the room. "Well, whatdoes it stand you?"The gambler hesitated an instant while the crowd pricked up its ears,and the girl turned wondering, troubled eyes upon the miner. What wouldhe do now?"Counting bank rolls, fixtures, and all, about a hundred and twentythousand dollars. Why?""I'll pick the ace to lose, my one-half interest in the Midas againstyour whole damned lay-out!"There was an absolute hush while the realization of this offer smotethe on-lookers. It took time to realize it. This man was insane. Therewere three cards to choose from--one would win, one would lose, and onewould have no action.Of all those present only Cherry Malotte divined even vaguely the realreason which prompted the man to do this. It was not "gameness," noraltogether a brutish stubbornness which would not let him quit, It wassomething deeper. He was desolate and his heart was gone. Helen waslost to him--worse yet, was unworthy, and she was all he cared for.What did he want of the Midas with its lawsuits, its intrigues, and itstrickery? He was sick of it all--of the whole game--and wanted to getaway. If he won, very well. If he lost, the land of the Aurora wouldknow him no more.When he put his proposition, the Bronco Kid dropped his eyes as thoughdebating. The girl saw that he studied the cards in his box intentlyand that his fingers caressed the top one ever so softly during theinstant the eyes of the rest were on Glenister. The dealer looked up atlast, and Cherry saw the gleam of triumph in his eye; he could not maskit from her, though his answering words were hesitating. She knew bythe look that Glenister was a pauper."Come on," insisted Roy, hoarsely. "Turn the cards.""You're on!"The girl felt that she was fainting. She wanted to scream. The triumphof this moment stifled her--or was it triumph, after all? She heard thebreath of the little man behind her rattle as though he were beingthrottled, and saw the lookout pass a shaking hand to his chin, thenwet his parched lips. She saw the man she had helped to ruin bendforward, his lean face strained and hard, an odd look of pain andweariness in his eyes. She never forgot that look. The crowd was frozenin various attitudes of eagerness, although it had not yet recoveredfrom the suspense of the last great wager. It knew the Midas and whatit meant. Here lay half of it, hidden beneath a tawdry square ofpasteboard. With maddening deliberation the Kid dealt the top card.Beneath it was the trey of spades. Glenister said no word nor made amove. Some one coughed, and it sounded like a gunshot. Slowly thedealer's fingers retraced their way. He hesitated purposely and leeredat the girl, then the three-spot disappeared and beneath it lay the aceas the king had lain on that other wager. It spelled utter ruin toGlenister. He raised his eyes blindly, and then the deathlike silenceof the room was shattered by a sudden crash. Cherry Malotte had closedher check-rack violently, at the same instant crying shrill and clear:"That bet is off! The cases are wrong!"Glenister half rose, overturning his chair; the Kid lunged forwardacross the table, and his wonderful hands, tense and talon-like, thrustthemselves forward as though reaching for the riches she had snatchedaway. They worked and writhed and trembled as though in dumb fury, thenails sinking into the oil-cloth table-cover. His face grew livid andcruel, while his eyes blazed at her till she shrank from himaffrightedly, bracing herself away from the table with rigid arms.Reason came slowly back to Glenister, and understanding with it. Heseemed to awake from a nightmare. He could read all too plainly thegambler's look of baffled hate as the man sprawled on the table, hisarms spread wide, his eyes glaring at the cowering woman, who shrankbefore him like a rabbit before a snake. She tried to speak, butchoked. Then the dealer came to himself, and cried harshly through histeeth one word:"Christ!"He raised his fist and struck the table so violently that chips andcoppers leaped and rolled, and Cherry closed her eyes to lose sight ofhis awful grimace. Glenister looked down on him and said:"I think I understand; but the money was yours, anyhow, so I don'tmind." His meaning was plain. The Kid suddenly jerked open the drawerbefore him, but Glenister clenched his right hand and leaned forward.The miner could have killed him with a blow, for the gambler was seatedand at his mercy. The Kid checked himself, while his face began totwitch as though the nerves underlying it had broken bondage and weredancing in a wild, ungovernable orgy."You have taught me a lesson," was all that Glenister said, and withthat he pushed through the crowd and out into the cool night air.Overhead the arctic stars winked at him, and the sea smells struck him,clean and fresh. As he went homeward he heard the distant,full-throated plaint of a wolf-dog. It held the mystery and sadness ofthe North. He paused, arid, baring his thick, matted head, stood for along time gathering himself together. Standing so, he made certaincovenants with himself, and vowed solemnly never to touch another card.At the same moment Cherry Malotte came hurrying to her cottage door,fleeing as though from pursuit or from some hateful, haunted spot. Shepaused before entering and flung her arms outward into the dark in awide gesture of despair."Why did I do it? Oh! WHY did I do it? I can't understand myself."CHAPTER XIVA MIDNIGHT MESSENGER"My dear Helen, don't you realize that my official position carrieswith it a certain social obligation which it is our duty to discharge?""I suppose so, Uncle Arthur; but I would much rather stay at home.""Tut, tut! Go and have a good time.""Dancing doesn't appeal to me any more. I left that sort of thing backhome. Now, if you would only come along--""No--I'm too busy. I must work to-night, and I'm not in a mood for suchthings, anyhow.""You're not well," his niece said. "I have noticed it for weeks. Is ithard work or are you truly ill? You're nervous; you don't eat; you'regrowing positively gaunt. Why--you're getting wrinkles like an oldman." She rose from her seat at the breakfast-table and went to him,smoothing his silvered head with affection.He took her cool hand and pressed it to his cheek, while the worry thathaunted him habitually of late gave way to a smile."It's work, little girl--hard and thankless work, that's all. Thiscountry is intended for young men, and I'm too far along." His eyesgrew grave again, and he squeezed her fingers nervously as though atthe thought. "It's a terrible country--this--I--I--wish we had neverseen it.""Don't say that," Helen cried, spiritedly. "Why, it's glorious. Thinkof the honor. You're a United States judge and the first one to comehere. You're making history--you're building a State--people will readabout you." She stooped and kissed him; but he seemed to flinch beneathher caress."Of course I'll go if you think I'd better," she said, "though I'm notfond of Alaskan society. Some of the women are nice, but the others--"She shrugged her dainty shoulders. "They talk scandal all the time. Onewould think that a great, clean, fresh, vigorous country like thiswould broaden the women as it broadens the men--but it doesn't.""I'll tell McNamara to call for you at nine o'clock," said the Judge ashe arose. So, later in the day she prepared her long unused finery tosuch good purpose that when her escort called for her that evening hebelieved her the loveliest of women.Upon their arrival at the hotel he regarded her with a fresh access ofpride, for the function proved to bear little resemblance to amining-camp party. The women wore handsome gowns, and every man was inevening dress. The wide hall ran the length of the hotel and wasflanked with boxes, while its floor was like polished glass and itswalls effectively decorated."Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed Helen as she first caught sight of it."It's just like home.""I've seen quick-rising cities before," he said, "but nothing likethis. Still, if these Northerners can build a railroad in a month and acity in a summer, why shouldn't they have symphony orchestras and LouisQuinze ballrooms?""I know you're a splendid dancer," she said."You shall be my judge and jury. I'll sign this card as often as I darewithout the certainty of violence at the hands of these young men, andthe rest of the time I'll smoke in the lobby. I don't care to dancewith any one but you."After the first waltz he left her surrounded by partners and made hisway out of the ballroom. This was his first relaxation since landing inthe North. It was well not to become a dull boy, he mused, and as hechewed his cigar he pictured with an odd thrill, quite unusual withhim, that slender, gray-eyed girl, with her coiled mass of hair, herivory shoulders, and merry smile. He saw her float past to the measureof a two-step, and caught himself resenting the thought of anotherman's enjoyment of the girl's charms even for an instant."Hold on, Alec," he muttered. "You're too old a bird to lose yourhead." However, he was waiting for her before the time for their nextdance. She seemed to have lost a part of her gayety."What's the matter? Aren't you enjoying yourself?""Oh, yes!" she returned, brightly. "I'm having a delightful time."When he came for his third dance, she was more distraite than ever. Ashe led her to a seat they passed a group of women, among whom were Mrs.Champian and others whom he knew to be wives of men prominent in thetown. He had seen some of them at tea in Judge Stillman's house, andtherefore was astonished when they returned his greeting but ignoredHelen. She shrank slightly, and he realized that there was somethingwrong; he could not guess what. Affairs of men he could cope with, butthe subtleties of women were out of his realm."What ails those people? Have they offended you?""I don't know what it is. I have spoken to them, but they cut me.""Cut YOU?" he exclaimed."Yes." Her voice trembled, but she held her head high. "It seems asthough all the women in Nome were here and in league to ignore me. Itdazes me--I do not understand.""Has anybody said anything to you?" he inquired, fiercely. "Any man, Imean?""No, no! The men are kind. It's the women.""Come--we'll go home.""Indeed, we will not," she said, proudly. "I shall stay and face itout. I have done nothing to run away from, and I intend to find outwhat is the matter."When he had surrendered her, at the beginning of the next dance,McNamara sought for some acquaintance whom he might question. Most ofthe men in Nome either hated or feared him, but he espied one that hethought suited his purpose, and led him into a corner."I want you to answer a question. No beating about the bush.Understand? I'm blunt, and I want you to be.""All right.""Your wife has been entertained at Miss Chester's house. I've seen herthere. To-night she refuses to speak to the girl. She cut her dead, andI want to know what it's about.""How should I know?""If you don't know, I'll ask you to find out."The other shook his head amusedly, at which McNamara flared up."I say you will, and you'll make your wife apologize before she leavesthis hall, too, or you'll answer to me, man to man. I won't stand tohave a girl like Miss Chester cold-decked by a bunch of mining-campswells, and that goes as it lies." In his excitement, McNamara revertedto his Western idiom.The other did not reply at once, for it is embarrassing to deal with aperson who disregards the conventions utterly, and at the same time hasthe inclination and force to compel obedience. The boss's reputationhad gone abroad."Well--er--I know about it in a general way, but of course I don't gomuch on such things. You'd better let it drop.""Go on.""There has been a lot of talk among the ladies about--well, er--thefact is, it's that young Glenister. Mrs. Champian had the nextstate-room to them--er--him--I should say--on the way up from theStates, and she saw things. Now, as far as I'm concerned, a girl can dowhat she pleases, but Mrs. Champian has her own ideas of propriety.From what my wife could learn, there's some truth in the story, too, soyou can't blame her."With a word McNamara could have explained the gossip and made this manput his wife right, forcing through her an elucidation of the sillyaffair in such a way as to spare Helen's feelings and cover thebusy-tongued magpies with confusion. Yet he hesitated. It is a wiseskipper who trims his sails to every breeze. He thanked his informantand left him. Entering the lobby, he saw the girl hurrying towards him."Take me away, quick! I want to go home.""You've changed your mind?"'"Yes, let us go," she panted, and when they were outside she walked sorapidly that he had difficulty in keeping pace with her. She wassilent, and he knew better than to question, but when they arrived ather house he entered, took off his overcoat, and turned up the light inthe tiny parlor. She flung her wraps over a chair, storming back andforth like a little fury. Her eyes were starry with tears of anger, herface was flushed, her hands worked nervously. He leaned against themantel, watching her through his cigar smoke."You needn't tell me," he said, at length. "I know all about it.""I am glad you do. I never could repeat what they said. Oh, it wasbrutal!" Her voice caught and she bit her lip. "What made me ask them?Why didn't I keep still? After you left, I went to those women andfaced them. Oh, but they were brutal? Yet, why should I care?" Shestamped her slippered foot."I shall have to kill that man some day," he said, flecking his cigarashes into the grate."What man?" She stood still and looked at him."Glenister, of course. If I had thought the story would ever reach you,I'd have shut him up long ago.""It didn't come from him," she cried, hot with indignation. "He's agentleman. It's that cat, Mrs. Champian."He shrugged his shoulders the slightest bit, but it was eloquent, andshe noted it. "Oh, I don't mean that he did it intentionally--he's toodecent a chap for that--but anybody's tongue will wag to a beautifulgirl! My lady Malotte is a jealous trick.""Malotte! Who is she?" Helen questioned, curiously.He seemed surprised. "I thought every one knew who she is. It's just aswell that you don't.""I am sure Mr. Glenister would not talk of me." There was a pause. "Whois Miss Malotte?"He studied for a moment, while she watched him. What a splendid figurehe made in his evening clothes! The cosey room with its shaded lightsenhanced his size and strength and rugged outlines. In his eyes wasthat admiration which women live for. He lifted his bold, handsome faceand met her gaze."I had rather leave that for you to find out, for I'm not much atscandal. I have something more important to tell you. It's the mostimportant thing I have ever said to you, Helen." It was the first timehe had used that name, and she began to tremble, while her eyes soughtthe door in a panic. She had expected this moment, and yet was notready."Not to-night--don't say it now," she managed to articulate."Yes, this is a good time. If you can't answer, I'll come backto-morrow. I want you to be my wife. I want to give you everything theworld offers, and I want to make you happy, girl. There'll be no gossiphereafter--I'll shield you from everything unpleasant, and if there isanything you want in life, I'll lay it at your feet. I can do it." Helifted his massive arms, and in the set of his strong, square face wasthe promise that she should have whatever she craved if mortal mancould give it to her--love, protection, position, adoration.She stammered uncertainly till the humiliation and chagrin she hadsuffered this night swept over her again. This town--this crude,half-born mining-camp--had turned against her, misjudged her cruelly.The women were envious, clacking scandal-mongers, all of them, whowould ostracize her and make her life in the Northland a misery, makeher an outcast with nothing to sustain her but her own solitary pride.She could picture her future clearly, pitilessly, and see herselfstanding alone, vilified, harassed in a thousand cutting ways, yetunable to run away, or to explain. She would have to stay and face it,for her life was bound up here during the next few years or so, or aslong as her uncle remained a judge. This man would free her. He lovedher; he offered her everything. He was bigger than all the restcombined. They were his playthings, and they knew it. She was not surethat she loved him, but his magnetism was overpowering, and heradmiration intense. No other man she had ever known compared with him,except Glenister--Bah! The beast! He had insulted her at first; hewronged her now."Will you be my wife, Helen?" the man repeated, softly.She dropped her head, and he strode forward to take her in his arms,then stopped, listening. Some one ran up on the porch and hammeredloudly at the door. McNamara scowled, walked into the hall, and flungthe portal open, disclosing Struve."Hello, McNamara! Been looking all over for you. There's the deuce topay!" Helen sighed with relief and gathered up her cloak, while the humof their voices reached her indistinctly. She was given plenty of timeto regain her composure before they appeared. When they did, thepolitician spoke, sourly:"I've been called to the mines, and I must go at once.""You bet! It may be too late now. The news came an hour ago, but Icouldn't find you," said Struve. "Your horse is saddled at the office.Better not wait to change your clothes.""You say Voorhees has gone with twenty deputies, eh? That's good. Youstay here and find out all you can.""I telephoned out to the Creek for the boys to arm themselves and throwout pickets. If you hurry you can get there in time. It's only midnightnow.""What is the trouble?" Miss Chester inquired, anxiously."There's a plot on to attack the mines to-night," answered the lawyer."The other side are trying to seize them, and there's apt to be afight.""You mustn't go out there," she cried, aghast. "There will bebloodshed.""That's just why I MUST go," said McNamara. "I'll come back in themorning, though, and I'd like to see you alone. Good-night!" There wasa strange, new light in his eyes as he left her. For one unversed inwoman's ways he played the game surprisingly well, and as he hurriedtowards his office he smiled grimly into the darkness."She'll answer me to-morrow. Thank you, Mr. Glenister," he said tohimself.Helen questioned Struve at length, but gained nothing more than thatsecret-service men had been at work for weeks and had to-day unearthedthe fact that Vigilantes had been formed. They had heard enough to makethem think the mines would be jumped again to-night, and so had giventhe alarm."Have you hired spies?" she asked, incredulously."Sure. We had to. The other people shadowed us, and it's come to apoint where it's life or death to one side or the other. I toldMcNamara we'd have bloodshed before we were through, when he firstoutlined the scheme--I mean when the trouble began."She wrung her hands. "That's what uncle feared before we left Seattle.That's why I took the risks I did in bringing you those papers. Ithought you got them in time to avoid all this."Struve laughed a bit, eying her curiously."Does Uncle Arthur know about this?" she continued."No, we don't let him know anything more than necessary; he's not astrong man.""Yes, yes. He's not well." Again the lawyer smiled. "Who is behind thisVigilante movement?""We think it is Glenister and his New Mexican bandit partner. At leastthey got the crowd together." She was silent for a time."I suppose they really think they own those mines.""Undoubtedly.""But they don't, do they?" Somehow this question had recurred to herinsistently of late, for things were constantly happening which showedthere was more back of this great, fierce struggle than she knew. Itwas impossible that injustice had been done the mine-owners, and yetscattered talk reached her which was puzzling. When she strove tofollow it up, her acquaintances adroitly changed the subject. She wasbaffled on every side. The three local newspapers upheld the court. Sheread them carefully, and was more at sea than ever. There was adisturbing undercurrent of alarm and unrest that caused her to feelinsecure, as though standing on hollow ground."Yes, this whole disturbance is caused by those two. Only for them we'dbe all right.""Who is Miss Malotte?"He answered, promptly: "The handsomest woman in the North, and the mostdangerous.""In what way? Who is she?""It's hard to say who or what she is--she's different from other women.She came to Dawson in the early days--just came--we didn't know how,whence, or why, and we never found out. We woke up one morning andthere she was. By night we were all jealous, and in a week we were mostof us drivelling idiots. It might have been the mystery or, perhaps,the competition. That was the day when a dance-hall girl could make ahomestake in a winter or marry a millionaire in a month, but she neverbothered. She toiled not, neither did she spin on the waxed floors, yetSolomon in all his glory would have looked like a tramp beside her.""You say she is dangerous?""Well, there was the young nobleman, in the winter of '98, Dane, Ithink--fine family and all that--big, yellow-haired boy. He wanted tomarry her, but a faro-dealer shot him. Then there was Rock, of themounted police, the finest officer in the service. He was cashiered.She knew he was going to pot for her, but she didn't seem to care--andthere were others. Yet, with it all, she is the most generous personand the most tender-hearted. Why, she has fed every 'stew bum' on theYukon, and there isn't a busted prospector in the country who wouldn'tswear by her, for she has grubstaked dozens of them. I was horribly inlove with her myself. Yes, she's dangerous, all right--to everybody butGlenister.""What do you mean?""She had been across the Yukon to nurse a man with scurvy, and comingback she was caught in the spring break-up. I wasn't there, but itseems this Glenister got her ashore somehow when nobody else wouldtackle the job. They were carried five miles down-stream in theice-pack before he succeeded.""What happened then?""She fell in love with him, of course.""And he worshipped her as madly as all the rest of you, I suppose," shesaid, scornfully."That's the peculiar part. She hypnotized him at first, but he ranaway, and I didn't hear of him again till I came to Nome. She followedhim, finally, and last week evened up her score. She paid him back forsaving her.""I haven't heard about it."He detailed the story of the gambling episode at the Northern saloon,and concluded: "I'd like to have seen that 'turn,' for they say theexcitement was terrific. She was keeping cases, and at the finishslammed her case-keeper shut and declared the bet off because she hadmade a mistake. Of course they couldn't dispute her, and she stuck toit. One of the by-standers told me she lied, though.""So, in addition to his other vices, Mr. Glenister is a recklessgambler, is he?" said Helen, with heat. "I am proud to be indebted tosuch a character. Truly this country breeds wonderful species.""There's where you're wrong," Struve chuckled. "He's never been knownto bet before.""Oh, I'm tired of these contradictions!" she cried, angrily. "Saloons,gambling-halls, scandals, adventuresses! Ugh! I hate it! I HATE it! Whydid I ever come here?""Those things are a part of every new country. They were about all wehad till this year. But it is women like you that we fellows need, MissHelen. You can help us a lot." She did not like the way he was lookingat her, and remembered that her uncle was up-stairs and asleep."I must ask you to excuse me now, for it's late and I am very tired."The clock showed half-past twelve, so, after letting him out, sheextinguished the light and dragged herself wearily up to her room. Sheremoved her outer garments and threw over her bare shoulders a negligeeof many flounces and bewildering, clinging looseness. As she took downher heavy braids, the story of Cherry Malotte returned to hertormentingly. So Glenister had saved HER life also at risk of his own.What a very gallant cavalier he was, to be sure! He should bear a coatof arms--a dragon, an armed knight, and a fainting maiden. "I succorladies in distress--handsome ones," should be the motto on his shield."The handsomest woman in the North," Struve had said. She raised hereyes to the glass and made a mouth at the petulant, tired reflectionthere. She pictured Glenister leaping from floe to floe with the hungryriver surging and snapping at his feet, while the cheers of the crowdon shore gave heart to the girl crouching out there. She could see himsnatch her up and fight his way back to safety over the plungingice-cakes with death dragging at his heels. What a strong embrace hehad! At this she blushed and realized with a shock that while she wasmooning that very man might be fighting hand to hand in the darkness ofa mountain-gorge with the man she was going to marry.A moment later some one mounted the front steps below and knockedsharply. Truly this was a night of alarms. Would people never ceasecoming? She was worn out, but at the thought of the tragedy abroad andthe sick old man sleeping near by, she lit a candle and slippeddown-stairs to avoid disturbing him. Doubtless it was some message fromMcNamara, she thought, as she unchained the door.As she opened it, she fell back amazed while it swung wide and thecandle flame flickered and sputtered in the night air. Roy Glenisterstood there, grim and determined, his soft, white Stetson pulled low,his trousers tucked into tan half-boots, in his hand a Winchesterrifle. Beneath his corduroy coat she saw a loose cartridge-belt, yellowwith shells, and the nickelled flash of a revolver. Without invitationhe strode across the threshold, closing the door behind him."Miss Chester, you and the Judge must dress quickly and come with me.""I don't understand.""The Vigilantes are on their way here to hang him. Come with me to myhouse where I can protect you."She laid a trembling hand on her bosom and the color died out of herface, then at a slight noise above they both looked up to see JudgeStillman leaning far over the banister. He had wrapped himself in adressing-gown and now gripped the rail convulsively, while his featureswere blanched to the color of putty and his eyes were wide with terror,though puffed and swollen from sleep. His lips moved in a vain endeavorto speak.CHAPTER XVVIGILANTESOn the morning after the episode in the Northern, Glenister awoke undera weight of discouragement and desolation. The past twenty-four hourswith their manifold experiences seemed distant and unreal. At breakfasthe was ashamed to tell Dextry of the gambling debauch, for he had dealttreacherously with the old man in risking half of the mine, even thoughthey had agreed that either might do as he chose with his interest,regardless of the other. It all seemed like a nightmare, those tensemoments when he lay above the receiver's office and felt his belief inthe one woman slipping away, the frenzied thirst which Cherry Malottehad checked, the senseless, unreasoning lust for play that possessedhim later. This lapse was the last stand of his old, untamed instincts.The embers of revolt in him were dead. He felt that he would neveragain lose mastery of himself, that his passions would never best himhereafter.Dextry spoke. "We had a meeting of the 'Stranglers' last night." Healways spoke of the Vigilantes in that way, because of his earlyWestern training."What was done?""They decided to act quick and do any odd jobs of lynchin',claim-jumpin', or such as needs doin'. There's a lot of law sharps andstorekeepers in the bunch who figure McNamara's gang will wipe them offthe map next.""It was bound to come to this.""They talked of ejectin' the receiver's men and puttin' all us fellersback on our mines.""Good. How many can we count on to help us?""About sixty. We've kept the number down, and only taken men with somuch property that they'll have to keep their mouths shut.""I wish we might engineer some kind of an encounter with the courtcrowd and create such an uproar that it would reach Washington.Everything else has failed, and our last chance seems to be for thegovernment to step in; that is, unless Bill Wheaton can do somethingwith the California courts.""I don't count on him. McNamara don't care for California courts nomore 'n he would for a boy with a pea-shooter--he's got too much pullat headquarters. If the 'Stranglers' don't do no good, we'd better goin an' clean out the bunch like we was killin' snakes. If that fails,I'm goin' out to the States an' be a doctor.""A doctor? What for?""I read somewhere that in the United States every year there is fortymillion gallons of whiskey used for medical purposes."Glenister laughed. "Speaking of whiskey, Dex--I notice that you've beendrinking pretty hard of late--that is, hard for you."The old man shook his head. "You're mistaken. It ain't hard for me.""Well, hard or easy, you'd better cut it out."It was some time later that one of the detectives employed by theSwedes met Glenister on Front Street, and by an almost imperceptiblesign signified his desire to speak with him. When they were alone hesaid:"You're being shadowed.""I've known that for a long time.""The district-attorney has put on some new men. I've fixed the womanwho rooms next to him, and through her I've got a line on some of them,but I haven't spotted them all. They're bad ones--'up-river' menmostly--remnants of Soapy Smith's Skagway gang. They won't stop atanything.""Thank you--I'll keep my eyes open."A few nights after, Glenister had reason to recall the words of thesleuth and to realize that the game was growing close and desperate. Toreach his cabin, which sat on the outskirts of the town, he ordinarilyfollowed one of the plank walks which wound through the confusion oftents, warehouses, and cottages lying back of the two principal streetsalong the water front. This part of the city was not laid out inrectangular blocks, for in the early rush the first-comers had seizedwhatever pieces of ground they found vacant and erected thereon somekind of buildings to make good their titles. There resulted a formlessjumble of huts, cabins, and sheds, penetrated by no cross streets andquite unlighted. At night, one leaving the illuminated portion of thetown found this darkness intensified.Glenister knew his course so well that he could have walked itblindfolded. Nearing a corner of the warehouse this evening heremembered that the planking at this point was torn up, so, to avoidthe mud, he leaped lightly across. Simultaneously with his jump hedetected a movement in the shadows that banked the wall at his elbowand saw the flaming spurt of a revolver-shot. The man had crouchedbehind the building and was so close that it seemed impossible to miss.Glenister fell heavily upon his side and the thought flashed over him,"McNamara's thugs have shot me."His assailant leaped out from his hiding-place and ran down the walk,the sound of his quick, soft footfalls thudding faintly out into thesilence. The young man felt no pain, however, so scrambled to his feet,felt himself over with care, and then swore roundly. He was untouched;the other had missed him cleanly. The report, coming while he was inthe act of leaping, had startled him so that he had lost his balance,slipped upon the wet boards, and fallen. His assailant was lost in thedarkness before he could rise. Pursuit was out of the question, so hecontinued homeward, considerably shaken, and related the incident toDextry."You think it was some of McNamara's work, eh?" Dextry inquired when hehad finished."Of course. Didn't the detective warn me to-day?"Dextry shook his head. "It don't seem like the game is that far alongyet. The time is coming when we'll go to the mat with them people, butthey've got the aige on us now, so what could they gain by putting youaway? I don't believe it's them, but whoever it is, you'd better becareful or you'll be got.""Suppose we come home together after this," Roy suggested, and theyarranged to do so, realizing that danger lurked in the dark corners andthat it was in some such lonely spot that the deed would be triedagain. They experienced no trouble for a time, though on nearing theircabin one night the younger man fancied that he saw a shadow glide awayfrom its vicinity and out into the blackness of the tundra, as thoughsome one had stood at his very door waiting for him, then becamefrightened at the two figures approaching. Dextry had not observed it,however, and Glenister was not positive himself, but it served to givehim the uncanny feeling that some determined, unscrupulous force wasbent on his destruction. He determined to go nowhere unarmed.A few evenings later he went home early and was busied in writing whenDextry came in about ten o'clock. The old miner hung up his coat beforespeaking, lit a cigarette, inhaled deeply, then, amid mouthfuls ofsmoke, began:"I had my own toes over the edge to-night. I was mistook for you, whichcompliment I don't aim to have repeated."Glenister questioned him eagerly."We're about the same height an' these hats of ours are alike. Just asI come by that lumber-pile down yonder, a man hopped out an throwed a'gat' under my nose. He was quicker than light, and near blowed myskelp into the next block before he saw who I was; then he dropped hisweepon and said:"'My mistake. Go on.' I accepted his apology.""Could you see who he was?""Sure. Guess.""I can't.""It was the Bronco Kid.""Lord!" ejaculated Glenister. "Do you think he's after me?""He ain't after nobody else, an', take my word for it, it's got nothin'to do with McNamara nor that gamblin' row. He's too game for that.There's some other reason."This was the first mention Dextry had made of the night at the Northern."I don't know why he should have it in for me--I never did him anyfavors," Glenister remarked, cynically."Well, you watch out, anyhow. I'd sooner face McNamara an' all thecrooks he can hire than that gambler."During the next few days Roy undertook to meet the proprietor of theNorthern face to face, but the Kid had vanished completely from hishaunts. He was not in his gambling-hall at night nor on the street byday. The young man was still looking for him on the evening of thedance at the hotel, when he chanced to meet one of the Vigilantes, whoinquired of him:"Aren't you late for the meeting?""What meeting?"After seeing that they were alone, the other stated:"There's an assembly to-night at eleven o'clock. Something important, Ithink. I supposed, of course, you knew about it.""It's strange I wasn't notified," said Roy. "It's probably anoversight. Ill go along with you."Together they crossed the river to the less frequented part of town andknocked at the door of a large, unlighted warehouse, flanked by a highboard fence. The building faced the street, but was enclosed on theother three sides by this ten-foot wall, inside of which were storedlarge quantities of coal and lumber. After some delay they wereadmitted, and, passing down through the dim-lit, high-banked lanes ofmerchandise, came to the rear room, where they were admitted again.This compartment had been fitted up for the warm storage of perishablegoods during the cold weather, and, being without windows, made anideal place for clandestine gatherings.Glenister was astonished to find every man of the organization present,including Dextry, whom he supposed to have gone home an hour since.Evidently a discussion had been in progress, for a chairman waspresiding, and the boxes, kegs, and bales of goods had been shoved backagainst the walls for seats. On these were ranged the threescore men ofthe "Stranglers," their serious faces lighted imperfectly by scatteredlanterns. A certain constraint seized them upon Glenister's entrance;the chairman was embarrassed. It was but momentary, however. Glenisterhimself felt that tragedy was in the air, for it showed in the men'sattitudes and spoke eloquently from their strained faces. He was aboutto question the man next to him when the presiding officer continued:"We will assemble here quietly with our arms at one o'clock. And let mecaution you again not to talk or do anything to scare the birds away."Glenister arose. "I came late, Mr. Chairman, so I missed hearing yourplan. I gather that you're out for business, however, and I want to bein it. May I ask what is on foot?""Certainly. Things have reached such a pass that moderate means areuseless. We have decided to act, and act quickly. We have exhaustedevery legal resource and now we're going to stamp out this gang ofrobbers in our own way. We will get together in an hour, divide intothree groups of twenty men, each with a leader, then go to the housesof McNamara, Stillman, and Voorhees, take them prisoners, and--" Hewaved his hand in a large gesture.Glenister made no answer for a moment, while the crowd watched himintently."You have discussed this fully?" he asked."We have. It has been voted on, and we're unanimous.""My friends, when I stepped into this room just now I felt that Iwasn't wanted. Why, I don't know, because I have had more to do withorganizing this movement than any of you, and because I have sufferedjust as much as the rest. I want to know if I was omitted from thismeeting intentionally.""This is an embarrassing position to put me in," said the chairman,gravely. "But I shall answer as spokesman for these men if they wish.""Yes. Go ahead," said those around the room."We don't question your loyalty, Mr. Glenister, but we didn't ask youto this meeting because we know your attitude--perhaps I'd better saysentiment--regarding Judge Stillman's niece--er--family. It has come tous from various sources that you have been affected to the prejudice ofyour own and your partner's interest. Now, there isn't going to be anysentiment in the affairs of the Vigilantes. We are going to do justice,and we thought the simplest way was to ignore you in this matter andspare all discussion and hard feeling in every quarter.""It's a lie!" shouted the young man, hoarsely. "A damned lie! Youwouldn't let me in for fear I'd kick, eh? Well, you were right. I willkick. You've hinted about my feelings for Miss Chester. Let me tell youthat she is engaged to marry McNamara, and that she's nothing to me.Now, then, let me tell you, further, that you won't break into herhouse and hang her uncle, even if he is a reprobate. No, sir! Thisisn't the time for violence of that sort--we'll win without it. If wecan't, let's fight like men, and not hunt in a pack like wolves. If youwant to do something, put us back on our mines and help us hold them,but, for God's sake, don't descend to assassination and the tactics ofthe Mafia!""We knew you would make that kind of a talk," said the speaker, whilethe rest murmured grudgingly. One of them spoke up."We've talked this over in cold blood, Glenister, and it's a questionof their lives or our liberty. The law don't enter into it.""That's right," echoed another at his elbow. "We can't seize theclaims, because McNamara's got soldiers to back him up. They'd shoot usdown. You ought to be the last one to object."He saw that dispute was futile. Determination was stamped on theirfaces too plainly for mistake, and his argument had no more effect onthem than had the pale rays of the lantern beside him, yet he continued:"I don't deny that McNamara deserves lynching, but Stillman doesn't.He's a weak old man"--some one laughed derisively--"and there's a womanin the house. He's all she has in the world to depend upon, and youwould have to kill her to get at him. If you MUST follow this course,take the others, but leave him alone."They only shook their heads, while several pushed by him even as hespoke. "We're going to distribute our favors equal," said a man as heleft. They were actuated by what they called justice, and he could notsway them. The life and welfare of the North were in their hands, asthey thought, and there was not one to hesitate. Glenister implored thechairman, but the man answered him:"It's too late for further discussion, and let me remind you of yourpromise. You're bound by every obligation that exists for an honorableman--""Oh, don't think that I'll give the snap away!" said the other; "but Iwarn you again not to enter Stillman's house."He followed out into the night to find that Dextry had disappeared,evidently wishing to avoid argument. Roy had seen signs of unrestbeneath the prospector's restraint during the past few days, andindications of a fierce hunger to vent his spleen on the men who hadrobbed him of his most sacred rights. He was of an intolerant,vindictive nature that would go to any length for vengeance.Retribution was part of his creed.On his way home, the young man looked at his watch, to find that he hadbut an hour to determine his course. Instinct prompted him to join hisfriends and to even the score with the men who had injured him sobitterly, for, measured by standards of the frontier, they were pirateswith their lives forfeit. Yet, he could not countenance this step. Ifonly the Vigilantes would be content with making an example--but heknew they would not. The blood hunger of a mob is easy to whet and hardto hold. McNamara would resist, as would Voorhees and thedistrict-attorney, then there would be bloodshed, riot, chaos. Thesoldiers would be called out and martial law declared, the streetswould become skirmish-grounds. The Vigilantes would rout them withoutquestion, for every citizen of the North would rally to their aid, andsuch men could not be stopped. The Judge would go down with the rest ofthe ring, and what would happen to--her?He took down his Winchester, oiled and cleaned it, then buckled on abelt of cartridges. Still he wrestled with himself. He felt that he wasbeing ground between his loyalty to the Vigilantes and his ownconscience. The girl was one of the gang, he reasoned--she had schemedwith them to betray him through his love, and she was pledged to theone man in the world whom he hated with fanatical fury. Why should hethink of her in this hour? Six months back he would have looked withjealous eyes upon the right to lead the Vigilantes, but this changethat had mastered him--what was it? Not cowardice, nor caution. No.Yet, being intangible, it was none the less marked, as his friends hadshown him an hour since.He slipped out into the night. The mob might do as it pleasedelsewhere, but no man should enter her house. He found a light shiningfrom her parlor window, and, noting the shade up a few inches, stoleclose. Peering through, he discovered Struve and Helen talking. Heslunk back into the shadows and remained hidden for a considerable timeafter the lawyer left, for the dancers were returning from the hoteland passed close by. When the last group had chattered away down thestreet, he returned to the front of the house and, mounting the steps,knocked sharply. As Helen appeared at the door, he stepped inside andclosed it after him.The girl's hair lay upon her neck and shoulders in tumbled brownmasses, while her breast heaved tumultuously at the sudden, grim sightof him. She stepped back against the wall, her wondrous, deep, grayeyes wide and troubled, the blush of modesty struggling with the pallorof dismay.The picture pained him like a knife-thrust. This girl was for hisbitterest enemy--no hope of her was for him. He forgot for a momentthat she was false and plotting, then, recalling it, spoke as roughlyas he might and stated his errand. Then the old man had appeared on thestairs above, speechless with fright at what he overheard. It wasevident that his nerves, so sorely strained by the events of the pastweek, were now snapped utterly. A human soul naked and panic-strickenis no pleasant sight, so Glenister dropped his eyes and addressed thegirl again:"Don't take anything with you. Just dress and come with me."The creature on the stairs above stammered and stuttered, inquiringly:"What outrage is this, Mr. Glenister?""The people of Nome are up in arms, and I've come to save you. Don'tstop to argue." He spoke impatiently."Is this some r-ruse to get me into your power?""Uncle Arthur!" exclaimed the girl, sharply. Her eyes met Glenister'sand begged him to take no offence."I don't understand this atrocity. They must be mad!" wailed the Judge."You run over to the jail, Mr. Glenister, and tell Voorhees to hurryguards here to protect me. Helen, 'phone to the military post and givethe alarm. Tell them the soldiers must come at once.""Hold on!" said Glenister. "There's no use of doing that--the wires arecut; and I won't notify Voorhees--he can take care of himself. I cameto help you, and if you want to escape you'll stop talking and hurryup.""I don't know what to do," said Stillman, torn by terror andindecision. "You wouldn't hurt an old man, would you? Wait! I'll bedown in a minute."He scrambled up the stairs, tripping on his robe, seemingly forgettinghis niece till she called up to him, sharply:"Stop, Uncle Arthur! You mustn't RUN AWAY." She stood erect anddetermined, "You wouldn't do THAT, would you? This is our house. Yourepresent the law and the dignity of the government. You mustn't fear amob of ruffians. We will stay here and meet them, of course.""Good Lord!" said Glenister. "That's madness. These men aren'truffians; they are the best citizens of Nome. You don't realize thatthis is Alaska and that they have sworn to wipe out McNamara's gang.Come along.""Thank you for your good intentions," she said, "but we have donenothing to run away from. We will get ready to meet these cowards. Youhad better go or they will find you here."She moved up the stairs, and, taking the Judge by the arm, led him withher. Of a sudden she had assumed control of the situationunfalteringly, and both men felt the impossibility of thwarting her.Pausing at the top, she turned and looked down."We are grateful for your efforts just the same. Good-night.""Oh, I'm not going," said the young man. "If you stick I'll do thesame." He made the rounds of the first-floor rooms, locking doors andwindows. As a place of defence it was hopeless, and he saw that hewould have to make his stand up-stairs. When sufficient time hadelapsed he called up to Helen:"May I come?""Yes," she replied. So he ascended, to find Stillman in the hall, halfclothed and cowering, while by the light from the front chamber he sawher finishing her toilet."Won't you come with me--it's our last chance?" She only shook herhead. "Well, then, put out the light. I'll stand at that front window,and when my eyes get used to the darkness I'll be able to see thembefore they reach the gate."She did as directed, taking her place beside him at the opening, whilethe Judge crept in and sat upon the bed, his heavy breathing the onlysound in the room. The two young people stood so close beside eachother that the sweet scent of her person awoke in him an almostirresistible longing. He forgot her treachery again, forgot that shewas another's, forgot all save that he loved her truly and purely, witha love which was like an agony to him. Her shoulder brushed his arm; heheard the soft rustling of her garment at her breast as she breathed.Some one passed in the street, and she laid a hand upon him fearfully.It was very cold, very tiny, and very soft, but he made no move to takeit. The moments dragged along, still, tense, interminable. Occasionallyshe leaned towards him, and he stooped to catch her whispered words. Atsuch times her breath beat warm against his cheek, and he closed histeeth stubbornly. Out in the night a wolfdog saddened the air, thencame the sound of others wrangling and snarling in a near-by corral.This is a chickless land and no cock-crow breaks the midnight peace.The suspense enhanced the Judge's perturbation till his chatteringteeth sounded like castanets. Now and then he groaned.The watchers had lost track of time when their strained eyes detecteddark blots materializing out of the shadows."There they come," whispered Glenister, forcing her back from theaperture; but she would not be denied, and returned to his side.As the foremost figures reached the gate, Roy leaned forth and spoke,not loudly, but in tones that sliced through the silence, sharp, clean,and without warning."Halt! Don't come inside the fence." There was an instant's confusion;then, before the men beneath had time to answer or take action, hecontinued: "This is Roy Glenister talking. I told you not to molestthese people and I warn you again. We're ready for you."The leader spoke. "You're a traitor, Glenister."He winced. "Perhaps I am. You betrayed me first, though; and, traitoror not, you can't come into this house."There was a murmur at this, and some one said:"Miss Chester is safe. All we want is the Judge. We won't hang him, notif he'll wear this suit we brought along. He needn't be afraid. Tar isgood for the skin.""Oh, my God!" groaned the limb of the law.Suddenly a man came running down the planked pavement and into thegroup."McNamara's gone, and so's the marshal and the rest," he panted. Therewas a moment's silence, and then the leader growled to his men,"Scatter out and rush the house, boys." He raised his voice to the manin the window. "This is your work--you damned turncoat." His followersmelted away to right and left, vaulted the fence, and dodged into theshelter of the walls. The click, click of Glenister's Winchestersounded through the room while the sweat stood out on him. He wonderedif he could do this deed, if he could really fire on these people. Hewondered if his muscles would not wither and paralyze before theyobeyed his command.Helen crowded past him and, leaning half out of the opening, calledloudly, her voice ringing clear and true:"Wait! Wait a moment. I have something to say. Mr. Glenister didn'twarn them. They thought you were going to attack the mines and so theyrode out there before midnight. I am telling you the truth, really.They left hours ago." It was the first sign she had made, and theyrecognized her to a man.There were uncertain mutterings below till a new man raised his voice.Both Roy and Helen recognised Dextry."Boys, we've overplayed. We don't want THESE people--McNamara's ourmeat. Old bald-face up yonder has to do what he's told, and I'm ag'in'this twenty-to-one midnight work. I'm goin' home." There were somewhisperings, then the original spokesman called for Judge Stillman. Theold man tottered to the window, a palsied, terror-stricken object. Thegirl was glad he could not be seen from below."We won't hurt you this time, Judge, but you've gone far enough. We'llgive you another chance, then, if you don't make good, we'll stretchyou to a lamp-post. Take this as a warning.""I--s-shall do my d-d-duty," said the Judge.The men disappeared into the darkness, and when they had gone Glenisterclosed the window, pulled down the shades, and lighted a lamp. He knewby how narrow a margin a tragedy had been averted. If he had fired onthese men his shot would have kindled a feud which would have consumedevery vestige of the court crowd and himself among them. He would havefallen under a false banner, and his life would not have reached to thenext sunset. Perhaps it was forfeit now--he could not tell. TheVigilantes would probably look upon his part as traitorous; and, at thevery least, he had cut himself off from their support, the only supportthe Northland offered him. Henceforth he was a renegade, a pariah,hated alike by both factions. He purposely avoided sight of Stillmanand turned his back when the Judge extended his hand with expressionsof gratitude. His work was done and he wished to leave this house.Helen followed him down to the door and, as he opened it, laid her handupon his sleeve."Words are feeble things, and I can never make amends for all you'vedone for us.""For US!" cried Roy, with a break in his voice. "Do you think Isacrificed my honor, betrayed my friends, killed my last hope,ostracized myself, for 'US'? This is the last time I'll trouble you.Perhaps the last time I'll see you. No matter what else you've done,however, you've taught me a lesson, and I thank you for it. I havefound myself at last. I'm not an Eskimo any longer--I'm a man!""You've always been that," she said. "I don't understand as much aboutthis affair as I want to, and it seems to me that no one will explainit. I'm very stupid, I guess; but won't you come back to-morrow andtell it to me?""No," he said, roughly. "You're not of my people. McNamara and his areno friends of mine, and I'm no friend of theirs." He was half down thesteps before she said, softly:"Good-night, and God bless you--friend."She returned to the Judge, who was in a pitiable state, and for a longtime she labored to soothe him as though he were a child. She undertookto question him about the things which lay uppermost in her mind andwhich this night had half revealed, but he became fretful and irritatedat the mention of mines and mining. She sat beside his bed till hedozed off, puzzling to discover what lay behind the hints she hadheard, till her brain and body matched in absolute weariness. Thereflex of the day's excitement sapped her strength till she couldbarely creep to her own couch, where she rolled and sighed--too tiredto sleep at once. She awoke finally, with one last nervous flicker,before complete oblivion took her. A sentence was on her mind--italmost seemed as though she had spoken it aloud:"The handsomest woman in the North...but Glenister ran away."CHAPTER XVIIN WHICH THE TRUTH BEGINS TO BARE ITSELFIt was nearly noon of the next day when Helen awoke to find thatMcNamara had ridden in from the Creek and stopped for breakfast withthe Judge. He had asked for her, but on hearing the tale of the night'sadventure would not allow her to be disturbed. Later, he and the Judgehad gone away together.Although her judgment approved the step she had contemplated the nightbefore, still the girl now felt a strange reluctance to meet McNamara.It is true that she knew no ill of him, except that implied in theaccusations of certain embittered men; and she was aware that everystrong and aggressive character makes enemies in direct proportionatethe qualities which lend him greatness. Nevertheless, she was aware ofan inner conflict that she had not foreseen. This man who soconfidently believed that she would marry him did not dominate herconsciousness.She had ridden much of late, taking long, solitary gallops beside theshimmering sea that she loved so well, or up the winding valleys intothe foot-hills where echoed the roar of swift waters or glinted theflash of shovel blades. This morning her horse was lame, so shedetermined to walk. In her early rambles she had looked timidly askanceat the rough men she met till she discovered their genuine respect andcourtesy. The most unkempt among them were often college-bred,although, for that matter, the roughest of the miners showed abundantconsideration for a woman. So she was glad to allow the men to talk toher with the fine freedom inspired by the new country and its widespaces. The wilderness breeds a chivalry all its own.Thus there seemed to be no danger abroad, though they had told the girlof mad dogs which roamed the city, explaining that the hot weatheraffects powerfully the thick-coated, shaggy "malamoots." This is theland of the dog, and whereas in winter his lot is to labor and shiverand starve, in summer he loafs, fights, grows fat, and runs mad withthe heat.Helen walked far and, returning, chose an unfamiliar course through theoutskirts of the town to avoid meeting any of the women she knew,because of that vivid memory of the night before. As she walked swiftlyalong she thought that she heard faint cries far behind her. Lookingup, she noted that it was a lonely, barren quarter and that the onlyfigure in sight was a woman some distance away. A few paces farther onthe shouts recurred--more plainly this time, and a gunshot sounded.Glancing back, she saw several men running, one bearing a smokingrevolver, and heard, nearer still, the snarling hubbub of fightingdogs. In a flash the girl's curiosity became horror, for, as shewatched, one of the dogs made a sudden dash through the now subduedgroup of animals and ran swiftly along the planking on which she stood.It was a handsome specimen of the Eskimo malamoot--tall, gray, andcoated like a wolf, with the speed, strength, and cunning of itscousin. Its head hung low and swung from side to side as it trotted,the motion flecking foam and slaver. The creature had scattered thepack, and now, swift, menacing, relentless, was coming towards Helen.There was no shelter near, no fence, no house, save the distant onetowards which the other woman was making her way. The men, too far awayto protect her, shouted hoarse warnings.Helen did not scream nor hesitate--she turned and ran, terror-stricken,towards the distant cottage. She was blind with fright and felt anutter certainty that the dog would attack her before she could reachsafety. Yes--there was the quick patter of his pads close up behindher; her knees weakened; the sheltering door was yet some yards away.But a horse, tethered near the walk, reared and snorted as the flyingpair drew near. The mad creature swerved, leaped at the horse's legs,and snapped in fury. Badly frightened at this attack, the horse lungedat his halter, broke it, and galloped away; but the delay had servedfor Helen, weak and faint, to reach the door. She wrenched at the knob.It was locked. As she turned hopelessly away, she saw that the otherwoman was directly behind her, and was, in her turn, awaiting the madanimal's onslaught, but calmly, a tiny revolver in her hand."Shoot!" screamed Helen. "Why don't you shoot?" The little gun spoke,and the dog spun around, snarling and yelping. The woman fired severaltimes more before it lay still, and then remarked, calmly, as she"broke" the weapon and ejected the shells:"The calibre is too small to be good for much."Helen sank down upon the steps."How well you shoot!" she gasped. Her eyes were on the gray bundlewhose death agonies had thrust it almost to her feet. The men had runup and were talking excitedly, but after a word with them the womanturned to Helen."You must come in for a moment and recover yourself," she said, and ledher inside.It was a cosey room in which the girl found herself--more thanthat--luxurious. There was a piano with scattered music, and many ofthe pretty, feminine things that Helen had not seen since leaving home.The hostess had stepped behind some curtains for an instant and wastalking to her from the next room."That is the third mad dog I have seen this month. Hydrophobia isbecoming a habit in this neighborhood." She returned, bearing a tinysilver tray with decanter and glasses."You're all unstrung, but this brandy will help you--if you don'tobject to a swallow of it. Then come right in here and lie down for amoment and you'll be all right." She spoke with such genuine kindnessand sympathy that Helen flashed a grateful glance at her. She was tall,slender, and with a peculiar undulating suggestion in her movements, asthough she had been bred to the clinging folds of silken garments.Helen watched the charm of her smile, the friendly solicitude of herexpression, and felt her heart warm towards this one kind woman in Nome."You're very good," she answered; "but I'm all right now. I was badlyfrightened. It was wonderful, your saving me." She followed the other'sgraceful motion as she placed her burden on the table, and in doing sogazed squarely at a photograph of Roy Glenister."Oh--!" Helen exclaimed, then paused as it flashed over her who thisgirl was. She looked at her quickly. Yes, probably men would considerthe woman beautiful, with that smile. The revelation came with a shock,and she arose, trying to mask her confusion."Thank you so much for your kindness. I'm quite myself now and I mustgo."Her change of face could not escape the quick perceptions of oneschooled by experience in the slights of her sex. Times without numberCherry Malotte had marked that subtle, scornful change in other women,and reviled herself for heeding it. But in some way this girl's mannerhurt her worst of all. She betrayed no sign, however, save a wideningof the eyes and a certain fixity of smile as she answered:"I wish you would stay until you are rested, Miss--" She paused without-stretched hand."Chester. My name is Helen Chester. I'm Judge Stillman's niece,"hurried the other, in embarrassment.Cherry Malotte withdrew her proffered hand and her face grew hard andhateful."Oh! So you are Miss Chester--and I--saved you!" She laughed harshly.Helen strove for calmness. "I'm sorry you feel that way," she said,coolly. "I appreciate your service to me." She moved towards the door."Wait a moment. I want to talk to you." Then, as Helen paid no heed,the woman burst out, bitterly: "Oh, don't be afraid! I know you arecommitting an unpardonable sin by talking to me, but no one will seeyou, and in your code the crime lies in being discovered. Therefore,you're quite safe. That's what makes me an outcast--I was found out. Iwant you to know, however, that, bad as I am, I'm better than you, forI'm loyal to those that like me, and I don't betray my friends.""I don't pretend to understand you," said Helen, coldly."Oh yes, you do! Don't assume such innocence. Of course it's your role,but you can't play it with me." She stepped in front of her visitor,placing her back against the door, while her face was bitter andmocking. "The little service I did you just now entitles me to aprivilege, I suppose, and I'm going to take advantage of it to tell youhow badly your mask fits. Dreadfully rude of me, isn't it? You're inwith a fine lot of crooks, and I admire the way you've done your shareof the dirty work, but when you assume these scandalized, supervirtuousairs it offends me.""Let me out!""I've done bad things," Cherry continued, unheedingly, "but I wasforced into them, usually, and I never, deliberately, tried to wreck aman's life just for his money.""What do you mean by saying that I have betrayed my friends and wreckedanybody's life?" Helen demanded, hotly."Bah! I had you sized up at the start, but Roy couldn't see it. ThenStruve told me what I hadn't guessed. A bottle of wine, a woman, andthat fool will tell all he knows. It's a great game McNamara's playingand he did well to get you in on it, for you're clever, your nerve isgood, and your make-up is great for the part. I ought to know, for I'veturned a few tricks myself. You'll pardon this little burst offeeling--professional pique. I'm jealous of your ability, that's all.However, now that you realize we're in the same class, don't look downon me hereafter." She opened the door and bowed her guest out withelaborate mockery.Helen was too bewildered and humiliated to make much out of thisvicious and incoherent attack except the fact that Cherry Malotteaccused her of a part in this conspiracy which every one seemed tobelieve existed. Here again was that hint of corruption which sheencountered on all sides. This might be merely a woman's jealousy--andyet she said Struve had told her all about it--that a bottle of wineand a pretty face would make the lawyer disclose everything. She couldbelieve it from what she knew and had heard of him. The feeling thatshe was groping in the dark, that she was wrapped in a mysterious woofof secrecy, came over her again as it had so often of late. If Struvetalked to that other woman, why wouldn't he talk to her? She paused,changing her direction towards Front Street, revolving rapidly in hermind as she went her course of action. Cherry Malotte believed her tobe an actress. Very well--she would prove her judgment right.She found Struve busy in his private office, but he leaped to his feeton her entrance and came forward, offering her a chair."Good-morning, Miss Helen. You have a fine color, considering the nightyou passed. The Judge told me all about the affair; and let me statethat you're the pluckiest girl I know."She smiled grimly at the thought of what made her cheeks glow, andlanguidly loosened the buttons of her jacket."I suppose you're very busy, you lawyer man?" she inquired."Yes--but not too busy to attend to anything you want.""Oh, I didn't come on business," she said, lightly. "I was out walkingand merely sauntered in.""Well, I appreciate that all the more," he said, in an altered tone,twisting his chair about. "I'm more than delighted." She judged she wasgetting on well from the way his professionalism had dropped off."Yes, I get tired of talking to uncle and Mr. McNamara. They treat meas though I were a little girl.""When do you take the fatal step?""What step do you mean?""Your marriage. When does it occur? You needn't hesitate," he added."McNamara told we about it a month ago."He felt his throat gingerly at the thought, but his eyes brightenedwhen she answered, lightly:"I think you are mistaken. He must have been joking."For some time she led him on adroitly, talking of many things, in a wayto make him wonder at her new and flippant humor. He had never dreamedshe could be like this, so tantalizingly close to familiarity, and yetso maddeningly aloof and distant. He grew bolder in his speech."How are things going with us?" she questioned, as his warmth grewpronounced. "Uncle won't talk and Mr. McNamara is as close-mouthed ascan be, lately."He looked at her quickly. "In what respect?"She summoned up her courage and walked past the ragged edge ofuncertainty."Now, don't you try to keep me in short dresses, too. It's gettingwearisome. I've done my part and I want to know what the rest of youare doing." She was prepared for any answer."What do you want to know?" he asked, cautiously."Everything. Don't you think I can hear what people are saying?""Oh, that's it! Well, don't you pay any attention to what people say."She recognized her mistake and continued, hurriedly:"Why shouldn't I? Aren't we all in this together? I object to beingused and then discarded. I think I'm entitled to know how the scheme isworking. Don't you think I can keep my mouth shut?""Of course," he laughed, trying to change the subject of their talk;but she arose and leaned against the desk near him, vowing that shewould not leave the office without piercing some part of this mystery.His manner strengthened her suspicion that there WAS something behindit all. This dissipated, brilliant creature knew the situationthoroughly; and yet, though swayed by her efforts, he remained chainedby caution. She leaned forward and smiled at him."You're just like the others, aren't you? You won't give me anysatisfaction at all.""Give, give, give," said Struve, cynically. "That's always the woman'scry. Give me this--give me that. Selfish sex! Why don't you offersomething in return? Men are traders, women usurers. You are curious,hence miserable. I can help you, therefore I should, do it for a smile.You ask me to break my promises and risk my honor on your caprice.Well, that's woman-like, and I'll do it. I'll put myself in your power,but I won't do it gratis. No, we'll trade.""It isn't curiosity," she denied, indignantly. "It is my due.""No; you've heard the common talk and grown suspicious, that's all. Youthink I know something that will throw a new light or a new shadow oneverything you have in the world, and you're worked up to such acondition that you can't take your own people's word; and, on the otherhand, you can't go to strangers, so you come to me. Suppose I told youI had the papers you brought to me last spring in that safe and thatthey told the whole story--whether your uncle is unimpeachable orwhether he deserved hanging by that mob. What would you do, eh? Whatwould you give to see them? Well, they're there and ready to speak forthemselves. If you're a woman you won't rest till you've seen them.Will you trade?""Yes, yes! Give them to me," she cried, eagerly, at which a wave ofcrimson rushed up to his eyes and he rose abruptly from his chair. Hemade towards her, but she retreated to the wall, pale and wide-eyed."Can't you see," she flung at him, "that I MUST know?"He paused. "Of course I can, but I want a kiss to bind the bargain--toapply on account." He reached for her hand with his own hot one, butshe pushed him away and slipped past him towards the door."Suit yourself," said he, "but if I'm not mistaken, you'll never resttill you've seen those papers. I've studied you, and I'll place a betthat you can't marry McNamara nor look your uncle in the eye till youknow the truth. You might do either if you KNEW them to be crooks, butyou couldn't if you only suspected it--that's the woman. When you getready, come back; I'll show you proof, because I don't claim to beanything but what I am--Wilton Struve, bargainer of some mean ability.When they come to inscribe my headstone I hope they can carve thereonwith truth, 'He got value received.'""You're a panther," she said, loathingly."Graceful and elegant brute, that," he laughed. "Affectionate and fullof play, but with sharp teeth and sharper claws. To follow out theidea, which pleases me, I believe the creature owes no loyalty to itsfellows and hunts alone. Now, when you've followed this conspiracy outand placed the blame where it belongs, won't you come and tell me aboutit? That door leads into an outer hall which opens into the street. Noone will see you come or go."As she hurried away she wondered dazedly why she had stayed to listenso long. What a monster he was! His meaning was plain, had always beenso from the first day he laid eyes upon her, and he was utterlyconscienceless. She had known all this; and yet, in her proud, youthfulconfidence, and in her need, every hour more desperate and urgent, toknow the truth, she had dared risk herself with him. Withal, the manwas shrewd and observant and had divined her mental condition withremarkable sagacity. She had failed with him; but the girl now knewthat she could never rest till she found an answer to her questions.She MUST kill this suspicion that ate into her so. She thought tenderlyof her uncle's goodness to her, clung with despairing faith to the lastof her kin. The blood ties of the Chesters were close and she felt indire need of that lost brother who was somewhere in this mysteriousland--need of some one in whom ran the strain that bound her to theweak old man up yonder. There was McNamara; but how could he help her,how much did she know of him, this man who was now within the darkestshadow of her new suspicions?Feeling almost intolerably friendless and alone, weakened both by herrecent fright and by her encounter with Struve, Helen considered ascalmly as her emotions would allow and decided that this was no day inwhich pride should figure. There were facts which it was imperative sheshould know, and immediately; therefore, a few minutes later, sheknocked at the door of Cherry Malotte. When the girl appeared, Helenwas astonished to see that she had been crying. Tears burn hottest andleave plainest trace in eyes where they come most seldom. The youngergirl could not guess the tumult of emotion the other had undergoneduring her absence, the utter depths of self-abasement she hadfathomed, for the sight of Helen and her fresh young beauty had rousedin the adventuress a very tempest of bitterness and jealousy. WhetherHelen Chester were guilty or innocent, how could Glenister hesitatebetween them? Cherry had asked herself. Now she stared at her visitorinhospitably and without sign."Will you let me come in?" Helen asked her. "I have something to say toyou."When they were inside, Cherry Malotte stood and gazed at her visitorwith inscrutable eyes and stony face."It isn't easy for me to come back," Helen began, "but I felt that Ihad to. If you can help me, I hope you will. You said that you knew agreat wrong was being done. I have suspected it, but I didn't know, andI've been afraid to doubt my own people. You said I had a part init--that I'd betrayed my friends. Wait a moment," she hurried on, atthe other's cynical smile. "Won't you tell me what you know and whatyou think my part has been? I've heard and seen things that make methink--oh, they make me afraid to think, and yet I can't find theTRUTH! You see, in a struggle like this, people will make all sorts ofallegations, but do they KNOW, have they any proof, that my uncle hasdone wrong?""Is that all?""No. You said Struve told you the whole scheme. I went to him and triedto cajole the story out of him, but--" She shivered at the memory."What success did you have?" inquired the listener, oddly curious forall her cold dislike."Don't ask me. I hate to think of it."Cherry laughed cruelly. "So, failing there, you came back to me, backfor another favor from the waif. Well, Miss Helen Chester, I don'tbelieve a word you've said and I'll tell you nothing. Go back to theuncle and the rawboned lover who sent you, and inform them that I'llspeak when the time comes. They think I know too much, do they?--sothey've sent you to spy? Well, I'll make a compact. You play your gameand I'll play mine. Leave Glenister alone and I'll not tell onMcNamara. Is it a bargain?""No, no, no! Can't you SEE? That's not it. All I want is the truth ofthis thing.""Then go back to Struve and get it. He'll tell you; I won't. Drive yourbargain with him--you're able. You've fooled better men--now, see whatyou can do with him."Helen left, realizing the futility of further effort, though she feltthat this woman did not really doubt her, but was scourged by jealousytill she deliberately chose this attitude.Reaching her own house, she wrote two brief notes and called in her Japboy from the kitchen."Fred, I want you to hunt up Mr. Glenister and give him this note. Ifyou can't find him, then look for his partner and give the other tohim." Fred vanished, to return in an hour with the letter for Dextrystill in his hand."I don' catch dis feller," he explained. "Young mans say he gone, comeback mebbe one, two, 'leven days.""Did you deliver the one to Mr. Glenister?""Yes, ma'am.""Was there an answer?""Yes, ma'am.""Well, give it to me."The note read:"DEAR MISS CHESTER,--A discussion of a matter so familiar to us both asthe Anvil Creek controversy would be useless. If your inclination isdue to the incidents of last night, pray don't trouble yourself. Wedon't want your pity. I am, "Your servant,  "ROY GLENISTER."As she read the note, Judge Stillman entered, and it seemed to the girlthat he had aged a year for every hour in the last twelve, or else theyellow afternoon light limned the sagging hollows and haggard lines ofhis face most pitilessly. He showed in voice and manner the nervousburden under which he labored."Alec has told me about your engagement, and it lifts a terrible loadfrom me. I'm mighty glad you're going to marry him. He's a wonderfulman, and he's the only one who can save us.""What do you mean by that? What are we in danger of?" she inquired,avoiding discussion of McNamara's announcement."Why, that mob, of course. They'll come back. They said so. But Aleccan handle the commanding officer at the post, and, thanks to him,we'll have soldiers guarding the house hereafter.""Why--they won't hurt us--""Tut, tut! I know what I'm talking about. We're in worse danger nowthan ever, and if we don't break up those Vigilantes there'll bebloodshed--that's what. They're a menace, and they're trying to forceme off the bench so they can take the law into their own hands again.That's what I want to see you about. They're planning to kill Alec andme--so he says--and we've got to act quick to prevent murder. Now, thisyoung Glenister is one of them, and he knows who the rest are. Do youthink you could get him to talk?""I don't think I quite understand you," said the girl, throughwhitening lips."Oh yes, you do. I want the names of the ring-leaders, so that I canjail them. You can worm it out of that fellow if you try."Helen looked at the old man in a horror that at first was dumb. "Youask this of me?" she demanded, hoarsely, at last."Nonsense," he said, irritably. "This isn't any time for sillyscruples. It's life or death for me, maybe, and for Alec, too." He saidthe last craftily, but she stormed at him:"It's infamous! You're asking me to betray the very man who saved usnot twelve hours ago. He risked his life for us.""It isn't treachery at all, it's protection. If we don't get them,they'll get us. I wouldn't punish that young fellow, but I want theothers. Come, now, you've got to do it."But she said "No" firmly, and quietly went to her own room, where,behind the locked door, she sat for a long time staring with unseeingeyes, her hands tight clenched in her lap. At last she whispered:"I'm afraid it's true. I'm afraid it's true."She remained hidden during the dinner-hour, and pleaded a headache whenMcNamara called in the early evening. Although she had not seen himsince he left her the night before, bearing her tacit promise to wedhim, yet how could she meet him now with the conviction growing on herhourly that he was a master-rogue? She wrestled with the thought thathe and her uncle, her own uncle who stood in the place of a father,were conspirators. And yet, at memory of the Judge's cold-bloodedrequest that she should turn traitress, her whole being was revolted.If he could ask a thing like that, what other heartless, selfish actmight he not be capable of? All the long, solitary evening she kept herroom, but at last, feeling faint, slipped down-stairs in search ofFred, for she had eaten nothing since her late breakfast.Voices reached her from the parlor, and as she came to the last stepshe froze there in an attitude of listening. The first sentence sheheard through the close-drawn curtains banished all qualms ateavesdropping. She stood for many breathless minutes drinking in theplot that came to her plainly from within, then turned, gathered up herskirts, and tiptoed back to her room. Here she made haste madly,tearing off her house clothes and donning others.She pressed her face to the window and noted that the night was like aclose-hung velvet pall, without a star in sight. Nevertheless, shewound a heavy veil about her hat and face before she extinguished thelight and stepped into the hall. Hearing McNamara's "Good-night" at thefront-door, she retreated again while her uncle slowly mounted thestairs and paused before her chamber. He called her name softly, butwhen she did not answer continued on to his own room. When he wassafely within she descended quietly, went out, and locked thefront-door behind her, placing the key in her bosom. She hurried now,feeling her way through the thick gloom in a panic, while in her mindwas but one frightened thought: "I'll be too late. I'll be too late."CHAPTER XVIITHE DRIP OF WATER IN THE DARKEven after Helen had been out for some time she could barely seesufficiently to avoid collisions. The air, weighted by a low-hung roofof clouds, was surcharged with the electric suspense of an impendingstorm, and seemed to sigh and tremble at the hint of power in leash. Itwas that pause before the conflict wherein the night laid finger uponits lips.As the girl neared Glenister's cabin she was disappointed at seeing nolight there. She stumbled towards the door, only to utter ahalf-strangled cry as two men stepped out of the gloom and seized herroughly. Something cold and hard was thrust violently against hercheek, forcing her head back and bruising her. She struggled and criedout."Hold on--it's a woman!" ejaculated the man who had pinioned her arms,loosing his hold till only a hand remained on her shoulder. The otherlowered the weapon he had jammed to her face and peered closely."Why, Miss Chester," he said. "What are you doing here? You came neargetting hurt.""I am bound for the Wilsons', but I must have lost my way in thedarkness. I think you have cut my face." She controlled her frightfirmly."That's too bad," one said. "We mistook you for--" And the other brokein, sharply, "You'd better run along. We're waiting for some one."Helen hastened back by the route she had come, knowing that there wasstill time, and that as yet her uncle's emissaries had not laid handsupon Glenister. She had overheard the Judge and McNamara plotting todrag the town with a force of deputies, seizing not only her twofriends, but every man suspected of being a Vigilante. The victims wereto be jailed without bond, without reason, without justice, while themechanism of the court was to be juggled in order to hold them untilfall, if necessary. They had said that the officers were already busy,so haste was a crying thing. She sped down the dark streets towards thehouse of Cherry Malotte, but found no light nor answer to her knock.She was distracted now, and knew not where to seek next among thethousand spots which might hide the man she wanted. What chance had sheagainst the posse sweeping the town from end to end? There was onlyone; he might be at the Northern Theatre. Even so, she could not reachhim, for she dared not go there herself. She thought of Fred, her Japboy, but there was no time. Wasted moments meant failure.Roy had once told her that he never gave up what he undertook. Verywell, she would show that even a girl may possess determination. Thiswas no time for modesty or shrinking indecision, so she pulled the veilmore closely about her face and took her good name into her hands. Shemade rapidly towards the lighted streets which cast a skyward glare,and from which, through the breathless calm, arose the sound ofcarousal. Swiftly she threaded the narrow alleys in search of thetheatre's rear entrance, for she dared not approach from the front. Inthis way she came into a part of the camp which had lain hidden fromher until now, and of the existence of which she had never dreamed.The vices of a city, however horrible, are at least draped scantily bythe mantle of convention, but in a great mining-camp they stand nakedand without concealment. Here there were rows upon rows of crib-likehouses clustered over tortuous, ill-lighted lanes, like blow-fliesswarming to an unclean feast. From within came the noise of ribaldryand debauch. Shrill laughter mingled with coarse, maudlin songs, tillthe clinging night reeked with abominable revelry. The girl saw paintedcreatures of every nationality leaning from windows or beckoning fromdoorways, while drunken men collided with her, barred her course,challenged her, and again and again she was forced to slip from theirembraces. At last the high bulk of the theatre building loomed a shortdistance ahead. Panting and frightened, she tried the door with weakhands, to find it locked. From behind it rose the blare of brass andthe sound of singing. She accosted a man who approached her through thenarrow alley, but he had cruised from the charted course in search ofadventure and was not minded to go in quest of doormen; rather, hechose to sing a chantey, to the bibulous measures of which he invitedher to dance with him, so she slipped away till he had teetered past.He was some longshoreman in that particular epoch of his inebrietywhere life had no burden save the dissipation of wages.Returning, she pounded on the door, possessed of the sense that the manshe sought was here, till at last it was flung open, framing thesilhouette of a shirt-sleeved, thick-set youth, who shouted:"What 'n 'ell do you want to butt in for while the show's on? Go roundfront." She caught a glimpse of disordered scenery, and before he couldslam the door in her face thrust a silver dollar into his hand, at thesame time wedging herself into the opening. He pocketed the coin andthe door clicked to behind her."Well, speak up. The act's closin'." Evidently he was the directinggenius of the performance, for at that moment the chorus broke intofull cry, and he said, hurriedly:"Wait a minute. There goes the finally," and dashed away to tend hisdrops and switches. When the curtain was down and the principals hadsought their dressing-rooms he returned."Do you know Mr. Glenister?" she asked."Sure. I seen him to-night. Come here." He led her towards thefootlights, and, pulling back the edge of the curtain, allowed her topeep past him out into the dance-hall. She had never pictured a placelike this, and in spite of her agitation was astonished at its gaudyelegance. The gallery was formed of a continuous row of compartmentswith curtained fronts, in which men and women were talking, drinking,singing. The seats on the lower floor were disappearing, and the canvascover was rolling back, showing the polished hardwood underneath, whileout through the wide folding-doors that led to the main gambling-roomshe heard a brass-lunged man calling the commencement of the dance.Couples glided into motion while she watched."I don't see him," said her guide. "You better walk out front and helpyourself." He indicated the stairs which led up to the galleried boxesand the steps leading down on to the main floor, but she handed himanother coin, begging him to find Glenister and bring him to her."Hurry; hurry!" she implored.The stage-manager gazed at her curiously, remarking, "My! You spendyour money like it had been left to you. You're a regular pie-check forme. Come around any time."She withdrew to a dark corner and waited interminably till hermessenger appeared at the head of the gallery stairs and beckoned toher. As she drew near he said, "I told him there was a thousand-dollarfilly flaggin' him from the stage door, but he's got a grouch an' won'tstir. He's in number seven." She hesitated, at which he said, "Goon--you're in right;" then continued, reassuringly: "Say, pal, if he'syour white-haired lad, you needn't start no roughhouse, 'cause he don'tflirt wit' these dames none whatever. Naw! Take it from me."She entered the door her counsellor indicated to find Roy lounging backwatching the dancers. He turned inquiringly--then, as she raised herveil, leaped to his feet and jerked the curtains to."Helen! What are you doing here?""You must go away quickly," she gasped. "They're trying to arrest you.""They! Who? Arrest me for what?""Voorhees and his men--for riot, or something about last night.""Nonsense," he said. "I had no part in it. You know that.""Yes, yes--but you're a Vigilante, and they're after you and all yourfriends. Your house is guarded and the town is alive with deputies.They've planned to jail you on some pretext or other and hold youindefinitely. Please go before it's too late.""How do you know this?" he asked, gravely."I overheard them plotting.""Who?""Uncle Arthur and Mr. McNamara." She faced him squarely as she said it,and therefore saw the light flame up in his eyes as he cried:"And you came here to save me--came HERE at the risk of your good name?""Of course. I would have done the same for Dextry." The gladness diedaway, leaving him listless."Well, let them come. I'm done, I guess. I heard from Wheaton to-night.He's down and out, too--some trouble with the 'Frisco courts aboutjurisdiction over these cases. I don't know that it's worth while tofight any longer.""Listen," she said. "You must go. I am sure there is a terrible wrongbeing done, and you and I must stop it. I have seen the truth at last,and you're in the right. Please hide for a time at least.""Very well. If you have taken sides with us there's some hope left.Thank you for the risk you ran in warning me."She had moved to the front of the compartment and was peering forthbetween the draperies when she stifled a cry."Too late! Too late! There they are. Don't part the curtains. They'llsee you."Pushing through the gambling-hall were Voorhees and four others,seemingly in quest of some one."Run down the back stairs," she breathed, and pushed him through thedoor. He caught and held her hand with a last word of gratitude. Thenhe was gone. She drew down her veil and was about to follow when thedoor opened and he reappeared."No use," he remarked, quietly. "There are three more waiting at thefoot." He looked out to find that the officers had searched the crowdand were turning towards the front stairs, thus cutting off hisretreat. There were but two ways down from the gallery and no outsidewindows from which to leap. As they had made no armed display, thepresence of the officers had not interrupted the dance.Glenister drew his revolver, while into his eyes came the dancingglitter that Helen had seen before, cold as the glint of wintersunlight."No, not that--for God's sake!" she shuddered, clasping his arm."I must for your sake, or they'll find you here, and that's worse thanruin. I'll fight it out in the corridors so that you can escape in theconfusion. Wait till the firing stops and the crowd gathers." His handwas on the knob when she tore it loose, whispering hoarsely:"They'll kill you. Wait! There's a better way. Jump." She dragged himto the front of the box and pulled aside the curtains. "It isn't highand they won't see you till it's too late. Then you can run through thecrowd." He grasped her idea, and, slipping his weapon back into itsholster, laid hold of the ledge before him and lowered himself downover the dancers. He swung out unhesitatingly, and almost before he hadbeen observed had dropped into their midst. The gallery was but twicethe height of a man's head from the floor, so he landed on his feet andhad drawn his Colts even while the men at the stairs were shouting athim to halt.At sight of the naked weapons there was confusion, wherein the commandsof the deputies mingled with the shrieks of the women, the crash ofoverturned chairs, and the sound of tramping feet, as the crowd dividedbefore Glenister and swept back against the wall in the same ominousway that a crowd in the street had once divided on the morning ofHelen's arrival. The trombone player, who had sunk low in his chairwith closed eyes, looked out suddenly at the disturbance, and his alarmwas blown through the horn in a startled squawk. A large womanwhimpered, "Don't shoot," and thrust her palms to her ears, closing hereyes tightly.Glenister covered the deputies, from whose vicinity the by-standerssurged as though from the presence of lepers."Hands up!" he cried, sharply, and they froze into motionlessattitudes, one poised on the lowest step of the stairs, the other apace forward. Voorhees appeared at the head of the flight and rusheddown a few steps only to come abruptly into range and to assume a likerigidity, for the young man's aim shifted to him."I have a warrant for you," the officer cried, his voice loud in thehush."Keep it," said Glenister, showing his teeth in a smile in which therewas no mirth. He backed diagonally across the hall, his boot-heelsclicking in the silence, his eyes shifting rapidly up and down thestairs where the danger lay.From her station Helen could see the whole tableau, all but the men onthe stairs, where her vision was cut off. She saw the dance girlscrouched behind their partners or leaning far out from the wall withparted lips, the men eager yet fearful, the bartender with ahalf-polished glass poised high. Then a quick movement across the hallsuddenly diverted her absorbed attention. She saw a man rip aside thedrapery of the box opposite and lean so far out that he seemed in perilof falling. He undertook to sight a weapon at Glenister, who was justpassing from his view. At her first glance Helen gasped--her heart gaveone fierce lunge, and she cried out.The distance across the pit was so short that she saw his every lineand lineament clearly; it was the brother she had sought these yearsand years. Before she knew or could check it the blood call leapedforth."Drury!" she cried, aloud, at which he whipped his head about, whileamazement and some other emotion she could not gauge spread slowly overhis features. For a long moment he stared at her without movement orsign while the drama beneath went on, then he drew back into hisretreat with the dazed look of one doubting his senses, yet fearful ofputting them to the test. For her part, she saw nothing except herbrother vanishing slowly into the shadows as though stricken at herglance, the curtains closing before his livid face--and thenpandemonium broke loose at her feet.Glenister, holding his enemies at bay, had retreated to the doubledoors leading to the theatre. His coup had been executed so quickly andwith such lack of turmoil that the throng outside knew nothing of ittill they saw a man walk backward through the door. As he did so hereached forth and slammed the wide wings shut before his face, thenturned and dashed into the press. Inside the dance-hall loud soundsarose as the officers clattered down the stairs and made after theirquarry. They tore the barrier apart in time to see, far down thesaloon, an eddying swirl as though some great fish were lashing throughthe lily-pads of a pond, and then the swinging doors closed behindGlenister.Helen made her way from the theatre as she had come, unobserved andunobserving, but she walked in a dream. Emotions had chased each othertoo closely to-night to be distinguishable, so she went mechanicallythrough the narrow alley to Front Street and thence to her home.Glenister, meanwhile, had been swallowed up by the darkness, the nightenfolding him without sign or trace. As he ran he considered whatcourse to follow--whether to carry the call to his comrades in town orto make for the Creek and Dextry. The Vigilantes might still distrusthim, and yet he owed them warning. McNamara's men were moving soswiftly that action must be speedy to forestall them. Another hour andthe net would be closed, while it seemed that whichever course he chosethey would snare one or the other--either the friends who remained intown, or Dex and Slapjack out in the hills. With daylight those twowould return and walk unheeding into the trap, while if he bore theword to them first, then the Vigilantes would be jailed before dawn. Ashe drew near Cherry Malotte's house he saw a light through the drawncurtains. A heavy raindrop plashed upon his face, another followed, andthen he heard the patter of falling water increasing swiftly. Before hecould gain the door the storm had broken. It swept up the street withtropical violence, while a breath sighed out of the night, lifting thelitter from underfoot and pelting him with flying particles. Over theroofs the wind rushed with the rising moan of a hurricane while thenight grew suddenly noisy ahead of the tempest.He entered the door without knocking, to find the girl removing hercoat. Her face gladdened at sight of him, but he checked her with quickand cautious words, his speech almost drowned by the roar outside."Are you alone?" She nodded, and he slipped the bolt behind him, saying:"The marshals are after me. We just had a 'run in' at the Northern, andI'm on the go. No--nothing serious yet, but they want the Vigilantes,and I must get them word. Will you help me?" He rapidly recounted therow of the last ten minutes while she nodded her quick understanding."You're safe here for a little while," she told him, "for the stormwill check them. If they should come, there's a back door leading outfrom the kitchen and a side entrance yonder. In my room you'll find aFrench window. They can't corner you very well.""Slapjack and Dex are out at the shaft house--you know--that quartzclaim on the mountain above the Midas." He hesitated. "Will you lend meyour saddle-horse? It's a black night and I may kill him.""What about these men in town?""I'll warn them first, then hit for the hills."She shook her head. "You can't do it. You can't get out there beforedaylight if you wait to rouse these people, and McNamara has probablytelephoned the mines to send a party up to the quartz claim after Dex.He knows where the old man is as well as you do, and they'll raid himbefore dawn.""I'm afraid so, but it's all I can offer. Will you give me the horse?""No! He's only a pony, and you'd founder him in the tundra. The mud isknee-deep. I'll go myself.""Good Heavens, girl, in such a night! Why, it's worth your life! Listento it! The creeks will be up and you'll have to swim. No, I can't letyou.""He's a good little horse, and he'll take me through." Then, comingclose, she continued: "Oh, boy! Can't you see that I want to help?Can't you see that I--I'd DIE for you if it would do any good?" Hegazed gravely into her wide blue eyes and said, awkwardly: "Yes, Iknow. I'm sorry things are--as they are--but you wouldn't have me lieto you, little woman?""No. You're the only true man I ever knew. I guess that's why I loveyou. And I do love you, oh, so much! I want to be good and worthy tolove you, too."She laid her face against his arm and caressed him with clingingtenderness, while the wind yelled loudly about the eaves and thewindows drummed beneath the rain. His heavy brows knit themselvestogether as she whispered:"I love you! I love you! I love you!" with such an agony of longing inher voice that her soft accents were sharply distinguishable above theturmoil. The growing wildness seemed a part of the woman's passion,which whipped and harried her like a willow in a blast."Things are fearfully jumbled," he said, finally. "And this is a badtime to talk about them. I wish they might be different. No other girlwould do what you have offered to-night.""Then why do you think of that woman?" she broke in, fiercely. "She'sbad and false. She betrayed you once; she's in the play now; you'vetold me so yourself. Why don't you be a man and forget her?""I can't," he said, simply. "You're wrong, though, when you think she'sbad. I found to-night that she's good and brave and honest. The partshe played was played innocently, I'm sure of that, in spite of thefact that she'll marry McNamara. It was she who overheard them plottingand risked her reputation to warn me."Cherry's face whitened, while the shadowy eagerness that had restedthere died utterly. "She came into that dive alone? She did that?" Henodded, at which she stood thinking for some time, then continued:"You're honest with me, Roy, and I'll be the same with you. I'm tiredof deceit, tired of everything. I tried to make you think she was bad,but in my own heart I knew differently all the time. She came hereto-day and humbled herself to get the truth, humbled herself to me, andI sent her away. She suspected, but she didn't know, and when she askedfor information I insulted her. That's the kind of a creature I am. Isent her back to Struve, who offered to tell her the whole story.""What does that renegade want?""Can't you guess?""Why, I'd rather--" The young man ground his teeth, but Cherry hastened."You needn't worry; she won't see him again. She loathes the ground hewalks on.""And yet he's no worse than that other scoundrel. Come, girl, we havework to do; we must act, and act quickly." He gave her his message toDextry, then she went to her room and slipped into a riding-habit. Whenshe came out he asked: "Where is your raincoat? You'll be drenched inno time.""I can't ride with it. I'll be thrown, anyway, and I don't want to beall bound up. Water won't hurt me."She thrust her tiny revolver into her dress, but he took it and uponexamination shook his head."If you need a gun you'll need a good one." He removed the belt fromhis own waist and buckled his Colts about her."But you!" she objected."I'll get another in ten minutes." Then, as they were leaving, he said:"One other request, Cherry. I'll be in hiding for a time, and I mustget word to Miss Chester to keep watch of her uncle, for the big fightis on at last and the boys will hang him sure if they catch him. I oweher this last warning. Will you send it to her?""I'll do it for your sake, not for her--no, no; I don't mean that. I'lldo the right thing all round. Leave it here and I'll see that she getsit to-morrow. And--Roy--be careful of yourself." Her eyes were starryand in their depths lurked neither selfishness nor jealousy now, onlythat mysterious glory of a woman who makes sacrifice.Together they scurried back to the stable, and yet, in that shortdistance, she would have been swept from her feet had he not seizedher. They blew in through the barn door, streaming and soaked by theblinding sheets that drove scythe-like ahead of the wind. He struck alight, and the pony whinnied at recognition of his mistress. Shestroked the little fellow's muzzle while Glenister cinched on hersaddle. Then, when she was at last mounted, she leaned forward:"Will you kiss me once, Roy, for the last time?"He took her rain-wet face between his hands and kissed her upon thelips as he would have saluted a little maid. As he did so, unseen byboth of them, a face was pressed for an instant against the pane ofglass in the stable wall."You're a brave girl and may God bless you," he said, extinguishing thelight. He flung the door wide and she rode out into the storm. Lockingthe portal, he plunged back towards the house to write his hurriednote, for there was much to do and scant time for its accomplishment,despite the helping hand of the hurricane. He heard the voice of Beringas it thundered on the Golden Sands, and knew that the first greatstorm of the fall had come. Henceforth he saw that the violence of menwould rival the rising elements, for the deeds of this night would stirtheir passions as AEolus was rousing the hate of the sea.He neglected to bolt the house door as he entered, but flung off hisdripping coat and, seizing pad and pencil, scrawled his message. Thewind screamed about the cabin, the lamp flared smokily, and Glenisterfelt a draught suck past him as though from an open door at his back ashe wrote:"I can't do anything more. The end has come and it has brought thehatred and bloodshed that I have been trying to prevent. I played thegame according to your rules, but they forced me back to firstprinciples in spite of myself, and now I don't know what the finishwill be. To-morrow will tell. Take care of your uncle, and if youshould wish to communicate with me, go to Cherry Malotte. She is afriend to both of us. "Always your servant, ROY GLENISTER."As he sealed this he paused, while he felt the hair on his neck riseand bristle and a chill race up his spine. His heart fluttered, thenpounded onward till the blood thumped audibly at his ear-drums and hefound himself swaying in rhythm to its beat. The muscles of his backcringed and rippled at the proximity of some hovering peril, and yet anirresistible feeling forbade him to turn. A sound came from closebehind his chair--the drip, drip, drip of water. It was not from theeaves, nor yet from a faulty shingle. His back was to the kitchen door,through which he had come, and, although there were no mirrors beforehim, he felt a menacing presence as surely as though it had touchedhim. His ears were tuned to the finest pin-pricks of sound, so that heheard the faint, sighing "squish" of a sodden shoe upon which a weighthad shifted. Still something chained him to his seat. It was as thoughhis soul laid a restraining hand upon his body, waiting for the instant.He let his hand seek his hip carelessly, but remembered where his gunwas. Mechanically, he addressed the note in shaking characters, whilebehind him sounded the constant drip, drip, drip that he knew came fromsaturated garments. For a long moment he sat, till he heard thestealthy click of a gun-lock muffled by finger pressure. Then he sethis face and slowly turned to find the Bronco Kid standing behind himas though risen from the sea, his light clothes wet and clinging, hisfeet centred in a spreading puddle. The dim light showed the convulsivefury of his features above the levelled weapon, whose hammer was curledback like the head of a striking adder, his eyes gleaming with frenzy.Glenister's mouth was powder dry, but his mind was leaping riotouslylike dust before a gale, for he divined himself to be in the deadliestperil of his life. When he spoke the calmness of his voice surprisedhimself."What's the matter, Bronco?" The Kid made no reply, and Roy repeated,"What do you want?""That's a hell of a question," the gambler said, hoarsely. "I want you,of course, and I've got you.""Hold up! I am unarmed. This is your third try, and I want to knowwhat's back of it.""DAMN the talk!" cried the faro-dealer, moving closer till the lightshone on his features, which commenced to twitch. He raised therevolver he had half lowered. "There's reason enough, and you know it."Glenister looked him fairly between the eyes, gripping himself withfirm hands to stop the tremor he felt in his bones. "You can't killme," he said. "I am too good a man to murder. You might shoot a crook,but you can't kill a brave man when he's unarmed. You're no assassin."He remained rigid in his chair, however, moving nothing but his lips,meeting the other's look unflinchingly. The Kid hesitated an instant,while his eyes, which had been fixed with the glare of hatred, wavereda moment, betraying the faintest sign of indecision. Glenister criedout, exultantly:"Ha! I knew it. Your neck cords quiver."The gambler grimaced. "I can't do it. If I could, I'd have shot youbefore you turned. But you'll have to fight, you dog. Get up and draw."Roy refused. "I gave Cherry my gun.""Yes, and more too," the man gritted. "I saw it all."Even yet Glenister had made no slightest move, realizing that afeather's weight might snap the gambler's nervous tension and bring theinvoluntary twitch that would put him out swifter than a whip iscracked."I have tried it before, but murder isn't my game." The Kid's eyecaught the glint of Cherry's revolver where she had discarded it."There's a gun--get it.""It's no good. You'd carry the six bullets and never feel them. I don'tknow what this is all about, but I'll fight you whenever I'm heeledright.""Oh, you black-hearted hound," snarled the Kid. "I want to shoot, butI'm afraid. I used to be a gentleman and I haven't lost it all, Iguess. But I won't wait the next time. I'll down you on sight, so you'dbetter get ironed in a hurry." He backed out of the room into thesemi-darkness of the kitchen, watching with lynx-like closeness the manwho sat so quietly under the shaded light. He felt behind him for theouter door-knob and turned it to let in a white sheet of rain, thenvanished like a storm wraith, leaving a parched-lipped man and a zigzagtrail of water, which gleamed in the lamplight like a pool of blood.CHAPTER XVIIIWHEREIN A TRAP IS BAITEDGlenister did not wait long after his visitor's departure, butextinguished the light, locked the door, and began the furtheradventures of this night. The storm welcomed him with suffocatingviolence, sucking the very breath from his lips, while the rain beatthrough till his flesh was cold and aching. He thought with a pang ofthe girl facing this tempest, going out to meet the thousand perils ofthe night. And it remained for him to bear his part as she bore hers,smilingly.The last hour had added another and mysterious danger to his fullmeasure. Could the Kid be jealous of Cherry? Surely not. Then what else?The tornado had driven his trailers to cover, evidently, for thestreets were given over to its violence, and Roy encountered no hostilesign as he was buffeted from house to house. He adventured cautiouslyand yet with haste, finding certain homes where the marshals had beenbefore him peopled now only by frightened wives and children. Ascattered few of the Vigilantes had been taken thus, while the warringelements had prevented their families from spreading the alarm orventuring out for succor. Those whom he was able to warn dressedhurriedly, took their rifles, and went out into the drifting night,leaving empty cabins and weeping women. The great fight was on.Towards daylight the remnants of the Vigilantes straggled into the bigblank warehouse on the sand-spit, and there beneath the smoking glareof lanterns cursed the name of McNamara. As dawn grayed the raggedeastern sky-line, Dextry and Slapjack blew in through the spindrift,bringing word from Cherry and lifting a load from Glenister's mind."There's a game girl," said the old miner, as he wrung out his clothes."She was half gone when she got to us, and now she's waiting for thestorm to break so that she can come back.""It's clearing up to the east," Slapjack chattered. "D'you know, I'mgettin' so rheumatic that ice-water don't feel comfortable to me nomore.""Uriatic acid in the blood," said Dextry. "What's our next move?" heasked of his partner. "When do we hang this politician? Seems likewe've got enough able-bodied piano-movers here to tie a can onto thewhole outfit, push the town site of Nome off the map, and start afresh.""I think we had better lie low and watch developments," the othercautioned. "There's no telling what may turn up during the day.""That's right. Stranglers is like spirits--they work best in the dark." As the day grew, the storm died, leaving ramparts of cloudshanging sullenly above the ocean's rim, while those skilled in weatherprophecy foretold the coming of the equinoctial. In McNamara's officethere was great stir and the coming of many men. The boss sat in hischair smoking countless cigars, his big face set in grim lines, hishard eyes peering through the pall of blue at those he questioned. Heworked the wires of his machine until his dolls doubled and danced andtwisted at his touch. After a gusty interview he had dismissed Voorheeswith a merciless tongue-lashing, raging bitterly at the man's failure."You're not fit to herd sheep. Thirty men out all night and what do youget? A dozen mullet-headed miners. You bag the mud-hens and the biggame runs to cover. I wanted Glenister, but you let him slip throughyour fingers--now it's war. What a mess you've made! If I had even ONEhelper with a brain the size of a flaxseed, this game would be a gift,but you've bungled every move from the start. Bah! Put a spy in thebull-pen with those prisoners and make them talk. Offer them anythingfor information. Now get out!"He called for a certain deputy and questioned him regarding the night'squest, remarking, finally:"There's treachery somewhere. Those men were warned.""Nobody came near Glenister's house except Miss Chester," the manreplied."What?""The Judge's niece. We caught her by mistake in the dark."Later, one of the men who had been with Voorhees at the Northern askedto see the receiver and told him:"The chief won't believe that I saw Miss Chester in the dance-hall lastnight, but she was there with Glenister. She must have put him wise toour game or he wouldn't have known we were after him."His hearer made no comment, but, when alone, rose and paced the floorwith heavy tread while his face grew savage and brutal."So that's the game, eh? It's man to man from now on. Very well,Glenister, I'll have your life for that, and then--you'll pay, MissHelen." He considered carefully. A plot for a plot. If he could notswap intrigue with these miners and beat them badly, he deserved tolose. Now that the girl gave herself to their cause he would use heragain and see how well she answered. Public opinion would not stand toogreat a strain, and, although he had acted within his rights lastnight, he dared not go much further. Diplomacy, therefore, must serve.He must force his enemies beyond the law and into his trap. She hadpassed the word once; she would do so again.He hurried to Stillman's house and stormed into the presence of theJudge. He told the story so artfully that the Judge's astonishedunbelief yielded to rage and cowardice, and he sent for his niece. Shecame down, white and silent, having heard the loud voices. The old manberated her with shrewish fury, while McNamara stood silent. The girllistened with entire self-control until her uncle made a reference toGlenister that she found intolerable."Hush! I will not listen!" she cried, passionately. "I warned himbecause you would have sacrificed him after he had saved our lives.That is all. He is an honest man, and I am grateful to him. That is theonly foundation for your insult."McNamara, with apparent candor, broke in:"You thought you were doing right, of course, but your action will haveterrible consequences. Now we'll have riot, bloodshed, and Heaven knowswhat. It was to save all this that I wanted to break up theirorganization. A week's imprisonment would have done it, but now they'rearmed and belligerent and we'll have a battle to-night.""No, no!" she cried. "There mustn't be any violence.""There is no use trying to check them. They are rushing to their owndestruction. I have learned that they plan to attack the Midasto-night, and I'll have fifty soldiers waiting for them there. It is ashame, for they are decent fellows, blinded by ignorance and misled bythat young miner. This will be the blackest night the North has everseen."With this McNamara left the house and went in search of Voorhees,remarking to himself: "Now, Miss Helen--send your warning--the soonerthe better. If I know those Vigilantes, it will set them crazy, and yetnot crazy enough to attack the Midas. They will strike for me, and whenthey hit my poor, unguarded office, they'll think hell has moved North.""Mr. Marshal," said he to his tool, "I want you to gather forty menquietly and to arm them with Winchesters. They must be fellows whowon't faint at blood--you know the kind. Assemble them at my officeafter dark, one at a time, by the back way. It must be done withabsolute secrecy. Now, see if you can do this one thing and not getballed up. If you fail, I'll make you answer to me.""Why don't you get the troops?" ventured Voorhees."If there's one thing I want to avoid, it's soldiers, either here or atthe mines. When they step in, we step out, and I'm not ready for thatjust yet." The receiver smiled sinisterly.Helen meanwhile had fled to her room, and there received Glenister'snote through Cherry Malotte's messenger. It rekindled her worst fearsand bore out McNamara's prophecy. The more she read of it the morecertain she grew that the crisis was only a question of hours, and thatwith darkness, Tragedy would walk the streets of Nome. The thought ofthe wrong already done was lost in the lonely girl's terror of thecrime about to happen, for it seemed to her she had been the instrumentto set these forces in motion, that she had loosed this swift-speedingavalanche of greed, hatred, and brutality. And when the crash shouldcome--the girl shuddered. It must not be. She would shriek a warningfrom the house-tops even at cost of her uncle, of McNamara, and ofherself. And yet she had no proof that a crime existed. Although it alllay clear in her own mind, the certainty of it arose only from herintuition. If only she were able to take a hand--if only she were not awoman. Then Cherry Malotte's words anent Struve recurred to her, "Abottle of wine and a woman's face." They brought back the lawyer'sassurance that those documents she had safeguarded all through the longspring-time journey really contained the proof. If they did, then theyheld the power to check this impending conflict. Her uncle and the bosswould not dare continue if threatened with exposure and prosecution.The more she thought of it, the more urgent seemed the necessity toprevent the battle of to-night. There was a chance here, at least, andthe only one.Adding to her mental torment was the constant vision of that face inthe curtains at the Northern. It was her brother, yet what mysteryshrouded this affair, also? What kept him from her? What caused him toslink away like a thief discovered? She grew dizzy and hysterical. Struve turned in his chair as the door to his private officeopened, then leaped to his feet at sight of the gray-eyed girl standingthere."I came for the papers," she said."I knew you would." The blood went out of his cheeks, then surged backup to his eyes. "It's a bargain, then?"She nodded. "Give them to me first."He laughed unpleasantly. "What do you take me for? I'll keep my part ofthe bargain if you'll keep yours. But this is no place, nor time.There's riot in the air, and I'm busy preparing for to-night. Come backto-morrow when it's all over."But it was the terror of to-night's doings that led her into his power."I'll never come back," she said. "It is my whim to know to-day--yes,at once."He meditated for a time. "Then to-day it shall be. I'll shirk thefight, I'll sacrifice what shreds of duty have clung to me, because thefever for you is in my bones, and it seems to me I'd do murder for it.That's the kind of a man I am, and I have no pride in myself because ofit. But I've always been that way We'll ride to the Sign of the Sled.It's a romantic little road-house ten miles from here, perched highabove the Snake River trail. We'll take dinner there together.""But the papers?""I'll have them with me. We'll start in an hour.""In an hour," she echoed, lifelessly, and left him.He chuckled grimly and seized the telephone. "Central--call the Sledroad-house--seven rings on the Snake River branch. Hello! That you,Shortz? This is Struve. Anybody at the house? Good. Turn them away ifthey come and say that you're closed. None of your business. I'll beout about dark, so have dinner for two. Spread yourself and keep theplace clear. Good-bye."Strengthened by Glenister's note, Helen went straight to the otherwoman and this time was not kept waiting nor greeted with sneers, butfound Cherry cloaked in a shy dignity, which she clasped tightly aboutherself. Under her visitor's incoherence she lost her diffidence,however, and, when Helen had finished, remarked, with decision: "Don'tgo with him. He's a bad man.""But I MUST. The blood of those men will be on me if I don't stop thistragedy. If those papers tell the tale I think they do, I can call offmy uncle and make McNamara give back the mines. You said Struve toldyou the whole scheme. Did you see the PROOF?""No, I have only his word, but he spoke of those documents repeatedly,saying they contained his instructions to tie up the mines in order togive a foothold for the lawsuits. He bragged that the rest of the gangwere in his power and that he could land them in the penitentiary forconspiracy. That's all.""It's the only chance," said Helen. "They are sending soldiers to theMidas to lie in ambush, and you must warn the Vigilantes." Cherry paledat this and ejaculated:"Good Lord! Roy said he'd lead an attack to-night." The two stared ateach other."If I succeed with Struve I can stop it all--all of this injustice andcrime--everything.""Do you realize what you're risking?" Cherry demanded. "That man is ananimal. You'll have to kill him to save yourself, and he'll never giveup those proofs.""Yes, he will," said Helen, fiercely, "and I defy him to harm me. TheSign of the Sled is a public roadhouse with a landlord, a telephone,and other guests. Will you warn Mr. Glenister about the troops?""I will, and bless you for a brave girl. Wait a moment." Cherry tookfrom the dresser her tiny revolver. "Don't hesitate to use this. I wantyou to know also that I'm sorry for what I said yesterday."As she hurried away, Helen realized with a shock the change that thepast few months had wrought in her. In truth, it was as Glenister hadsaid, his Northland worked strangely with its denizens. What of thatshrinking girl who had stepped out of the sheltered life, strong onlyin her untried honesty, to become a hunted, harried thing, jugglingwith honor and reputation, in her heart a half-formed fear that shemight kill a man this night to gain her end? The elements were mouldingher with irresistible hands. Roy's contact with the primitive had notroughened him more quickly than had hers.She met her appointment with Struve, and they rode away together, hetalkative and elated, she silent and icy.Late in the afternoon the cloud banks to the eastward assumed alarmingproportions. They brought with them an early nightfall, and when theybroke let forth a tempest which rivalled that of the previous night.During the first of it armed men came sifting into McNamara's officefrom the rear and were hidden throughout the building. Whenever hedescried a peculiarly desperate ruffian the boss called him aside forprivate instruction and gave minute description of a wide-shouldered,erect, youth in white hat and half-boots. Gradually he set his trapwith the men Voorhees had raked from the slums, and when it was donesmiled to himself. As he thought it over he ceased to regret themiscarriage of last night's plan, for it had served to goad his enemiesto the point he desired, to the point where they would rush to theirown undoing. He thought with satisfaction of the role he would play inthe United States press when the sensational news of this night'sadventure came out. A court official who dared to do his duty despite alawless mob. A receiver who turned a midnight attack into a rout andshambles. That is what they would say. What if he did exceed hisauthority thereafter? What if there were a scandal? Who would question?As to soldiers--no, decidedly no. He wished no help of soldiers at thistime.The sight of a ship in the offing towards dark caused him someuneasiness, for, notwithstanding the assurance that the course ofjustice in the San Francisco courts had been clogged, he knew BillWheaton to be a resourceful lawyer and a determined man. Therefore, itrelieved him to note the rising gale, which precluded the possibilityof interference from that source. Let them come to-morrow if theywould. By that time some of the mines would be ownerless and hisposition strengthened a hundredfold.He telephoned the mines to throw out guards, although he reasoned thatnone but madmen would think of striking there in the face of thewarning which he knew must have been transmitted through Helen. Puttingon his rain-coat he sought Stillman."Bring your niece over to my place to-night. There's trouble in the airand I'm prepared for it.""She hasn't returned from her ride yet. I'm afraid she's caught in thestorm." The Judge gazed anxiously into the darkness. During all the long day the Vigilantes lay in hiding, impatientat their idleness and wondering at the lack of effort made towardstheir discovery, not dreaming that McNamara had more cleverly hiddenplans behind. When Cherry's note of warning came they gathered in theback room and gave voice to their opinions."There's only one way to clear the atmosphere," said the chairman."You bet," chorussed the others. "They've garrisoned the mines, solet's go through the town and make a clean job of it. Let's hang thewhole outfit to one post."This met with general approval, Glenister alone demurring. Said he: "Ihave reasoned it out differently, and I want you to hear me throughbefore deciding. Last night I got word from Wheaton that the Californiacourts are against us. He attributes it to influence, but, whatever thereason, we are cut off from all legal help either in this court or onappeal. Now, suppose we lynch these officials to-night--what do wegain? Martial law in two hours, our mines tied up for another year, andwho knows what else? Maybe a corrupter court next season. Suppose, onthe other hand, we fail--and somehow I feel that we will, for that bossis no fool. What then? Those of us who don't find the morgue will endin jail. You say we can't meet the soldiers. I say we can and must. Wemust carry this row to them. We must jump it past the courts of Alaska,past the courts of California, and up to the White House, where there'sone honest man, at least. We must do something to wake up the men inWashington. We must get out of politics, for McNamara can beat usthere. Although he's a strong man he can't corrupt the President. Wehave one shot left, and it must reach the Potomac. When Uncle Sam takesa hand we'll get a square deal, so I say let us strike at the Midasto-night and take her if we can. Some of us will go down, but what ofit?"Following this harangue, he outlined a plan which in its unique daringtook away their breaths, and as he filled in detail after detail theybrightened with excitement and that love of the long chance which makesgamblers of those who thread the silent valleys or tread the edge ofthings. His boldness stirred them and enthusiasm did the rest."All I want for myself," he said, "is the chance to run the big risk.It's mine by right."Dextry spoke, breathlessly, to Slapjack in the pause which ensued:"Ain't he a heller?""We'll go you," the miners chimed to a man. And the chairman added:"Let's have Glenister lead this forlorn hope. I am willing to stand orfall on his judgment." They acquiesced without a dissenting voice andwith the firm hands of a natural leader the young man took control."Let's hurry up," said one. "It's a long 'mush' and the mud isknee-deep.""No walking for us," said Roy. "We'll go by train.""By train? How can we get a train?""Steal it," he answered, at which Dextry grinned delightedly at hisloose-jointed companion, and Slapjack showed his toothless gums inanswer, saying:"He sure is."A few more words and Glenister, accompanied by these two, slipped outinto the whirling storm, and a half-hour later the rest followed. Oneby one the Vigilantes left, the blackness blotting them up anarm's-length from the door, till at last the big, bleak warehouseechoed hollowly to the voice of the wind and water.Over in the eastern end of town, behind dark windows upon which thesheeted rain beat furiously, other armed men lay patientlywaiting--waiting some word from the bulky shadow which stood withfolded arms close against a square of gray, while over their heads awretched old man paced back and forth, wringing his hands, pausing atevery turn to peer out into the night and to mumble the name of hissister's child.CHAPTER XIXDYNAMITEEarly in the evening Cherry Malotte opened her door to find the BroncoKid on her step. He entered and threw off his rubber coat. Knowing himwell, she waited for his disclosure of his errand. His sallow skin waswithout trace of color, his eyes were strangely tired, deep lines hadgathered about his lips, while his hands kept up constant littlenervous explorations as though for days and nights he had not slept andnow hovered on the verge of some hysteria. He gave her the impressionof a smouldering mine with the fire eating close up to the powder. Shejudged that his body had been racked by every passion till now it hungjaded and weary, yielding only to the spur of his restless, revengefulspirit.After a few objectless remarks, he began, abruptly:"Do you love Roy Glenister?" His voice, like his manner, was jealouslyeager, and he watched her carefully as she replied, without quibble ordeceit:"Yes, Kid; and I always shall. He is the only true man I have everknown, and I'm not ashamed of my feelings."For a long time he studied her, and then broke into rapid speech,allowing her no time for interruption."I've held back and held back because I'm no talker. I can't be, in mybusiness; but this is my last chance, and I want to put myself rightwith you. I've loved you ever since the Dawson days, not in the wayyou'd expect from a man of my sort, perhaps, but with the kind of lovethat a woman wants. I never showed my hand, for what was the use? Thatman outheld me. I'd have quit faro years back only I wouldn't leavethis country as long as you were a part of it, and up here I'm only agambler, fit for nothing else. I'd made up my mind to let you have himtill something happened a couple of months ago, but now it can't gothrough. I'll have to down him. It isn't concerning you--I'm not awelcher. No, it's a thing I can't talk about, a thing that's made meinto a wolf, made me skulk and walk the alleys like a dago. It's putmurder into my heart. I've tried to assassinate him. I tried it herelast night--but--I was a gentleman once--till the cards came. He knowsthe answer now, though, and he's ready for me--so one of us will go outlike a candle when we meet. I felt that I had to tell you before I cuthim down or before he got me.""You're talking like a madman, Kid," she replied, "and you mustn't turnagainst him now. He has troubles enough. I never knew you cared for me.What a tangle it is, to be sure. You love me, I love him, he loves thatgirl, and she loves a crook. Isn't that tragedy enough without youradding to it? You come at a bad time, too, for I'm half insane. There'ssomething dreadful in the air to-night--""I'll have to kill him," the man muttered, doggedly, and, plead orreason as she would, she could get nothing from him except those words,till at last she turned upon him fiercely."You say you love me. Very well--let's see if you do. I know the kindof a man you are and I know what this feud will mean to him, comingjust at this time. Put it aside and I'll marry you."The gambler rose slowly to his feet. "You do love him, don't you?" Shebowed her face, and he winced, but continued: "I wouldn't make you mywife that way. I didn't mean it that way."At this she laughed bitterly, "Oh, I see. Of course not. How foolish ofme to expect it of a man like you. I understand what you mean now, andthe bargain will stand just the same, if that is what you came for. Iwanted to leave this life and be good, to go away and start over andplay the game square, but I see it's no use. I'll pay. I know howrelentless you are, and the price is low enough. You can have me--andthat--marriage talk--I'll not speak of again. I'll stay what I am forhis sake.""Stop!" cried the Kid. "You're wrong. I'm not that kind of a sport."His voice broke suddenly, its vehemence shaking his slim body. "Oh,Cherry, I love you the way a man ought to love a woman. It's one of thetwo good things left in me, and I want to take you away from here wherewe can both hide from the past, where we can start new, as you say.""You would marry me?" she asked."In an hour, and give my heart's blood for the privilege; but I can'tstop this thing, not even if your own dear life hung upon it. I MUSTkill that man."She approached him and laid her arms about his neck, every line of herbody pleading, but he refused steadfastly, while the sweat stood outupon his brow.She begged: "They're all against him, Kid. He's fighting a hopelessfight. He laid all he had at that girl's feet, and I'll do the same foryou."The man growled savagely. "He got his reward. He took all she had--""Don't be a fool. I guess I know. You're a faro-dealer, but you haven'tany right to talk like that about a good woman, even to a bad one likeme."Into his dark eyes slowly crept a hungry look, and she felt him beginto tremble the least bit. He undertook to speak, paused, wet his lips,then carefully chose these words:"Do you mean--that he did not--that she is--a good girl?""Absolutely."He sat down weakly and passed a shaking hand over his face, which hadbegun to twitch and jerk again as it had on that night when hisvengeance was thwarted."I may as well tell you that I know she's more than that. She's honestand high-principled. I don't know why I'm saying this, but it was on mymind and I was half distracted when you came. She's in danger to-night,though--at this minute. I don't dare to think of what may havehappened, for she's risked everything to make reparation to Roy and hisfriends.""What?""She's gone to the Sign of the Sled alone with Struve.""Struve!" shouted the gambler, leaping to his feet. "Alone with Struveon a night like this?" He shook her fiercely, crying: "What for? Tellme quick!"She recounted the reasons for Helen's adventure, while the man's facebecame terrible."Oh, Kid, I am to blame for letting her go. Why did I do it? I'mafraid--afraid.""The Sign of the Sled belongs to Struve, and the fellow who runs it isa rogue." The Bronco looked at the clock, his eyes bloodshot and dulllike those of a goaded, fly-maddened bull. "It's eight o'clock now--tenmiles--two hours. Too late!""What ails you?" she questioned, baffled by his strange demeanor. "Youcalled ME the one woman just now, and yet--"He swung towards her heavily. "She's my sister.""Your--sister? Oh, I--I'm glad. I'm glad--but don't stand there like awooden man, for you've work to do. Wake up. Can't you hear? She's inperil!" Her words whipped him out of his stupor so that he drew himselfsomewhat under control. "Get into your coat. Hurry! Hurry! My pony willtake you there." She snatched his garment from the chair and held itfor him while the life ran back into his veins. Together they dashedout into the storm as she and Roy had done, and as he flung the saddleon the buckskin, she said:"I understand it all now. You heard the talk about her and Glenister;but it's wrong. I lied and schemed and intrigued against her, but it'sover now. I guess there's a little streak of good in me somewhere,after all."He spoke to her from the saddle. "It's more than a streak, Cherry, andyou're my kind of people." She smiled wanly back at him under thelantern-light."That's left-handed, Kid. I don't want to be your kind. I want to behis kind--or your sister's kind."Upon leaving the rendezvous, Glenister and his two friends slunkthrough the night, avoiding the life and lights of the town, while thewind surged out of the voids to seaward, driving its wet burden throughtheir flapping slickers, pelting their faces as though enraged at itsfailure to wash away the purposes written there. Their course broughtthem to a cabin at the western outskirts of the city, where they pausedlong enough to adjust something beneath the brims of their hats.Past them ran the iron rails of the narrow-gauged road which led outacross the quaking tundra to the mountains and the mines. Upon thisslender trail of steel there rolled one small, ungainly teapot of anengine which daily creaked and clanked back and forth at a snail'space, screaming and wailing its complaint of the two high-loadedflat-cars behind. The ties beneath it were spiked to planks laidlengthwise over the semi-liquid road-bed, in places sagging beneath thesurface till the humpbacked, short-waisted locomotive yawed and reeledand squealed like a drunken fish-wife. At night it panted wearily intothe board station and there sighed and coughed and hissed away itsfatigue as the coals died and the breath relaxed in its lungs.Early to bed and early to rise was perforce the motto of its grimycrew, who lived near by. To-night they were just retiring when stayedby a summons at their door. The engineer opened it to admit whatappeared to his astonished eyes to be a Krupp cannon propelled by a manin yellow-oiled clothes and white cotton mask. This weapon assumed theproportions of a great, one-eyed monster, which stared with balefulfixity at his vitals, giving him a cold and empty feeling. Away backbeyond this Cyclops of the Sightless Orb were two other strangerslikewise equipped.The fireman arose from his chair, dropping an empty shoe with a thump,but, being of the West, without cavil or waste of wind, he stretchedhis hands above his head, balancing on one foot to keep his unshodmember from the damp floor. He had unbuckled his belt, and now,loosened by the movement, his overalls seemed bent on sinking floorwardin an ecstasy of abashment at the intrusion, whereupon with convulsivegrip he hugged them to their duty, one hand and foot still elevated asthough in the grand hailing-sign of some secret order. The other manwas new to the ways of the North, so backed to the limit of hisquarters, laid both hands protectingly upon his middle, and doubled up,remarking, fervidly:"Don't point that damn thing at my stomach.""Ha, ha!" laughed the fireman, with unnatural loudness. "Have your jokeboys.""This ain't no joke," said the foremost figure, its breath bellying outthe mask at its mouth."Sure it is," insisted the shoeless one. "Must be--we ain't gotanything worth stealing.""Get into your clothes and come along. We won't hurt you." The twoobeyed and were taken to the sleeping engine and there instructed toproduce a full head of steam in thirty minutes or suffer a prematuretaking off and a prompt elision from the realms of applied mechanics.As stimulus to their efforts two of the men stood over them till theengine began to sob and sigh reluctantly. Through the gloom thatcurtained the cab they saw other dim forms materializing and climbingsilently on to the cars behind; then, as the steam-gauge touched themark, the word was given and the train rumbled out from its shelter,its shrill plaint at curb and crossing whipped away and drowned in thestorm.Slapjack remained in the cab, gun in lap, while Dextry climbed back toGlenister. He found the young man in good spirits, despite thediscomfort of his exposed position, and striving to light his pipebehind the shelter of his coat."Is the dynamite aboard?" the old man questioned."Sure. Enough to ballast a battle-ship."As the train crept out of the camp and across the river bridge, itsonly light or glimmer the sparks that were snatched and harried by theblast, the partners seated themselves on the powder cases and conversedguardedly, while about them sounded the low murmur of the men whorisked their all upon this cry to duty, who staked their lives andfutures upon this hazard of the hills, because they thought it right."We've made a good fight, whether we win or lose to-night," said Dextry.Roy replied, "MY fight is made and won.""What does that mean?""My hardest battle had nothing to do with the Midas or the mines ofAnvil. I fought and conquered myself.""Awful wet night for philosophy," the first remarked. "It's apt to souron you like milk in a thunder-storm. S'pose you put overalls an' gumboots on some of them Boston ideas an' lead 'em out where I can look'em over an' find out what they're up to.""I mean that I was a savage till I met Helen Chester and she made a manof me. It took sixty days, but I think she did a good job. I love thewild things just as much as ever, but I've learned that there areduties a fellow owes to himself, and to other people, if he'll onlystop and think them out. I've found out, too, that the right thing isusually the hardest to do. Oh, I've improved a lot.""Gee! but you're popular with yourself. I don't see as it helps yourlooks any. You're as homely as ever--an' what good does it do you afterall? She'll marry that big guy.""I know. That's what rankles, for he's no more worthy of her than I am.She'll do what's right, however, you may depend upon that, and perhapsshe'll change him the way she did me. Why, she worked a miracle in myattitude towards life--my manner--""Oh, your manners are good enough as they lay," interrupted the other."You never did eat with your knife.""I don't believe in hara-kiri," Glenister laughed."No, when it comes to intimacies with decorum, you're right on the jobalong with any of them Easterners. I watched you close at them 'Friscohotels last winter, and, say--you know as much as a horse. Why, you waswise to them tablewares and pickle-forks equal to a head-waiter, and itgive me confidence just to be with you. I remember putting milk andsugar in my consomme the first time. It was pale and in a cup andlooked like tea--but not you. No, sir! You savvied plenty and squeezeda lemon into yours--to clean your fingers, I reckon."Roy slapped his partner's wet back, for he was buoyant and elated. Thesense of nearing danger pulsed through him like wine. "That wasn't justwhat I meant, but it goes. Say, if we win back our mine, we'll hit forNew York next--eh?""No, I don't aim to mingle with no higher civilization than I got in'Frisco. I use that word 'higher' like it was applied to meat. Not thatI wouldn't seem apropos, I'm stylish enough for Fifth Avenue oranywheres, but I like the West. Speakin' of modes an' styles, when Iget all lit up in that gray woosted suit of mine, I guess I make thejaded sight-seers set up an' take notice--eh? Somethin' doin' everyminute in the cranin' of necks--what? Nothin' gaudy, but the acme ofneatness an' form, as the feller said who sold it to me."Their common peril brought the friends together again, into that closebond which had been theirs without interruption until this recentchange in the younger had led him to choose paths at variance with theold man's ideas; and now they spoke, heart to heart, in thehalf-serious, half-jesting ways of old, while beneath each whimsicalirony was that mutual love and understanding which had consecratedtheir partnership.Arriving at the end of the road, the Vigilantes debouched and went intothe darkness of the canon behind their leader, to whom the trails werefamiliar. He bade them pause finally, and gave his last instructions."They are on the alert, so you want to be careful. Divide into twoparties and close in from both sides, creeping as near to the picketsas possible without discovery. Remember to wait for the last blast.When it comes, cut loose and charge like Sioux. Don't shoot to kill atfirst, for they're only soldiers and under orders, but if theystand--well, every man must do his work."Dextry appealed to the dim figures forming the circle."I leave it to you, gents, if it ain't better for me to go inside thanfor the boy. I've had more experience with giant powder, an' I'm soblamed used up an' near gone it wouldn't hurt if they did get me, whilehe's right in his prime--"Glenister stopped him. "I won't yield the privilege. Come now--to yourplaces, men."They melted away to each side while the old prospector paused to wringhis partner's hand."I'd ruther it was me, lad, but if they get you--God help 'em!" Hestumbled after the departing shadows, leaving Roy alone. With his nakedfingers, Glenister ripped open the powder cases and secreted thecontents upon his person. Each cartridge held dynamite enough todevastate a village, and he loaded them inside his pockets, inside hisshirt, and everywhere that he had room, till he was burdened and casedin an armor one-hundredth part of which could have blown him from theface of the earth so utterly as to leave no trace except, perhaps, apit ripped out of the mountain-side. He looked to his fuses and sawthat they were wrapped in oiled paper, then placed them in his hat.Having finished, he set out, walking with difficulty under the weighthe carried.That his choice of location had been well made was evidenced by thefact that the ground beneath his feet sloped away to a basin out ofwhich bubbled a spring. It furnished the drinking supply of the Midas,and he knew every inch of the crevice it had worn down the mountain, sofelt his way cautiously along. At the bottom of the hill where it ranout upon the level it had worn a considerable ditch through the soil,and into this he crawled on hands and knees. His bulging clotheshandicapped him so that his gait was slow and awkward, while the rainhad swelled the streamlet till it trickled over his calves and up tohis wrists, chilling him so that his muscles cramped and his very bonescried out with it. The sharp schist cut into his palms till they wereshredded and bleeding, while his knees found every jagged bit ofbed-rock over which he dragged himself. He could not see anarm's-length ahead without rising, and, having removed his slicker forgreater freedom of movement, the rain beat upon his back till he wassoaked and sodden and felt streamlets cleaving downward between hisribs. Now and again he squatted upon his haunches, straining his eyesto either side. The banks were barely high enough to shield him. Atlast he came to a bridge of planks spanning the ditch and was about torear himself for another look when he suddenly flattened into thestream bed, half damming the waters with his body. It was for this hehad so carefully wrapped his fuses. A man passed over him so closeabove that he might have touched him. The sentry paused a few pacesbeyond and accosted another, then retraced his steps over the bridge.Evidently this was the picket-line, so Roy wormed his way forward tillhe saw the blacker blackness of the mine buildings, then drew himselfdripping out from the bank. He had run the gauntlet safely.Since evicting the owners, the receiver had erected substantial housesin place of the tents he had found on the mine. They were of frame andcorrugated-iron, sheathed within and suited to withstand a moderateexposure. The partners had witnessed the operation from a distance, butknew nothing about the buildings from close examination.A thrill of affection for this place wanned the young man. He lovedthis old mine. It had realized the dream of his boyhood, and hadanswered the hope he had clung to during his long fight against theNorthland. It had come to him when he was disheartened, bringing cheerand happiness, and had yielded itself like a bride. Now it seemed acrime to ravage it.He crept towards the nearest wall and listened. Within was the sound ofvoices, though the windows were dark, showing that the inhabitants wereon the alert. Beneath the foundations he made mysterious preparations,then sought out the office building and cook-house, doing likewise. Hefound that back of the seeming repose of the Midas there was a strainedexpectancy.Although suspense had lengthened the time out of all calculation, hejudged he had been gone from his companions at least an hour and thatthey must be in place by now. If they were not--if anything failed atthis eleventh hour--well, those were the fortunes of war. In everyenterprise, however carefully planned, there comes a time when chancemust take its turn.He made his way inside the blacksmith-shop and fumbled for a match.Just as he was about to strike it he heard the swish of oiled clothespassing, and waited for some time. Then, igniting his punk and hidingit under his coat, he opened the door to listen. The wind had died downnow and the rain sang musically upon the metal roofs.He ran swiftly from house to house, and, when he had done, at theapices of the triangle he had traced three glowing coals weresputtering.The final bolt was launched at last. He stepped down into the ditch anddrew his .45, while to his tautened senses it seemed that the veryhills leaned forth in breathless pause, that the rain had ceased, andthe whole night hushed its thousand voices. He found his lower jaw setso stiffly that the muscles ached. Levelling his weapon at the eaves ofthe bunk-house, he pulled trigger rapidly--the bang, bang, bang, sixtimes repeated, sounding dull and dead beneath the blanket of mist thatoverhung. A shout sounded behind him, and then the shriek of aWinchester ball close over his head. He turned in time to see anothershot stream out of the darkness, where a sentry was firing at the flashof his gun, then bent himself double and plunged down the ditch.With the first impact overhead the men poured forth from their quartersarmed and bristling, to be greeted by a volley of gunshots, the thud ofbullets, and the dwindling whine of spent lead. They leaped fromshelter to find themselves girt with a fitful hoop of fire, for the"Stranglers" had spread in the arc of a circle and now emptied theirrifles towards the centre. The defenders, however, maintainedsurprising order considering the suddenness of their attack, and ran tojoin the sentries, whose positions could be determined by the nearerflashes. The voice of a man in authority shouted loud commands. Nodemonstration came from the outer voids, nothing but the wicked streaksthat stabbed the darkness. Then suddenly, behind McNamara's men, thenight glared luridly as though a great furnace-door had opened and thenclanged shut, while with it came a hoarse thudding roar that silencedthe rifle play. They saw the cook-house disrupt itself and disintegrateinto a thousand flying timbers and twisted sheets of tin which soaredupward and outward over their heads and into the night. As the rockinghills ceased echoing, the sound of the Vigilantes' rifles recurred likethe cracking of dry sticks, then everywhere about the defenders theearth was lashed by falling debris while the iron roofs rang at thefusillade.The blast had come at their very elbows, and they were too dazed andshaken by it to grasp its significance. Then, before they could realizewhat it boded, the depths lit up again till the raindrops were outlineddistinct and glistening like a gossamer veil of silver, while theoffice building to their left was ripped and rended and the adjoiningwalls leaped out into sudden relief, their shattered windows lookinglike ghostly, sightless eyes. The curtain of darkness closed heavierthan velvet, and the men cowered in their tracks, shielding themselvesbehind the nearest objects or behind one another's bodies, waiting forthe sky to vomit over them its rain of missiles. Their backs were tothe Vigilantes now, their faces to the centre. Many had dropped theirrifles. The thunder of hoofs and the scream of terrified horses camefrom the stables. The cry of a maddened beast is weird and calculatedto curdle the blood at best, but with it arose a human voice, shriekingfrom pain and fear of death. A wrenched and doubled mass of zinc hadhurtled out of the heavens and struck some one down. The chokinghoarseness of the man's appeal told the story, and those about himbroke into flight to escape what might follow, to escape this dangerthey could not see but which swooped out of the blackness above andagainst which there was no defence. They fled only to witness anotherand greater light behind them by which they saw themselves running,falling, grovelling. This time they were hurled from their balance by aconcussion which dwarfed the two preceding ones. Some few stood still,staring at the rolling smoke-bank as it was revealed by the explosion,their eyes gleaming white, while others buried their faces in theirhollowed arms as if to shut out the hellish glare, or to shieldthemselves from a blow.Out in the heart of the chaos rang a voice loud and clear:"Beware the next blast!"At the same instant the girdle of sharp-shooters rose up smiting theair with their cries and charged in like madmen through the rain ofdetritus. They fired as they came, but it was unnecessary, for therewas no longer a fight. It was a rout. The defenders, feeling they hadescaped destruction only by a happy chance in leaving the bunk-housethe instant they did, were not minded to tarry here where the heavensfell upon their heads. To augment their consternation, the horses hadbroken from their stalls and were plunging through the confusion. Fearswept over the men--blind, unreasoning, contagious--and they rushed outinto the night, colliding with their enemies, overrunning them in thepanic to quit this spot. Some dashed off the bluff and fell among thepits and sluices. Others ran up the mountain-side, and cowered in thebrush like quail.As the "Stranglers" assembled their prisoners near the ruins, theyheard wounded men moaning in the darkness, so lit torches and searchedout the stricken ones. Glenister came running through the smoke pall,revolver in hand, crying: "Has any one seen McNamara?" No one had, andwhen they were later assembled to take stock of their injuries he wasgreeted by Dextry's gleeful announcement:"That's the deuce of a fight. We 'ain't got so much as a cold soreamong us.""We have captured fourteen," another announced, "and there may be moreout yonder in the brush."Glenister noted with growing surprise that not one of the prisonerslined up beneath the glaring torches wore the army blue. They wereminers all, or thugs and ruffians gathered from the camp. Where, hewondered, were the soldiers."Didn't you have troops from the barracks to help you?" he asked."Not a troop. We haven't seen a soldier since we went to work."At this the young leader became alarmed. Had this whole attackmiscarried? Had this been no clash with the United States forces, afterall? If so, the news would never reach Washington, and instead ofaccomplishing his end, he and his friends had thrust themselves intothe realms of outlawry, where the soldiers could be employed againstthem with impunity, where prices would rest upon their heads. Innocentblood had been shed, court property destroyed. McNamara had them wherehe wanted them at last. They were at bay.The unwounded prisoners were taken to the boundaries of the Midas andreleased with such warnings as the imagination of Dextry could conjureup; then Glenister assembled his men, speaking to them plainly."Boys, this is no victory. In fact, we're worse off than we werebefore, and our biggest fight is coming. There's a chance to get awaynow before daylight and before we're recognized, but if we're seen hereat sun-up we'll have to stay and fight. Soldiers will be sent againstus, but if we hold out, and the struggle is fierce enough, it may reachto Washington. This will be a different kind of fighting now, though.It will be warfare pure and simple. How many of you will stick?""All of us," said they, in unison, and, accordingly, preparations for asiege were begun. Barricades were built, ruins removed, buildingstransformed into blockhouses, and all through the turbulent night thetired men labored till ready to drop, led always by the young giant,who seemed without fatigue.It was perhaps four hours after midnight when a man sought him out."Somebody's callin' you on the Assay Office telephone--says it's lifeor death."Glenister hurried to the building, which had escaped the shock of theexplosions, and, taking down the receiver, was answered by CherryMalotte."Thank God, you're safe," she began. "The men have just come in and thewhole town is awake over the riot. They say you've killed ten people inthe fight--is it true?"He explained to her briefly that all was well, but she broke in:"Wait, wait! McNamara has called for troops and you'll all be shot. Oh,what a terrible night it has been! I haven't been to bed. I'm goingmad. Now, listen, carefully--yesterday Helen went with Struve to theSign of the Sled and she hasn't come back."The man at the end of the wire cried out at this, then choked back hiswords to hear what followed. His free hand began making strange, futilemotions as though he traced patterns in the air."I can't raise the road-house on the wire and--something dreadful hashappened, I know.""What made her go?" he shouted."To save you," came Cherry's faint reply. "If you love her, ride fastto the Sign of the Sled or you'll be too late. The Bronco Kid has gonethere--"At that name Roy crashed the instrument to its hook and burst out ofthe shanty, calling loudly to his men."What's up?""Where are you going?""To the Sign of the Sled," he panted."We've stood by you, Glenister, and you can't quit us like this," saidone, angrily. "The trail to town is good, and we'll take it if you do."Roy saw they feared he was deserting, feared that he had heard somealarming rumor of which they did not know."We'll let the mine go, boys, for I can't ask you to do what I refuseto do myself, and yet it's not fear that's sending me. There's a womanin danger and I MUST go. She courted ruin to save us all, risked herhonor to try and right a wrong--and--I'm afraid of what has happenedwhile we were fighting here. I don't ask you to stay till I comeback--it wouldn't be square, and you'd better go while you have achance. As for me--I gave up the old claim once--I can do it again." Heswung himself to the horse's back, settled into the saddle, and rodeout through the lane of belted men.CHAPTER XXIN WHICH THREE GO TO THE SIGN OF THE SLED AND BUT TWO RETURNAs Helen and her companion ascended the mountain, scarred and swept bythe tempest of the previous night, they heard, far below, the swollentorrent brawling in its bowlder-ridden bed, while behind them the angryocean spread southward to a blood-red horizon. Ahead, the bleakmountains brooded over forbidding valleys; to the west a suffused sunglared sullenly, painting the high-piled clouds with the gorgeous huesof a stormy sunset. To Helen the wild scene seemed dyed with the colorsof flame and blood and steel."That rain raised the deuce with the trails," said Struve, as theypicked their way past an unsightly "slip" whence a part of theoverhanging mountain, loosened by the deluge, had slid into the gulch."Another storm like that would wash out these roads completely."Even in the daylight it was no easy task to avoid these danger spots,for the horses floundered on the muddy soil. Vaguely the girl wonderedhow she would find her way back in the darkness, as she had planned.She said little as they approached the road-house, for the thoughtswithin her brain had begun to clamor too wildly; but Struve, morearrogant than ever before, more terrifyingly sure of himself, wasloudly garrulous. As they drew nearer and nearer, the dread thatpossessed the girl became of paralyzing intensity. If she shouldfail--but she vowed she would not, could not, fail.They rounded a bend and saw the Sign of the Sled cradled below themwhere the trail dipped to a stream which tumbled from the comb aboveinto the river twisting like a silver thread through the distantvalley. A peeled flag-pole topped by a spruce bough stood in front ofthe tavern, while over the door hung a sled suspended from a beam. Thehouse itself was a quaint structure, rambling and amorphous, from whosesod roof sprang blooming flowers, and whose high-banked walls werepierced here and there with sleepy windows. It had been built by ahomesick foreigner of unknown nationality whom the army of "mushers"who paid for his clean and orderly hospitality had dubbed duly and as amatter of course a "Swede." When travel had changed to the river trail,leaving the house lonesome and high as though left by a receding wave,Struve had taken it over on a debt, and now ran it for the convenienceof a slender traffic, mainly stampeders, who chose the higher routetowards the interior. His hireling spent the idle hours in prospectinga hungry quartz lead and in doing assessment work on near-by claims.Shortz took the horses and answered his employer's questions curtly,flashing a curious look at Helen. Under other conditions the girl wouldhave been delighted with the place, for this was the quaintest spot shehad found in the north country. The main room held bar and gold-scales,a rude table, and a huge iron heater, while its walls and ceiling weresheeted with white cloth so cunningly stitched and tacked that itseemed a cavern hollowed from chalk. It was filled with trophies of thehills, stuffed birds and animals, skins and antlers, from whichdepended, in careless confusion, dog harness, snow-shoes, guns, andarticles of clothing. A door to the left led into the bunk-room wheretravellers had been wont to sleep in tiers three deep. To the rear wasa kitchen and cache, to the right a compartment which Struve called theart gallery. Here, free reign had been allowed the original owner'sartistic fancies, and he had covered the place with pictures clippedfrom gazettes of questionable repute till it was a bewilderingarrangement of pink ladies in tights, pugilists in scanty trunks, prizebulldogs, and other less moral characters of the sporting world."This is probably the worst company you were ever in," Struve observedto Helen, with a forced attempt at lightness."Are there no guests here?" she asked him, her anxiety very near thesurface."Travel is light at this time of the year. They'll come in later,perhaps."A fire was burning in this pink room where the landlord had begunspreading the table for two, and its warmth was grateful to the girl.Her companion, thoroughly at his ease, stretched himself on afur-covered couch and smoked."Let me see the papers, now, Mr. Struve," she began, but he put her off."No, not now. Business must wait on our dinner. Don't spoil our littleparty, for there's time enough and to spare."She arose and went to the window, unable to sit still. Looking down thenarrow gulch she saw that the mountains beyond were indistinct for itwas growing dark rapidly. Dense clouds had rolled up from the east. Arain-drop struck the glass before her eyes, then another and another,and the hills grew misty behind the coming shower. A traveller with apack on his back hurried around the corner of the building and past herto the door. At his knock, Struve, who had been watching Helen throughhalf-shut eyes, arose and went into the other room."Thank Heaven, some one has come," she thought. The voices weredeadened to a hum by the sod walls, till that of the stranger raiseditself in such indignant protest that she distinguished his words."Oh, I've got money to pay my way. I'm no dead-head."Shortz mumbled something back."I don't care if you are closed. I'm tired and there's a storm coming."This time she heard the landlord's refusal and the miner's angryprofanity. A moment later she saw the traveller plodding up the trailtowards town."What does that mean?" she inquired, as the lawyer re-entered."Oh, that fellow is a tough, and Shortz wouldn't let him in. He'scareful whom he entertains--there are so many bad men roaming thehills."The German came in shortly to light the lamp, and, although she askedno further questions, Helen's uneasiness increased. She half listenedto the stories with which Struve tried to entertain her and ate littleof the excellent meal that was shortly served to them. Struve,meanwhile, ate and drank almost greedily, and the shadowy, sinisterevening crept along. A strange cowardice had suddenly overtaken thegirl; and if, at this late hour, she could have withdrawn, she wouldhave done so gladly and gone forth to meet the violence of the tempest.But she had gone too far for retreat; and realizing that, for thepresent, apparent compliance was her wisest resource, she sat quiet,answering the man with cool words while his eyes grew brighter, hisskin more flushed, his speech more rapid. He talked incessantly andwith feverish gayety, smoking numberless cigarettes and apparentlyunconscious of the flight of time. At last he broke off suddenly andconsulted his watch, while Helen remembered that she had not heardShortz in the kitchen for a long time. Suddenly Struve smiled on herpeculiarly, with confident cunning. As he leered at her over thedisorder between them he took from his pocket a flat bundle which hetossed to her."Now for the bargain, eh?""Ask the man to remove these dishes," she said, as she undid the parcelwith clumsy fingers."I sent him away two hours ago," said Struve, arising as if to come toher. She shrank back, but he only leaned across, gathered up the fourcorners of the tablecloth, and, twisting them together, carried thewhole thing out, the dishes crashing and jangling as he threw hisburden recklessly into the kitchen. Then he returned and stood with hisback to the stove, staring at her while she perused the contents of thepapers, which were more voluminous than she had supposed.For a long time the girl pored over the documents. The purport of thepapers was only too obvious; and, as she read, the proof of her uncle'sguilt stood out clear and damning. There was no possibility of mistake;the whole wretched plot stood out plain, its darkest infamies revealed.In spite of the cruelty of her disillusionment, Helen was neverthelessexalted with the fierce ecstasy of power, with the knowledge thatjustice would at last be rendered. It would be her triumph and herexpiation that she, who had been the unwitting tool of this miserableclique, would be the one through whom restitution was made. She arosewith her eyes gleaming and her lips set."It is here.""Of course it is. Enough to convict us all. It means the penitentiaryfor your precious uncle and your lover." He stretched his chin upwardat the mention as though to free his throat from an invisible clutch."Yes, your lover particularly, for he's the real one. That's why Ibrought you here. He'll marry you, but I'll be the best man." Thetimbre of his voice was unpleasant."Come, let us go," she said."Go," he chuckled, mirthlessly. "That's a fine example of unconscioushumor.""What do you mean?""Well, first, no human being could find his way down to the coast inthis tempest; second--but, by-the-way, let me explain something inthose papers while I think of it." He spoke casually and steppedforward, reaching for the package, which she was about to give up, whensomething prompted her to snatch it behind her back; and it was wellshe did, for his hand was but a few inches away. He was no match forher quickness, however, and she glided around the table, thrusting thepapers into the front of her dress. The sudden contact with Cherry'srevolver gave her a certain comfort. She spoke now with determination."I intend to leave here at once. Will you bring my horse? Very well, Ishall do it myself."She turned, but his indolence vanished like a flash, and springing infront of the door he barred her way."Hold on, my lady. You ought to understand without my saying any more.Why did I bring you here? Why did I plan this little party? Why did Isend that man away? Just to give you the proof of my complicity in acrime, I suppose. Well, hardly. You won't leave here to-night. And whenyou do, you won't carry those papers--my own safety depends on that andI am selfish, so don't get me started. Listen!" They caught the wail ofthe night crying as though hungry for sacrifice. "No, you'll stay hereand--"He broke off abruptly, for Helen had stepped to the telephone and takendown the receiver. He leaped, snatched it from her, and then, tearingthe instrument loose from the wall, raised it above his head, dashed itupon the floor, and sprang towards her, but she wrenched herself freeand fled across the room. The man's white hair was wildly tumbled, hisface was purple, and his neck and throat showed swollen, throbbingveins. He stood still, however, and his lips cracked into hisever-present, cautious smile."Now, don't let's fight about this. It's no use, for I've played towin. You have your proof--now I'll have my price--or else I'll take it.Think over which it will be, while I lock up."Far down the mountain-side a man was urging a broken pony recklesslyalong the trail. The beast was blown and spent, its knees weak andbending, yet the rider forced it as though behind him yelled a thousanddevils, spurring headlong through gully and ford, up steep slopes anddown invisible ravines. Sometimes the animal stumbled and fell with itsmaster, sometimes they arose together, but the man was heedless of allexcept his haste, insensible to the rain which smote him blindingly,and to the wind which seized him savagely upon the ridges, or gasped athim in the gullies with exhausted malice. At last he gained the plateauand saw the road-house light beneath, so drove his heels into theflanks of the wind-broken creature, which lunged forward gamely. Hefelt the pony rear and drop away beneath him, pawing and scrambling,and instinctively kicked his feet free from the stirrups, striving tothrow himself out of the saddle and clear of the thrashing hoofs. Itseemed that he turned over in the air before something smote him and helay still, his gaunt, dark face upturned to the rain, while about himthe storm screamed exultantly.The moment Struve disappeared into the outer room Helen darted to thewindow. It was merely a single sash, nailed fast and immovable, butseizing one of the little stools beside the stove she thrust it throughthe glass, letting in a smother of wind and water. Before she couldescape, Struve bounded into the room, his face livid with anger, hisvoice hoarse and furious.But as he began to denounce her he paused in amazement, for the girlhad drawn Cherry's weapon and levelled it at him. She was very pale andher breast heaved as from a swift run, while her wondrous gray eyeswere lit with a light no man had ever seen there before, glowing liketwo jewels whose hearts contained the pent-up passion of centuries. Shehad altered as though under the deft hand of a master-sculptor, hernostrils growing thin and arched, her lips tight pressed and pitiless,her head poised proudly. The rain drove in through the shatteredwindow, over and past her, while the cheap red curtain lashed andwhipped her as though in gleeful applause. Her bitter abhorrence of theman made her voice sound strangely unnatural as she commanded:"Don't dare to stop me." She moved towards the door, motioning him toretreat before her, and he obeyed, recognizing the danger of hercoolness. She did not note the calculating treachery of his glance,however, nor fathom the purposes he had in mind. Out on the rain-swept mountain the prostrate rider had regainedhis senses and now was crawling painfully towards the road-house. Seenthrough the dark he would have resembled some misshapen, creepingmonster, for he dragged himself, reptile-like, close to the ground. Butas he came closer the man heard a cry which the wind seemed guardingfrom his ear, and, hearing it, he rose and rushed blindly forward,staggering like a wounded beast.Helen watched her captive closely as he backed through the door beforeher, for she dared not lose sight of him until free. The middle roomwas lighted by a glass lamp on the bar and its rays showed that thefront-door was secured by a large iron bolt. She thanked Heaven therewas no lock and key.Struve had retreated until his back was to the counter, offering noword, making no move, but the darting brightness of his eyes showedthat he was alert and planning. But when the door behind Helen, urgedby the wind through the broken casement, banged to, the man made hisfirst lightning-like sign. He dashed the lamp to the floor, where itburst like an eggshell, and darkness leaped into the room as an animalpounces. Had she been calmer or had time for an instant's thought Helenwould have hastened back to the light, but she was midway to herliberty and actuated by the sole desire to break out into the open air,so plunged forward. Without warning, she was hurled from her feet by abody which came out of the darkness upon her. She fired the little gun,but Struve's arms closed about her, the weapon was wrenched from herhand, and she found herself fighting against him, breast to breast,with the fury of desperation. His wine-burdened breath beat into herface and she felt herself bound to him as though by hoops, while thetouch of his cheek against hers turned her into a terrified, insensateanimal, which fought with every ounce of its strength and every nerveof its body. She screamed once, but it was not like the cry of a woman.Then the struggle went on in silence and utter blackness, Stroveholding her like a gorilla till she grew faint and her head began towhirl, while darting lights drove past her eyes and there was the roarof a cataract in her ears. She was a strong girl, and her ripe youngbody, untried until this moment, answered in every fibre, so that shewrestled with almost a man's strength and he had hard shift to holdher. But so violent an encounter could not last. Helen felt herselfdrifting free from the earth and losing grip of all things tangible,when at last they tripped and fell against the inner door. This gaveway, and at the same moment the man's strength departed as though itwere a thing of darkness and dared not face the light that streamedover them. She tore herself from his clutch and staggered into thesupper-room, her loosened hair falling in a gleaming torrent about hershoulders, while he arose from his knees and came towards her again,gasping:"I'll show you who's master here--"Then he ceased abruptly, cringingly, and threw up an arm before hisface as if to ward off a blow. Framed in the window was the pallidvisage of a man. The air rocked, the lamp flared, and Struve whirledcompletely around, falling back against the wall. His eyes filled withhorror and shifted down where his hand had clutched at his breast,plucking at one spot as if tearing a barb from his bosom. He jerked hishead towards the door at his elbow in quest of a retreat a shudder ranover him, his knees buckled and he plunged forward upon his face, hisarm still doubled under him.It had happened like a flash of light, and although Helen felt, ratherthan heard, the shot and saw her assailant fall, she did not realizethe meaning of it till a drift of powder smoke assailed her nostrils.Even so, she experienced no shock nor horror of the sight. On thecontrary, a savage joy at the spectacle seized her and she stood still,leaning slightly forward, staring at it almost gloatingly, stood sotill she heard her name called, "Helen, little sister!" and, turning,saw her brother in the window.That which he witnessed in her face he had seen before in the faces ofmen locked close with a hateful death and from whom all but the mostelemental passions had departed--but he had never seen a woman bear themarks till now. No artifice nor falsity was there, nothing but thecrudest, intensest feeling, which many people live and die withoutknowing. There are few who come to know the great primitive, passionatelongings. But in this black night, fighting in defence of her mostsacred self, this girl's nature had been stripped to its purely savageelements. As Glenister had predicted, Helen at last had felt andyielded to irresistibly powerful impulse.Glancing backward at the creature sprawled by the door, Helen went toher brother, put her arms about his neck, and kissed him."He's dead?" the Kid asked her.She nodded and tried to speak, but began to shiver and sob instead."Unlock the door," he begged her. "I'm hurt, and I must get in."When the Kid had hobbled into the room, she pressed him to her andstroked his matted head, regardless of his muddy, soaking garments."I must look at him. He may not be badly hurt," said the Kid."Don't touch him!" She followed, nevertheless, and stood near by whileher brother examined his victim. Struve was breathing, and, discoveringthis, the others lifted him with difficulty to the couch."Something cracked in here--ribs, I guess," the Kid remarked, gaspingand feeling his own side. He was weak and pale, and the girl led himinto the bunk-room, where he could lie down. Only his wonderfuldetermination had sustained him thus far, and now the knowledge of hishelplessness served to prevent Helen's collapse.The Kid would not hear of her going for help till the storm abated ordaylight came, insisting that the trails were too treacherous and thatno time could be saved by doing so. Thus they waited for the dawn. Atlast they heard the wounded man faintly calling. He spoke to Helenhoarsely. There was no malice, only fear, in his tones:"I said this was my madness--and I got what I deserved, but I'm goingto die. O God--I'm going to die and I'm afraid." He moaned till theBronco Kid hobbled in, glaring with unquenched hatred."Yes, you're going to die and I did it. Be game, can't you? I sha'n'tlet her go for help until daylight."Helen forced her brother back to his couch, and returned to help thewounded man, who grew incoherent and began to babble.A little later, when the Kid seemed stronger and his head clearer,Helen ventured to tell him of their uncle's villany and of the proofshe held, with her hope of restoring justice. She told him of theattack planned that very night and of the danger which threatened theminers. He questioned her closely and, realizing the bearing of herstory, crept to the door, casting the wind like a hound."We'll have to risk it," said he. "The wind is almost gone and it's notlong till daylight."She pleaded to go alone, but he was firm. "I'll never leave you again,and, moreover, I know the lower trail quite well. We'll go down thegulch to the valley and reach town that way. It's farther but it's notso dangerous.""You can't ride," she insisted."I can if you'll tie me into the saddle. Come, get the horses."It was still pitchy dark and the rain was pouring, but the wind onlysighed weakly as though tired by its violence when she helped theBronco into his saddle. The effort wrenched a groan from him, but heinsisted upon her tying his feet beneath the horse's belly, saying thatthe trail was rough and he could take no chance of falling again; so,having performed the last services she might for Struve, she mountedher own animal and allowed it to pick its way down the steep descentbehind her brother, who swayed and lurched drunkenly in his seat,gripping the horn before him with both hands. They had been gone perhaps a half-hour when another horse plungedfuriously out of the darkness and halted before the road-house door.Its rider, mud-stained and dishevelled, flung himself in mad haste tothe ground and bolted in through the door. He saw the signs ofconfusion in the outer room, chairs upset and broken, the table wedgedagainst the stove, and before the counter a shattered lamp in a pool ofoil. He called loudly, but, receiving no answer, snatched a lightwhich, he found burning and ran to the door at his left. Nothinggreeted him but the empty tiers of bunks. Turning, he crossed to theother side and burst through. Another lamp was lighted beside the couchwhere Struve lay, breathing heavily, his lids half closed over hisstaring eyes. Roy noted the pool of blood at his feet and the brokenwindow; then, setting down his lamp, he leaned over the man and spoketo him.When he received no answer he spoke again loudly. Then, in a frenzy,Glenister shook the wounded man cruelly, so that he cried out in terror:"I'm dying--oh, I'm dying." Roy raised the sick man up and thrust hisown face before his eyes."This is Glenister. I've come for Helen--where is she?" A spark ofrecognition flickered into the dull stare."You're too late--I'm dying--and I'm afraid."His questioner shook Struve again. "Where is she?" he repeated, timeafter time, till by very force of his own insistence he compelledrealization in the sufferer."The Kid took her away. The Kid shot me," and then his voice rose tillit flooded the room with terror. "The Kid shot me and I'm dying." Hecoughed blood to his lips, at which Roy laid him back and stood up. Sothere was no mistake, after all, and he had arrived too late. This wasthe Kid's revenge. This was how he struck. Lacking courage to face aman's level eyes, he possessed the foulness to prey upon a woman. Royfelt a weakening physical sickness sweep over him till his eye fellupon a sodden garment which Helen had removed from her brother'sshoulders and replaced with a dry one. He snatched it from the floorand in a sudden fury felt it come apart in his hands like wettissue-paper.He found himself out in the rain, scanning the trampled soil by lightof his lamp, and discerned tracks which the drizzle had not yet erased.He reasoned mechanically that the two riders could have no great startof him, so strode out beyond the house to see if they had gone fartherinto the hills. There were no tracks here, therefore they must havedoubled back towards town. It did not occur to him that they might haveleft the beaten path and followed down the little creek to the river;but, replacing the light where he had found it, he remounted and lashedhis horse into a stiff canter up towards the divide that lay betweenhim and the city. The story was growing plainer to him, though as yethe could not piece it all together. Its possibilities stabbed him withsuch horror that he cried out aloud and beat his steed into faster timewith both hands and feet. To think of those two ruffians fighting overthis girl as though she were the spoils of pillage! He must overtakethe Kid--he WOULD! The possibility that he might not threw him intosuch ungovernable mental chaos that he was forced to calm himself. Menwent mad that way. He could not think of it. That gasping creature inthe road-house spoke all too well of the Bronco's determination. Andyet, who of those who had known the Kid in the past would dream thathis vileness was so utter as this?Away to the right, hidden among the shadowed hills, his friends restedthemselves for the coming battle, waiting impatiently his return, andtiming it to the rising sun. Down in the valley to his left were thetwo he followed, while he, obsessed and unreasoning, now cursing like amadman, now grim and silent, spurred southward towards town and intothe ranks of his enemies.CHAPTER XXITHE HAMMER-LOCKDay was breaking as Glenister came down the mountain. With the firstlight he halted to scan the trail, and having no means of knowing thatthe fresh tracks he found were not those of the two riders he followed,he urged his lathered horse ahead till he became suddenly consciousthat he was very tired and had not slept for two days and nights. Therecollection did not reassure the young man, for his body was a weaponwhich must not fail in the slightest measure now that there was work todo. Even the unwelcome speculation upon his physical handicap offeredrelief, however, from the agony which fed upon him whenever he thoughtof Helen in the gambler's hands. Meanwhile, the horse, groaning at hismaster's violence, plunged onward towards the roofs of Nome, nowgrowing gray in the first dawn.It seemed years since Roy had seen the sunlight, for this night,burdened with suspense, had been endlessly long. His body was faintbeneath the strain, and yet he rode on and on, tired, dogged, stony,his eyes set towards the sea, his mind a storm of formless, whirlingthoughts, beneath which was an undeviating, implacable determination.He knew now that he had sacrificed all hope of the Midas, and likewisethe hope of Helen was gone; in fact, he began to realize dimly thatfrom the beginning he had never had the possibility of winning her,that she had never been destined for him, and that his love for her hadbeen sent as a light by which he was to find himself. He had failedeverywhere, he had become an outlaw, he had fought and gone down,certain only of his rectitude and the mastery of his unruly spirit. Nowthe hour had come when he would perform his last mission, derivingtherefrom that satisfaction which the gods could not deny. He wouldhave his vengeance.The scheme took form without conscious effort on his part and embracedtwo things--the death of the gambler and a meeting with McNamara. Ofthe former, he had no more doubt than that the sun rising there wouldsink in the west. So well confirmed was this belief that the detailsdid not engage his thought; but on the result of the other encounter hespeculated with some interest. From the first McNamara had been ariddle to him, and mystery breeds curiosity. His blind, instinctivehatred of the man had assumed the proportions of a mania; but as towhat the outcome would be when they met face to face, fate alone couldtell. Anyway, McNamara should never have Helen--Roy believed hismission covered that point as well as her deliverance from the BroncoKid. When he had finished--he would pay the price. If he had the luckto escape, he would go back to his hills and his solitude; if he didnot, his future would be in the hands of his enemies.He entered the silent streets unobserved, for the mists were heavy andlow. Smoke columns arose vertically in the still air. The rain hadceased, having beaten down the waves which rumbled against the beach,filling the streets with their subdued thunder. A ship, anchored in theoffing, had run in from the lee of Sledge Island with the first lull,while midway to the shore a tender was rising and falling, its oarsflashing like the silvered feelers of a sea insect crawling upon thesurface of the ocean.He rode down Front Street heedless of danger, heedless of the commenthis appearance might create, and, unseen, entered his enemy'sstronghold. He passed a gambling-hall, through the windows of whichcame a sickly yellow gleam. A man came out unsteadily and stared at thehorseman, then passed on.Glenister's plan was to go straight to the Northern and from there totrack down its owner relentlessly, but in order to reach the place hiscourse led him past the office of Dunham & Struve. This brought back tohis mind the man dying out there ten miles at his back. The scantiesthumanity demanded that assistance be sent at once. Yet he dared notgive word openly, thus betraying his presence, for it was necessarythat he maintain his liberty during the next hour at all hazards. Hesuddenly thought of an expedient and reined in his horse, which stoppedwith wide-spread legs and dejected head while he dismounted and climbedthe stairs to leave a note upon the door. Some one would see themessage shortly and recognize its urgency.In dressing for the battle at the Midas on the previous night he hadreplaced his leather boots with "mukluks," which are waterproof, light,and pliable footgear made from the skin of seal and walrus. He was thusable to move as noiselessly as though in moccasins. Finding neitherpencil nor paper in his pocket, he tried the outer door of the office,to find it unlocked. He stepped inside and listened, then moved towardsa table on which were writing materials, but in doing so heard a rustlein Struve's private office. Evidently his soft soles had not disturbedthe man inside. Roy was about to tiptoe out as he had come when thehidden man cleared his throat. It is in these involuntary sounds thatthe voice retains its natural quality more distinctly even than inspeaking, A strange eagerness grew in Glenister's face and heapproached the partition stealthily. It was of wood and glass, thepanes clouded and opaque to a height of some six feet; but steppingupon a chair he peered into the room beyond. A man knelt in a litter ofpapers before the open safe, its drawers and compartments removed andtheir contents scattered. The watcher lowered himself, drew his gun,and laid soft hand upon the door-knob, turning the latch with firmfingers. His vengeance had come to meet him. After lying in wait during the long night, certain that theVigilantes would spring his trap, McNamara was astounded at news of thebattle at the Midas and of Glenister's success. He stormed and cursedhis men as cowards. The Judge became greatly exercised over this newdevelopment, which, coupled with his night of long anxiety, reduced himto a pitiful hysteria."They'll blow us up next. Great Heavens! Dynamite! Oh, that isbarbarous. For Heaven's sake, get the soldiers out, Alec.""Ay, we can use them now." Thereupon McNamara roused the commandingofficer at the post and requested him to accoutre a troop and have themready to march at daylight, then bestirred the Judge to start thewheels of his court and invoke this military aid in regular fashion."Make it all a matter of record," he said. "We want to keep our skirtsclear from now on.""But the towns-people are against us," quavered Stillman. "They'll tearus to pieces.""Let 'em try. Once I get my hand on the ringleader, the rest may riotand be damned."Although he had made less display than had the Judge, the receiver wasno less deeply worried about Helen, of whom no news came. His jealousy,fanned to red heat by the discovery of her earlier defection, wasenhanced fourfold by the thought of this last adventure. Something toldhim there was treachery afoot, and when she did not return at dawn hebegan to fear that she had cast in her lot with the rioters. Thisaroused a perfect delirium of doubt and anger till he reasoned furtherthat Struve, having gone with her, must also be a traitor. Herecognized the menace in this fact, knowing the man's venality, sobegan to reckon carefully its significance. What could Struve do? Whatproof had he? McNamara started, and, seizing his hat, hurried straightto the lawyer's office and let himself in with the key he carried. Itwas light enough for him to decipher the characters on the safe lock ashe turned the combination, so he set to work scanning the endlessbundles within, hoping that after all the man had taken with him noincriminating evidence. Once the searcher paused at some fancied sound,but when nothing came of it drew his revolver and laid it before himjust inside the safe door and close beneath his hand, continuing to runthrough the documents while his uneasiness increased. He had beenengaged so for some time when he heard the faintest creak at his back,too slight to alarm and just sufficient to break his tension and causehim to jerk his head about. Framed in the open door stood Roy Glenisterwatching him.McNamara's astonishment was so genuine that he leaped to his feet,faced about, and prompted by a secretive instinct swung to the safedoor as though to guard its contents. He had acted upon the impulsebefore realizing that his weapon was inside and that now, although thedoor was not locked, it would require that one dangerous, yes, fatal,second to open it.The two men stared at each other for a time, silent and malignant,their glances meeting like blades; in the older man's face a look ofdefiance, in the younger's a dogged and grim-purposed enmity.McNamara's first perturbation left him calm, alert, dangerous; whereasthe continued contemplation of his enemy worked in Glenister to destroyhis composure, and his purpose blazed forth unhidden.He stood there unkempt and soiled, the clean sweep of jaw and throatovergrown with a three days' black stubble, his hair wet and matted,his whole left side foul with clay where he had fallen in the darkness.A muddy red streak spread downward from a cut above his temple, beneathhis eyes were sagging folds, while the flicker at his mouth cornersbetrayed the high nervous pitch to which he was keyed."I have come for the last act, McNamara; now we'll have it out, man toman."The politician shrugged his shoulders. "You have the drop on me. I amunarmed." At which the miner's face lighted fiercely and he chuckled."Ah, that's almost too good to be true. I have dreamed about such athing and I have been hungry to feel your throat since the first time Isaw you. It's grown on me till shooting wouldn't satisfy me. Ever hadthe feeling? Well, I'm going to choke the life out of you with my barehands."McNamara squared himself."I wouldn't advise you to try it. I have lived longer than you and Iwas never beaten, but I know the feeling you speak about. I have itnow."His eyes roved rapidly up and down the other's form, noting the leanthighs and close-drawn belt which lent the appearance of spareness,belied only by the neck and shoulders. He had beaten better men, and hereasoned that if it came to a physical test in these cramped quartershis own great weight would more than offset any superior agility theminer might possess. The longer he looked the more he yielded to hishatred of the man before him, and the more cruelly he longed to satisfyit."Take off your coat," said Glenister. "Now turn around. All right! Ijust wanted to see if you were lying about your gun.""I'll kill you," cried McNamara.Glenister laid his six-shooter upon the safe and slipped off his ownwet garment. The difference was more marked now and the advantage morestrongly with the receiver. Though they had avoided allusion to it,each knew that this fight had nothing to do with the Midas and eachrealized whence sprang their fierce enmity. And it was meet that theyshould come together thus. It had been the one certain and logicalevent which they had felt inevitably approaching from long back. And itwas fitting, moreover, that they should fight alone and unwitnessed,armed only with the weapons of the wilderness, for they were both ofthe far, free lands, were both of the fighter's type, and had bothwarred for the first, great prize.They met ferociously. McNamara aimed a fearful blow, but Glenister methim squarely, beating him off cleverly, stepping in and out, his armsswinging loosely from his shoulders like whalebone withes tipped withlead. He moved lightly, his footing made doubly secure by reason of hissoft-soled mukluks. Recognizing his opponent's greater weight, heundertook merely to stop the headlong rushes and remain out of reach aslong as possible. He struck the politician fairly in the mouth so thatthe man's head snapped back and his fists went wild, then, before thearms could grasp him, the miner had broken ground and whipped anotherblow across; but McNamara was a boxer himself, so covered and blockedit. The politician spat through his mashed lips and rushed again,sweeping his opponent from his feet. Again Glenister's fist shotforward like a lump of granite, but the other came on head down and theblow finished too high, landing on the big man's brow. A sudden dartingagony paralyzed Roy's hand, and he realized that he had broken themetacarpal bones and that henceforth it would be useless. Before hecould recover, McNamara had passed under his extended arm and seizedhim by the middle, then, thrusting his left leg back of Roy's, hewhirled him from his balance, flinging him clear and with resistlessforce. It seemed that a fatal fall must follow, but the youth squirmedcatlike in the air, landing with set muscles which rebounded likerubber. Even so, the receiver was upon him before he could rise,reaching for the young man's throat with his heavy hands. Royrecognized the fatal "strangle hold," and, seizing his enemy's wrists,endeavored to tear them apart, but his left hand was useless, so with amighty wrench he freed himself, and, locked in each other's arms, themen strained and swayed about the office till their neck veins werebursting, their muscles paralyzed.Men may fight duels calmly, may shoot or parry or thrust with colddeliberation; but when there comes the jar of body to body, the sweatycontact of skin to skin, the play of iron muscles, the painful gasp ofexhaustion--then the mind goes skittering back into its dark recesseswhile every venomous passion leaps forth from its hiding-place andjoins in the horrid war.They tripped across the floor, crashing into the partition, whichsplit, showering them with glass. They fell and rolled in it; then, byconsent, wrenched themselves apart and rose, eye to eye, their jawshanging, their lungs wheezing, their faces trickling blood and sweat.Roy's left hand pained him excruciatingly, while McNamara's maceratedlips had turned outward in a hideous pout. They crouched so for aninstant, cruel, bestial--then clinched again. The office-fittings werewrecked utterly and the room became a litter of ruins. The men'sgarments fell away till their breasts were bare and their arms swelledwhite and knotted through the rags. They knew no pain, their bodieswere insensate mechanisms.Gradually the older man's face was beaten into a shapeless mass by theother's cunning blows, while Glenister's every bone was wrenched andtwisted under his enemy's terrible onslaughts. The miner's chiefeffort, it is true, was to keep his feet and to break the man'sembraces. Never had he encountered one whom he could not beat by sheerstrength till he met this great, snarling creature who worried himhither and yon as though he were a child. Time and again Roy beat uponthe man's face with the blows of a sledge. No rules governed thissolitary combat; the men were deaf to all but the roaring in theirears, blinded to all but hate, insensible to everything but the bloodmania. Their trampling feet caused the building to rumble and shake asthough some monster were running amuck.Meanwhile a bareheaded man rushed out of the store beneath, bumpinginto a pedestrian who had paused on the sidewalk, and together theyscurried up the stairs. The dory which Roy had seen at sea had shot thebreakers, and now its three passengers were tracking through the wetsand towards Front Street, Bill Wheaton in the lead. He was followed bytwo rawboned men who travelled without baggage. The city was awakeningwith the sun which reared a copper rim out of the sea--Judge Stillmanand Voorhees came down from the hotel and paused to gaze through themists at a caravan of mule teams which trotted into the other end ofthe street with jingle and clank. The wagons were blue with soldiers,the early golden rays slanting from their Krags, and they were boundfor the Midas.Out of the fogs which clung so thickly to the tundra there came twoother horses, distorted and unreal, on one a girl, on the other afigure of pain and tragedy, a grotesque creature that swayed stiffly tothe motion of its steed, its face writhed into lines of suffering, itshands clutching cantle and horn.It was as though Fate, with invisible touch, were setting her stage forthe last act of this play, assembling the principals close to theGolden Sands where first they had made entrance.The man and the girl came face to face with the Judge and marshal, whocried out upon seeing them, but as they reined in, out from the stairsbeside them a man shot amid clatter and uproar."Give me a hand--quick!" he shouted to them."What's up?" inquired the marshal."It's murder! McNamara and Glenister!" He dashed back up the stepsbehind Voorhees, the Judge following, while muffled cries came fromabove.The gambler turned towards the three men who were hurrying from thebeach, and, recognizing Wheaton, called to him: "Untie my feet! Cut theropes! Quick!""What's the trouble?" the lawyer asked, but on hearing Glenister's namebounded after the Judge, leaving one of his companions to free therider. They could hear the fight now, and all crowded towards the door,Helen with her brother, in spite of his warning to stay behind.She never remembered how she climbed those stairs, for she was bornealong by that hypnotic power which drags one to behold a catastrophe inspite of his will. Reaching the room, she stood appalled; for the groupshe had joined watched two raging things that rushed at each other withinhuman cries, ragged, bleeding, fighting on a carpet of debris. Everyloose and breakable thing had been ground to splinters as though byiron slugs in a whirling cylinder.To this day, from Dawson to the Straits, from Unga to the Arctics, mentell of the combat wherever they foregather at flaring camp-fires or indingy bunkhouses; and although some scout the tale, there are otherswho saw it and can swear to its truth. These say that the encounter waslike the battle of bull moose in the rutting season, though moreterrible, averring that two men like these had never been known in theland since the days of Vitus Bering and his crew; for their rancor hadswollen till at feel of each other's flesh they ran mad and feltsuperhuman strength. It is true, at any rate, that neither wasconscious of the filling room, nor the cries of the crowd, even whenthe marshal forced himself through the wedged door and fell upon thenearest, which was Glenister. He came at an instant when the two hadpaused at arm's-length, glaring with rage-drunken eyes, gasping thelabored breath back into their lungs.With a fling of his long arms the young man hurled the intruder asideso violently that his head struck the iron safe and he collapsedinsensible. Then, without apparent notice of the interruption, thefight went on. It was seen during this respite that McNamara's mouthwas running water as though he were deathly sick, while every retchbrought forth a groan. Helen heard herself crying: "Stop them! Stopthem!" But no one seemed capable of interference. She heard her brothermuttering and his breath coming heavily like that of the fighters, hisbody swaying in time to theirs. The Judge was ashy, imbecile, helpless.McNamara's distress was patent to his antagonist, who advanced upon himwith the hunger of promised victory; but the young man's muscles obeyedhis commands sluggishly, his ribs seemed broken, his back was weak, andon the inner side of his legs the flesh was quivering. As they cametogether the boss reached up his right hand and caught the miner by theface, burying thumb and fingers crab like into his cheeks, forcing hisslack jaws apart, thrusting his head backward, while he centred everyounce of his strength in the effort to maim. Roy felt the flesh givingway and flung himself backward to break the hold, whereupon the othersummoned his wasting energy and plunged towards the safe, where lay therevolver. Instinct warned Glenister of treachery, told him that the manhad sought this last resource to save himself, and as he saw him turnhis back and reach for the weapon, the youth leaped like a panther,seizing him about the waist, grasping McNamara's wrist with his righthand. For the first time during the combat they were not face to face,and on the instant Roy realized the advantage given him through theother's perfidy, realized the wrestler's hold that was his, and knewthat the moment of victory was come.The telling takes much time, but so quickly had these things happenedthat the footsteps of the soldiers had not yet reached the door whenthe men were locked beside the safe.Of what happened next many garbled accounts have gone forth, for of allthose present, none but the Bronco Kid knew its significance and everrecounted the truth concerning it. Some claim that the younger man wasseized with a fear of death which multiplied his enormous strength,others that the power died in his adversary as reward for his treason;but it was not so.No sooner had Roy encompassed McNamara's waist from the rear than heslid his damaged hand up past the other's chest and around the back ofhis neck, thus bringing his own left arm close under his enemy's leftarmpit, wedging the receiver's head forward, while with his other handhe grasped the politician's right wrist close to the revolver, thusholding him in a grasp which could not be broken. Now came the test.The two bodies set themselves rocklike and rigid. There was no lungingabout. Calling up the final atom of his strength, Glenister borebackward with his right arm and it became a contest for the weaponwhich, clutched in the two hands, swayed back and forth or darted upand down, the fury of resistance causing it to trace formless patternsin the air with its muzzle. McNamara shook himself, but he was closeagainst the safe and could not escape, his head bowed forward by thelock of the miner's left arm, and so he strained till the breathclogged in his throat. Despite the grievous toil his right hand movedback slightly. His feet shifted a bit, while the blood seemed burstingfrom his eyes, but he found that the long fingers encircling his wristwere like gyves weighted with the strength of the hills and theirresistible vigor of youth which knew no defeat. Slowly, inch by inch,the great man's arm was dragged back, down past his side, while thestrangling labor of his breath showed at what awful cost. The muzzle ofthe gun described a semicircle and the knotted hands began to traveltowards the left, more rapidly now, across his broad back. Still hestruggled and wrenched, but uselessly. He strove to fire the weapon,but his fingers were woven about it so that the hammer would not work.Then the miner began forcing upward.The white skin beneath the men's strips of clothing was stretched overgreat knots and ridges which sunk and swelled and quivered. Helen,watching in silent terror, felt her brother sinking his fingers intoher shoulder and heard him panting, his face ablaze with excitement,while she became conscious that he had repeated time and again:"It's the hammer-lock--the hammer-lock."By now McNamara's arm was bent and cramped upon his back, and then theysaw Glenister's shoulder dip, his elbow come closer to his side, andhis body heave in one final terrific effort as though pushing a heavyweight. In the silence something snapped like a stick. There came adeafening report and the scream of a strong man overcome with agony.McNamara went to his knees and sagged forward on to his face as thoughevery bone in his huge bulk had turned to water, while his masterreeled back against the opposite wall, his heels dragging in thelitter, bringing up with outflung arms as though fearful of falling,swaying, blind, exhausted, his face blackened by the explosion of therevolver, yet grim with the light of victory.Judge Stillman shouted, hysterically:"Arrest that man, quick! Don't let him go!"It was the miner's first realization that others were there. Raisinghis head he stared at the faces close against the partition, thengroaned the words:"I beat the traitor and--and--I broke him with--my hands!"CHAPTER XXIITHE PROMISE OF DREAMSSoldiers seized the young man, who made no offer at resistance, and theroom became a noisy riot. Crowds surged up from below, clamoring,questioning, till some one at the head of the stairs shouted down:"They've got Roy Glenister. He's killed McNamara," at which a murmurarose that threatened to become a cheer.Then one of the receiver's faction called: "Let's hang him. He killedten of our men last night." Helen winced, but Stillman, roused to asort of malevolent courage, quieted the angry voices."Officer, hold these people back. I'll attend to this man. The law's inmy hands and I'll make him answer."McNamara reared himself groaning from the floor, his right arm swingingfrom the shoulder strangely loose and distorted, with palm twistedoutward, while his battered face was hideous with pain and defeat. Hegrowled broken maledictions at his enemy.Roy, meanwhile, said nothing, for as the savage lust died in him herealized that the whirling faces before him were the faces of hisenemies, that the Bronco Kid was still at large, and that his vengeancewas but half completed. His knees were bending, his limbs were likeleaden bars, his chest a furnace of coals. As he reeled down the laneof human forms, supported by his guards, he came abreast of the girland her companion and paused, clearing his vision slowly."Ah, there you are!" he said, thickly, to the gambler, and began towrestle with his captors, baring his teeth in a grimace of painfuleffort; but they held him as easily as though he were a child and drewhim forward, his body sagging limply, his face turned back over hisshoulder.They had him near the door when Wheaton barred their way, crying: "Holdup a minute--it's all right, Roy--""Ay, Bill--it's all right. We did our--best, but we were done by adamned blackguard. Now he'll send me up--but I don't care. I brokehim--with my naked hands. Didn't I, McNamara?" He mocked unsteadily atthe boss, who cursed aloud in return, glowering like an evil mask,while Stillman ran up dishevelled and shrilly irascible."Take him away, I tell you! Take him to jail."But Wheaton held his place while the room centred its eyes upon him,scenting some unexpected denouement. He saw it, and in concession to anatural vanity and dramatic instinct, he threw back his head andstuffed his hands into his coat-pockets while the crowd waited. Hegrinned insolently at the Judge and the receiver."This will be a day of defeats and disappointments to you, my friends.That boy won't go to jail because you will wear the shacklesyourselves. Oh, you played a shrewd game, you two, with your senators,your politics, and your pulls; but it's our turn now, and we'll makeyou dance for the mines you gutted and the robberies you've done andthe men you've ruined. Thank Heaven there's ONE honest court and Ihappened to find it." He turned to the strangers who had accompaniedhim from the ship, crying, "Serve those warrants," and they steppedforward.The uproar of the past few minutes had brought men running from everydirection till, finding no room on the stairs, they had massed in thestreet below while the word flew from lip to lip concerning thisclosing scene of their drama, the battle at the Midas, the great fightup-stairs, and the arrest by the 'Frisco deputies. Like Sindbad'sgenie, a wondrous tale took shape from the rumors. Men shouldered oneanother eagerly for a glimpse of the actors, and when the pressstreamed out, greeted it with volleys of questions. They saw theunconscious marshal borne forth, followed by the old Judge, now apalsied wretch, slinking beside his captor, a very shell of a man atwhom they jeered. When McNamara lurched into view, an image of defeatand chagrin, their voices rose menacingly. The pack was turning and heknew it, but, though racked and crippled, he bent upon them a visage sofull of defiance and contemptuous malignity that they hushedthemselves, and their final picture of him was that of a big mandowned, but unbeaten to the last. They began to cry for Glenister, sothat when he loomed in the doorway, a ragged, heroic figure, his heavyshock low over his eyes, his unshaven face aggressive even in itsweariness, his corded arms and chest bare beneath the flutteringstreamers, the street broke into wild cheering. Here was a man of theirown, a son of the Northland who labored and loved and fought in a waythey understood, and he had come into his due.But Roy, dumb and listless, staggered up the street, refusing the helpof every man except Wheaton. He heard his companion talking, butgrasped only that the attorney gloated and gloried."We have whipped them, boy. We have whipped them at their own game.Arrested in their very door-yards--cited for contempt of court--that'swhat they are. They disobeyed those other writs, and so I got them.""I broke his arm," muttered the miner."Yes, I saw you do it! Ugh! it was an awful thing. I couldn't proveconspiracy, but they'll go to jail for a little while just the same,and we have broken the ring.""It snapped at the shoulder," the other continued, dully, "just like ashovel handle. I felt it--but he tried to kill me and I had to do it."The attorney took Roy to his cabin and dressed his wounds, talkingincessantly the while, but the boy was like a sleep-walker, displayingno elation, no excitement, no joy of victory. At last Wheaton broke out:"Cheer up! Why, man, you act like a loser. Don't you realize that we'vewon? Don't you understand that the Midas is yours? And the whole worldwith it?""Won?" echoed the miner. "What do you know about it, Bill? TheMidas--the world--what good are they? You're wrong. I'velost--yes--I've lost everything she taught me, and by some damned trickof Fate she was there to see me do it. Now, go away; I want to sleep."He sank upon the bed with its tangle of blankets and was unconsciousbefore the lawyer had covered him over.There he lay like a dead man till late in the afternoon, when Dextryand Slapjack came in from the hills, answering Wheaton's call, and fellupon him hungrily. They shook Roy into consciousness with joyous riot,pommelling him with affectionate roughness till he rose and joined withthem stiffly. He bathed and rubbed the soreness from his muscles,emerging physically fit. They made him recount his adventures to thetiniest detail, following his description of the fight with absorbedinterest till Dextry broke into mournful complaint:"I'd have give my half of the Midas to see you bust him. Lord, I'd havescreeched with soopreme delight at that.""Why didn't you gouge his eyes out when you had him crippled?"questioned Slapjack, vindictively. "I'd 'a' done it."Dextry continued: "They tell me that when he was arrested he swore ineighteen different languages, each one more refreshin'ly repulsive an'vig'rous than the precedin'. Oh, I have sure missed a-plenty to-day,partic'lar because my own diction is gettin' run down an' skim-milky oflate, showin' sad lack of new idees. Which I might have assim'latedsomethin' robustly original an' expressive if I'd been here. No, sir; anose-bag full of nuggets wouldn't have kept me away.""How did it sound when she busted?" insisted the morbid Simms, butGlenister refused to discuss his combat."Come on, Slap," said the old prospector, "let's go down-town. I'm sohet up I can't set still, an' besides, mebbe we can get the story theway it really happened, from somebody who ain't bound an' gagged an'chloroformed by such unbecomin' modesties. Roy, don't never go intovawdyville with them personal episodes, because they read about asthrillin' as a cook-book. Why, say, I've had the story of that fightfrom four different fellers already, none of which was within fourblocks of the scrimmage, an' they're all diff'rent an' all better 'nyour account."Now that Glenister's mind had recovered some of its poise he realizedwhat he had done."I was a beast, an animal," he groaned, "and that after all mystriving. I wanted to leave that part behind, I wanted to be worthy ofher love and trust even though I never won it, but at the first test Iam found lacking. I have lost her confidence, yes--and what is worse,infinitely worse, I have lost my own. She's always seen me at myworst," he went on, "but I'm not that kind at bottom, not that kind. Iwant to do what's right, and if I have another chance I will, I know Iwill. I've been tried too hard, that's all."Some one knocked, and he opened the door to admit the Bronco Kid andHelen."Wait a minute, old man," said the Kid. "I'm here as a friend." Thegambler handled himself with difficulty, offering in explanation:"I'm all sewed up in bandages of one kind or another.""He ought to be in bed now, but he wouldn't let me come alone, and Icould not wait," the girl supplemented, while her eyes avoidedGlenister's in strange hesitation."He wouldn't let you. I don't understand.""I'm her brother," announced the Bronco Kid. "I've known it for a longtime, but I--I--well, you understand I couldn't let her know. All I cansay is, I've gambled square till the night I played you, and I was asmad as a dervish then, blaming you for the talk I'd heard. Last night Ilearned by chance about Struve and Helen and got to the road-house intime to save her. I'm sorry I didn't kill him." His long white fingerswrithed about the arm of his chair at the memory."Isn't he dead?" Glenister inquired."No. The doctors have brought him in and he'll get well. He's like halfthe men in Alaska--here because the sheriffs back home couldn't shootstraight. There's something else. I'm not a good talker, but give metime and I'll manage it so you'll understand. I tried to keep Helenfrom coming on this errand, but she said it was the square thing andshe knows better than I. It's about those papers she brought in lastspring. She was afraid you might consider her a party to the deal, butyou don't, do you?" He glared belligerently, and Roy replied, withfervor:"Certainly not. Go on.""Well, she learned the other day that those documents told the wholestory and contained enough proof to break up this conspiracy andconvict the Judge and McNamara and all the rest, but Struve kept thebundle in his safe and wouldn't give it up without a price. That's whyshe went away with him--She thought it was right, and--that's all. Butit seems Wheaton had succeeded in another way. Now, I'm coming to thepoint. The Judge and McNamara are arrested for contempt of court andthey're as good as convicted; you have recovered your mine, and thesemen are disgraced. They will go to jail--""Yes, for six months, perhaps," broke in the other, hotly, "but whatdoes that amount to? There never was a bolder crime consummated nor onemore cruelly unjust. They robbed a realm and pillaged its people, theydefiled a court and made Justice a wanton, they jailed good men andsent others to ruin; and for this they are to suffer--how? By a paltryfine or a short imprisonment, perhaps, by an ephemeral disgrace and theloss of their stolen goods. Contempt of court is the accusation, butyou might as well convict a murderer for breach of the peace. We'vethrown them off, it's true, and they won't trouble us again, butthey'll never have to answer for their real infamy. That will gounpunished while their lawyers quibble over technicalities and rules ofcourt. I guess it's true that there isn't any law of God or man northof Fifty-three; but if there is justice south of that mark, thosepeople will answer for conspiracy and go to the penitentiary.""You make it hard for me to say what I want to. I am almost sorry wecame, for I am not cunning with words, and I don't know that you'llunderstand," said the Bronco Kid, gravely, "We looked at it this way:you have had your victory, you have beaten your enemies against odds,you have recovered your mine, and they are disgraced. To men like themthat last will outlive and outweigh all the rest; but the Judge is ouruncle and our blood runs in his veins. He took Helen when she was ababy and was a father to her in his selfish way, loving her as best heknew how. And she loves him.""I don't quite understand you," said Roy.And then Helen spoke for the first time eagerly, taking a packet fromher bosom as she began:"This will tell the whole wretched story, Mr. Glenister, and show theplot in all its vileness. It's hard for me to betray my uncle, but thisproof is yours by right to use as you see fit, and I can't keep it.""Do you mean that this evidence will show all that? And you're going togive it to me because you think it is your duty?""It belongs to you. I have no choice. But what I came for was to pleadand to ask a little mercy for my uncle, who is an old, old man, andvery weak. This will kill him."He saw that her eyes were swimming while the little chin quivered everso slightly and her pale cheeks were flushed. There rose in him the oldwild desire to take her in his arms, a yearning to pillow her head onhis shoulder and kiss away the tears, to smooth with tender caress thewavy hair, and bury his face deep in it till he grew drunk with themadness of her. But he knew at last for whom she really pleaded.So he was to forswear this vengeance, which was no vengeance after all,but in verity a just punishment. They asked him--a man--a man's man--aNorthman--to do this, and for what? For no reward, but on the contraryto insure himself lasting bitterness. He strove to look at theproposition calmly, clearly, but it was difficult. If only by freeingthis other villain as well as her uncle he would do a good to her, thenhe would not hesitate. Love was not the only thing. He marvelled at hisown attitude; this could not be his old self debating thus. He hadasked for another chance to show that he was not the old Roy Glenister;well, it had come, and he was ready.Roy dared not look at Helen any more, for this was the hardest momenthe had ever lived."You ask this for your uncle, but what of--of the other fellow? Youmust know that if one goes free so will they both; they can't beseparated.""It's almost too much to ask," the Kid took up, uncertainly. "But don'tyou think the work is done? I can't help but admire McNamara, andneither can you--he's been too good an enemy to you forthat--and--and--he loves Helen.""I know--I know," said Glenister, hastily, at the same time stopping anunintelligible protest from the girl. "You've said enough." Hestraightened his slightly stooping shoulders and looked at the unopenedpackage wearily, then slipped the rubber band from it, and, separatingthe contents, tore them up--one by one--tore them into fine bitswithout hurry or ostentation, and tossed the fragments away, while thewoman began to sob softly, the sound of her relief alone disturbing thesilence. And so he gave her his enemy, making his offer gamely,according to his code."You're right--the work is done. And now, I'm very tired."They left him standing there, the glory of the dying day illumining hislean, brown features, the vision of a great loneliness in his wearyeyes.He did not rouse himself till the sky before him was only a curtain ofsteel, pencilled with streaks of soot that lay close down above thedarker sea. Then he sighed and said, aloud:"So this is the end, and I gave him to her with these hands"--he heldthem out before him curiously, becoming conscious for the first timethat the left one was swollen and discolored and fearfully painful. Henoted it with impersonal interest, realizing its need of medicalattention--so left the cabin and walked down into the city. Heencountered Dextry and Simms on the way, and they went with him, bothflowing with the gossip of the camp."Lord, but you're the talk of the town," they began. "The curio huntershave commenced to pull Struve's office apart for souvenirs, and theSwedes want to run you for Congress as soon as ever we get admitted asa State. They say that at collar-an'-elbow holts you could lick any ofthem Eastern senators and thereby rastle out a lot of good legislationfor us cripples up here.""Speakin' of laws goes to show me that this here country is gettin' tooblamed civilized for a white man," said Simms, pessimistically, "andnow that this fight is ended up it don't look like there would beanything doin' fit to claim the interest of a growed-up person for along while. I'm goin' west.""West! Why, you can throw a stone into Bering Strait from here," saidRoy, smiling."Oh, well, the world's round. There's a schooner outfittin' forSibeery--two years' cruise. Me an' Dex is figgerin' on gettin' outtowards the frontier fer a spell.""Sure!" said Dextry. "I'm beginnin' to feel all cramped up hereaboutsowin' to these fillymonarch orchestras an' French restarawnts and suchdiscrepancies of scenery. They're puttin' a pavement on Front Streetand there's a shoe-shinin' parlor opened up. Why, I'd like to get whereI could stretch an' holler without disturbin' the pensiveness of somedude in a dress suit. Better come along, Roy; we can sell out theMidas.""I'll think it over," said the young man.The night was bright with a full moon when they left the doctor'soffice. Roy, in no mood for the exuberance of his companions, partedfrom them, but had not gone far before he met Cherry Malotte. His headwas low and he did not see her till she spoke."Well, boy, so it's over at last!"Her words chimed so perfectly with his thoughts that he replied: "Yes,it's all over, little girl.""You don't need my congratulations--you know me too well for that. Howdoes it feel to be a winner?""I don't know. I've lost.""Lost what?""Everything--except the gold-mine.""Everything except--I see. You mean that she--that you have asked herand she won't?" He never knew the cost at which she held her voice sosteady."More than that. It's so new that it hurts yet, and it will continue tohurt for a long time, I suppose--but to-morrow I am going back to myhills and my valleys, back to the Midas and my work, and try to beginall over. For a time I've wandered in strange paths, seeking new gods,as it were, but the dazzle has died out of my eyes and I can see trueagain. She isn't for me, although I shall always love her. I'm sorry Ican't forget easily, as some do. It's hard to look ahead and take aninterest in things. But what about you? Where shall you go?""I don't know. It doesn't really matter--now." The dusk hid her white,set face and she spoke monotonously. "I am going to see the Bronco Kid.He sent for me. He's ill.""He's not a bad sort," said Roy. "And I suppose he'll make a new start,too.""Perhaps," said she, gazing far out over the gloomy ocean. "It alldepends." After a moment, she added, "What a pity that we can't allsponge off the slate and begin afresh and--forget.""It's part of the game," said he. "I don't know why it's so, but it is.I'll see you sometimes, won't I?""No, boy--I think not.""I believe I understand," he murmured; "and perhaps it's better so." Hetook her two soft hands in his one good right and kissed them. "Godbless you and keep you, dear, brave little Cherry."She stood straight and still as he melted into the shadows, and onlythe moonlight heard her pitiful sob and her hopeless whisper:"Good-bye, my boy, my boy."He wandered down beside the sea, for his battle was not yet won, anduntil he was surer of himself he could not endure the ribaldry andrejoicing of his fellows. A welcome lay waiting for him in every publicplace, but no one there could know the mockery of it, no one couldgauge the desolation that was his.The sand, wet, packed, and hard as a pavement, gave no sound to hiscareless steps; and thus it was that he came silently upon the onewoman as she stood beside the silver surf. Had he seen her first hewould have slunk past in the landward shadows; but, recognizing histall form, she called and he came, while it seemed that his lungs grewsuddenly constricted, as though bound about with steel hoops. The verypleasure of her sight pained him. He advanced eagerly, and yet withhesitation, standing stiffly aloof while his heart fluttered and histongue grew dumb. At last she saw his bandages and her manner changedabruptly. Coming closer she touched them with caressing fingers."It's nothing--nothing at all," he said, while his voice jumped out ofall control. "When are you--going away?""I do not know--not for some time."He had supposed she would go to-morrow with her uncle and--the other,to be with them through their travail.With warm impetuosity she began: "It was a noble thing you did to-day.Oh, I am glad and proud.""I prefer you to think of me in that way, rather than as the wild beastyou saw this morning, for I was mad, perfectly mad with hatred andrevenge, and every wild impulse that comes to a defeated man. You see,I had played and lost, played and lost, again and again, till there wasnothing left. What mischance brought you there? It was a terriblybrutal thing, but you can't understand.""But I can understand. I do. I know all about it now. I know the wildrage of desperation; I know the exultation of victory; I know what hateand fear are now. You told me once that the wilderness had made you asavage, and I laughed at it just as I did when you said that my contactwith big things would teach me the truth, that we're all alike, andthat those motives are in us all. I see now that you were right and Iwas very simple. I learned a great deal last night.""I have learned much also," said he. "I wish you might teach me more.""I--I--don't think I could teach you any more," she hesitated.He moved as though to speak, but held back and tore his eyes away fromher."Well," she inquired, gazing at him covertly."Once, a long time ago, I read a Lover's Petition, and ever sinceknowing you I have made the constant prayer that I might be given thepurity to be worthy the good in you, and that you might be granted thepatience to reach the good in me--but it's no use. But at least I'mglad we have met on common ground, as it were, and that you understand,in a measure. The prayer could not be answered; but through it I havefound myself and--I have known you. That last is worth more than aking's ransom to me. It is a holy thing which I shall reverence always,and when you go you will leave me lonely except for its remembrance.""But I am not going," she said. "That is--unless--"Something in her voice swept his gaze back from the shimmering causewaythat rippled seaward to the rising moon. It brought the breath into histhroat, and he shook as though seized by a great fear."Unless--what?""Unless you want me to.""Oh, God! don't play with me!" He flung out his hand as though to stopher while his voice died out to a supplicating hoarseness. "I can'tstand that.""Don't you see? Won't you see?" she asked. "I was waiting here for thecourage to go to you since you have made it so very hard for me--mypagan." With which she came close to him, looking upward into his face,smiling a little, shrinking a little, yielding yet withholding, whilethe moonlight made of her eyes two bottomless, boundless pools, darkwith love, and brimming with the promise of his dreams.THE ENDEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Spoilers, by Rex Beach***START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TRAIL OF THE GOLDSEEKERS***E-text prepared by Karen Dalrymple and the Project Gutenberg OnlineDistributed Proofreading Team (http://www.pgdp.net) from digital materialgenerously made available by Internet Archive/American Libraries(http://www.archive.org/details/americana)Note: Images of the original pages are available through      Internet Archive/American Libraries.

I will fling the scholar's pen aside,    And grasp once more the bronco's rein,    And I will ride and ride and ride,    Till the rain is snow, and the seed is grain.    The way is long and cold and lone--                But I go.    It leads where pines forever moan            Their weight of snow,                Yet I go.    There are voices in the wind that call,    There are hands that beckon to the plain;    I must journey where the trees grow tall,    And the lonely heron clamors in the rain.    Where the desert flames with furnace heat,                I have trod.    Where the horned toad's tiny feet                In a land                Of burning sand                Leave a mark,    I have ridden in the noon and in the dark.    Now I go to see the snows,    Where the mossy mountains rise    Wild and bleak--and the rose    And pink of morning fill the skies    With a color that is singing,                And the lights                Of polar nights                Utter cries    As they sweep from star to star,                Swinging, ringing,    Where the sunless middays are.THE TRAIL OF THE GOLDSEEKERSCHAPTER ICOMING OF THE SHIPSIA little over a year ago a small steamer swung to at a Seattle wharf,and emptied a flood of eager passengers upon the dock. It was anobscure craft, making infrequent trips round the Aleutian Islands(which form the farthest western point of the United States) to themouth of a practically unknown river called the Yukon, which emptiesinto the ocean near the post of St. Michaels, on the northwesterncoast of Alaska.The passengers on this boat were not distinguished citizens, nor fairto look upon. They were roughly dressed, and some of them were paleand worn as if with long sickness or exhausting toil. Yet this shipand these passengers startled the whole English-speaking world. Swiftas electricity could fly, the magical word GOLD went forth like abrazen eagle across the continent to turn the faces of millions ofearth's toilers toward a region which, up to that time, had beenunknown or of ill report. For this ship contained a million dollarsin gold: these seedy passengers carried great bags of nuggets andbottles of shining dust which they had burned, at risk of theirlives, out of the perpetually frozen ground, so far in the north thatthe winter had no sun and the summer midnight had no dusk.The world was instantly filled with the stories of these men and oftheir tons of bullion. There was a moment of arrested attention--thenthe listeners smiled and nodded knowingly to each other, and wentabout their daily affairs.But other ships similarly laden crept laggardly through the gates ofPuget Sound, bringing other miners with bags and bottles, and thenthe world believed. Thereafter the journals of all Christendom had todo with the "Klondike" and "The Golden River." Men could not hearenough or read enough of the mysterious Northwest.In less than ten days after the landing of the second ship, alltrains westward-bound across America were heavily laden withfiery-hearted adventurers, who set their faces to the new Eldoradowith exultant confidence, resolute to do and dare.Miners from Colorado and cow-boys from Montana met and mingled withcivil engineers and tailors from New York City, and adventurousmerchants from Chicago set shoulder to shoemakers from Lynn. Allkinds and conditions of prospectors swarmed upon the boats atSeattle, Vancouver, and other coast cities. Some entered upon newroutes to the gold fields, which were now known to be far in theYukon Valley, while others took the already well-known route by wayof St. Michaels, and thence up the sinuous and sinister stream whosewaters began on the eastern slope of the glacial peaks just inlandfrom Juneau, and swept to the north and west for more than twothousand miles. It was understood that this way was long and hard andcold, yet thousands eagerly embarked on keels of all designs and ofall conditions of unseaworthiness. By far the greater numberassaulted the mountain passes of Skagway.As the autumn came on, the certainty of the gold deposits deepened;but the tales of savage cliffs, of snow-walled trails, of swift andicy rivers, grew more numerous, more definite, and more appalling.Weak-hearted Jasons dropped out and returned to warn their friends ofthe dread powers to be encountered in the northern mountains.As the uncertainties of the river route and the sufferings and toilsof the Chilcoot and the White Pass became known, the adventurers castabout to find other ways of reaching the gold fields, which had comenow to be called "The Klondike," because of the extreme richness of asmall river of that name which entered the Yukon, well on toward theArctic Circle.From this attempt to avoid the perils of other routes, much talkarose of the Dalton Trail, the Taku Trail, the Stikeen Route, theTelegraph Route, and the Edmonton Overland Trail. Every town withintwo thousand miles of the Klondike River advertised itself as "thepoint of departure for the gold fields," and set forth the specialadvantages of its entrance way, crying out meanwhile against thecruel mendacity of those who dared to suggest other and "moredangerous and costly" ways.The winter was spent in urging these claims, and thousands of menplanned to try some one or the other of these "side-doors." Themovement overland seemed about to surpass the wonderfultranscontinental march of miners in '49 and '50, and those who lovedthe trail for its own sake and were eager to explore an unknowncountry hesitated only between the two trails which were entirelyoverland. One of these led from Edmonton to the head-waters of thePelly, the other started from the Canadian Pacific Railway atAshcroft and made its tortuous way northward between the greatglacial coast range on the left and the lateral spurs of theContinental Divide on the east.The promoters of each of these routes spoke of the beautiful valleysto be crossed, of the lovely streams filled with fish, of the gameand fruit. Each was called "the poor man's route," because with a fewponies and a gun the prospector could traverse the entire distanceduring the summer, "arriving on the banks of the Yukon, not merelybrowned and hearty, but a veteran of the trail."It was pointed out also that the Ashcroft Route led directly acrossseveral great gold districts and that the adventurer could combinebusiness and pleasure on the trip by examining the Ominica country,the Kisgagash Mountains, the Peace River, and the upper waters of theStikeen. These places were all spoken of as if they were closebeside the trail and easy of access, and the prediction was freelymade that a flood of men would sweep up this valley such as had neverbeen known in the history of goldseeking.As the winter wore on this prediction seemed about to be realized. Inevery town in the West, in every factory in the East, men wereorganizing parties of exploration. Grub stakers by the hundred wereoutfitted, a vast army was ready to march in the early spring, when anew interest suddenly appeared--a new army sprang into being.Against the greed for gold arose the lust of battle. WAR came tochange the current of popular interest. The newspapers called hometheir reporters in the North and sent them into the South, the Dakotacow-boys just ready to join the ranks of the goldseekers entered thearmy of the United States, finding in its Southern campaigns anoutlet to their undying passion for adventure; while the factoryhands who had organized themselves into a goldseeking company turnedthemselves into a squad of military volunteers. For the time the goldof the North was forgotten in the war of the South.IIHowever, there were those not so profoundly interested in the war orwhose arrangements had been completed before the actual outbreak ofcannon-shot, and would not be turned aside. An immense army stillpushed on to the north. This I joined on the 20th day of April,leaving my home in Wisconsin, bound for the overland trail andbearing a joyous heart. I believed that I was about to see and takepart in a most picturesque and impressive movement across thewilderness. I believed it to be the last great march of the kindwhich could ever come in America, so rapidly were the wild placesbeing settled up. I wished, therefore, to take part in this tramp ofthe goldseekers, to be one of them, and record their deeds. I wishedto return to the wilderness also, to forget books and theories of artand social problems, and come again face to face with the great freespaces of woods and skies and streams. I was not a goldseeker, but anature hunter, and I was eager to enter this, the wildest region yetremaining in Northern America. I willingly and with joy took the longway round, the hard way through.THE COW-BOY    Of rough rude stock this saddle sprite    Is grosser grown with savage things.    Inured to storms, his fierce delight    Is lawless as the beasts he swings    His swift rope over.--Libidinous, obscene,    Careless of dust and dirt, serene,    He faces snows in calm disdain,    Or makes his bed down in the rain.CHAPTER IIOUTFITTINGWe went to sleep while the train was rushing past the lonelysettler's shacks on the Minnesota Prairies. When we woke we foundourselves far out upon the great plains of Canada. The morning wascold and rainy, and there were long lines of snow in the swales ofthe limitless sod, which was silent, dun, and still, with a majestyof arrested motion like a polar ocean. It was like Dakota as I saw itin 1881. When it was a treeless desolate expanse, swept by owls andhawks, cut by feet of wild cattle, unmarred and unadorned of man. Theclouds ragged, forbidding, and gloomy swept southward as if with aduty to perform. No green thing appeared, all was gray and sombre,and the horizon lines were hid in the cold white mist. Spring wasjust coming on.Our car, which was a tourist sleeper, was filled with goldseekers,some of them bound for the Stikeen River, some for Skagway. While afew like myself had set out for Teslin Lake by way of "The PrairieRoute." There were women going to join their husbands at Dawson City,and young girls on their way to Vancouver and Seattle, and wholefamilies emigrating to Washington.By the middle of the forenoon we were pretty well acquainted, andknowing that two long days were before us, we set ourselves to thetask of passing the time. The women cooked their meals on the rangein the forward part of the car, or attended to the toilets of thechildren, quite as regularly as in their own homes; while the men,having no duties to perform, played cards, or talked endlesslyconcerning their prospects in the Northwest, and when weary of this,joined in singing topical songs.No one knew his neighbor's name, and, for the most part, no onecared. All were in mountaineer dress, with rifles, revolvers, andboxes of cartridges, and the sight of a flock of antelopes developedin each man a frenzy of desire to have a shot at them. It was a wildride, and all day we climbed over low swells, passing little lakescovered with geese and brant, practically the only living things.Late in the afternoon we entered upon the Selkirks, where no lifewas.These mountains I had long wished to see, and they were in no sense adisappointment. Desolate, death-haunted, they pushed their whitedomes into the blue sky in savage grandeur. The little snow-coveredtowns seemed to cower at their feet like timid animals lost in theimmensity of the forest. All day we rode among these heights, and atnight we went to sleep feeling the chill of their desolate presence.We reached Ashcroft (which was the beginning of the long trail) atsunrise. The town lay low on the sand, a spatter of little framebuildings, mainly saloons and lodging houses, and resembled anordinary cow-town in the Western States.Rivers of dust were flowing in the streets as we debarked from thetrain. The land seemed dry as ashes, and the hills which rose nearresembled those of Montana or Colorado. The little hotel swarmed withthe rudest and crudest types of men; not dangerous men, onlythoughtless and profane teamsters and cow-boys, who drank thirstilyand ate like wolves. They spat on the floor while at the table,leaning on their elbows gracelessly. In the bar-room they drank andchewed tobacco, and talked in loud voices upon nothing at all.Down on the flats along the railway a dozen camps of Klondikers wereset exposed to the dust and burning sun. The sidewalks swarmed withoutfitters. Everywhere about us the talk of teamsters and cattle menwent on, concerning regions of which I had never heard. Men spoke ofHat Creek, the Chilcoten country, Soda Creek, Lake La Hache, andLilloat. Chinamen in long boots, much too large for them, came andwent sombrely, buying gold sacks and picks. They were mining quietlyon the upper waters of the Fraser, and were popularly supposed to begetting rich.The townspeople were possessed of thrift quite American in quality,and were making the most of the rush over the trail. "The grass isimproving each day," they said to the goldseekers, who were disposedto feel that the townsmen were anything but disinterested, especiallythe hotel keepers. Among the outfitters of course the chiefbeneficiaries were the horse dealers, and every corral swarmed withmangy little cayuses, thin, hairy, and wild-eyed; while on thefences, in silent meditation or low-voiced conferences, the intendingpurchasers sat in rows like dyspeptic ravens. The wind stormcontinued, filling the houses with dust and making life intolerablein the camps below the town. But the crowds moved to and frorestlessly on the one wooden sidewalk, outfitting busily. Thecostumes were as various as the fancies of the men, but laced bootsand cow-boy hats predominated.As I talked with some of the more thoughtful and conscientiouscitizens, I found them taking a very serious view of our trip intothe interior. "It is a mighty hard and long road," they said, "and alot of those fellows who have never tried a trail of this kind willfind it anything but a picnic excursion." They had known a few menwho had been as far as Hazleton, and the tales of rain, flies, andmosquitoes which these adventurers brought back with them, theyrepeated in confidential whispers.However, I had determined to go, and had prepared myself for everyemergency. I had designed an insect-proof tent, and was provided witha rubber mattress, a down sleeping-bag, rain-proof clothing, andstout shoes. I purchased, as did many of the others, two bills ofgoods from the Hudson Bay Company, to be delivered at Hazleton on theSkeena, and at Glenora on the Stikeen. Even with this arrangement itwas necessary to carry every crumb of food, in one case three hundredand sixty miles, and in the other case four hundred miles. However,the first two hundred and twenty miles would be in the nature of apractice march, for the trail ran through a country with occasionalranches where feed could be obtained. We planned to start with fourhorses, taking on others as we needed them. And for one week wescrutinized the ponies swarming around the corrals, in an attempt tofind two packhorses that would not give out on the trail, or bucktheir packs off at the start."We do not intend to be bothered with a lot of mean broncos," I said,and would not permit myself to be deceived. Before many days hadpassed, we had acquired the reputation of men who thoroughly knewwhat they wanted. At least, it became known that we would not buywild cayuses at an exorbitant price.All the week long we saw men starting out with sore-backed or blindor weak or mean broncos, and heard many stories of their troubles andtrials. The trail was said to be littered for fifty miles with allkinds of supplies.One evening, as I stood on the porch of the hotel, I saw a man ridinga spirited dapple-gray horse up the street. As I watched the splendidfling of his fore-feet, the proud carriage of his head, the splendidnostrils, the deep intelligent eyes, I said: "There is my horse! Iwonder if he is for sale."A bystander remarked, "He's coming to see you, and you can have thehorse if you want it."The rider drew rein, and I went out to meet him. After looking thehorse all over, with a subtle show of not being in haste, I asked,"How much will you take for him?""Fifty dollars," he replied, and I knew by the tone of his voice thathe would not take less.I hemmed and hawed a decent interval, examining every limb meanwhile;finally I said, "Get off your horse."With a certain sadness the man complied. I placed in his hand afifty-dollar bill, and took the horse by the bridle. "What is hisname?""I call him Prince.""He shall be called Prince Ladrone," I said to Burton, as I led thehorse away.Each moment increased my joy and pride in my dapple-gray gelding. Icould scarcely convince myself of my good fortune, and concludedthere must be something the matter with the horse. I was afraid ofsome trick, some meanness, for almost all mountain horses are"streaky," but I could discover nothing. He was quick on his feet asa cat, listened to every word that was spoken to him, and obeyed asinstantly and as cheerfully as a dog. He took up his feet at request,he stood over in the stall at a touch, and took the bit readily (asevere test). In every way he seemed to be exactly the horse I hadbeen waiting for. I became quite satisfied of his value the followingmorning, when his former owner said to me, in a voice of sadness,"Now treat him well, won't you?""He shall have the best there is," I replied.My partner, meanwhile, had rustled together three packhorses, whichwere guaranteed to be kind and gentle, and so at last we were readyto make a trial. It was a beautiful day for a start, sunny, silent,warm, with great floating clouds filling the sky.We had tried our tent, and it was pronounced a "jim-cracker-jack" byall who saw it, and exciting almost as much comment among the nativesas my Anderson pack-saddles. Our "truck" was ready on the platform ofthe storehouse, and the dealer in horses had agreed to pack theanimals in order to show that they were "as represented." The wholetown turned out to see the fun. The first horse began bucking beforethe pack-saddle was fairly on, to the vast amusement of thebystanders."That will do for that beast," I remarked, and he was led away."Bring up your other candidate."The next horse seemed to be gentle enough, but when one of the mentook off his bandanna and began binding it round the pony's head, Iinterrupted."That'll do," I said; "I know that trick. I don't want a horse whoseeyes have to be blinded. Take him away."This left us as we were before, with the exception of Ladrone. AnIndian standing near said to Burton, "I have gentle horse, no buck,all same like dog.""All right," said partner, with a sigh, "let's see him."The "dam Siwash" proved to be more reliable than his white detractor.His horses turned out to be gentle and strong, and we made a bargainwithout noise. At last it seemed we might be able to get away."To-morrow morning," said I to Burton, "if nothing furtherintervenes, we hit the trail a resounding whack."All around us similar preparations were going on. Half-breeds werebreaking wild ponies, cow-boys were packing, roping, and instructingthe tenderfoot, the stores swarmed with would-be miners fitting out,while other outfits already supplied were crawling up the distanthill like loosely articulated canvas-colored worms. Outfits fromSpokane and other southern towns began to drop down into the valley,and every train from the East brought other prospectors to standdazed and wondering before the squalid little camp. Each day, eachhour, increased the general eagerness to get away.FROM PLAIN TO PEAK    From hot low sands aflame with heat,      From crackling cedars dripping odorous gum,    I ride to set my burning feet      On heights whence Uncompagre's waters hum,    From rock to rock, and run                As white as wool.    My panting horse sniffs on the breeze      The water smell, too faint for me to know;    But I can see afar the trees,      Which tell of grasses where the asters blow,    And columbines and clover bending low                Are honey-full.    I catch the gleam of snow-fields, bright      As burnished shields of tempered steel,    And round each sovereign lonely height      I watch the storm-clouds vault and reel,    Heavy with hail and trailing                Veils of sleet.    "Hurrah, my faithful! soon you shall plunge      Your burning nostril to the bit in snow;    Soon you shall rest where foam-white waters lunge      From cliff to cliff, and you shall know    No more of hunger or the flame of sand                Or windless desert's heat!"CHAPTER IIION THE STAGE ROADOn the third day of May, after a whole forenoon of packing and"fussing," we made our start and passed successfully over somefourteen miles of the road. It was warm and beautiful, and we feltgreatly relieved to escape from the dry and dusty town with itsconscienceless horse jockeys and its bibulous teamsters.As we mounted the white-hot road which climbed sharply to thenortheast, we could scarcely restrain a shout of exultation. It wasperfect weather. We rode good horses, we had chosen our companions,and before us lay a thousand miles of trail, and the mysterious goldfields of the far-off Yukon. For two hundred and twenty miles theroad ran nearly north toward the town of Quesnelle, which was thetrading camp for the Caribou Mining Company. This highway was filledwith heavy teams, and stage houses were frequent. We might have goneby the river trail, but as the grass was yet young, many of theoutfits decided to keep to the stage road.We made our first camp beside the dusty road near the stage barn, inwhich we housed our horses. A beautiful stream came down from thehills near us. A little farther up the road a big and hairyCalifornian, with two half-breed assistants, was struggling withtwenty-five wild cayuses. Two or three campfires sparkled near.There was a vivid charm in the scene. The poplars were in tenderleaf. The moon, round and brilliant, was rising just above themountains to the east, as we made our bed and went to sleep with thesinging of the stream in our ears.While we were cooking our breakfast the next morning the bigCalifornian sauntered by, looking at our little folding stove, ourtent, our new-fangled pack-saddles, and our luxurious beds, andremarked:--"I reckon you fellers are just out on a kind of little hunting trip."We resented the tone of derision in his voice, and I replied:--"We are bound for Teslin Lake. We shall be glad to see you any timeduring the coming fall."He never caught up with us again.We climbed steadily all the next day with the wind roaring over ourheads in the pines. It grew much colder and the snow covered thenear-by hills. The road was full of trampers on their way to themines at Quesnelle and Stanley. I will not call them _tramps_, forevery man who goes afoot in this land is entitled to a certainmeasure of respect. We camped at night just outside the littlevillage called Clinton, which was not unlike a town in Vermont, andwas established during the Caribou rush in '66. It lay in a lovelyvalley beside a swift, clear stream. The sward was deliciously greenwhere we set our tent.Thus far Burton had wrestled rather unsuccessfully with thecrystallized eggs and evaporated potatoes which made up a part of ouroutfit. "I don't seem to get just the right twist on 'em," he said."You'll have plenty of chance to experiment," I remarked. However,the bacon was good and so was the graham bread which he turned outpiping hot from the little oven of our folding stove.Leaving Clinton we entered upon a lonely region, a waste of woodedridges breaking illimitably upon the sky. The air sharpened as werose, till it seemed like March instead of April, and our overcoatswere grateful.Somewhere near the middle of the forenoon, as we were jogging along,I saw a deer standing just at the edge of the road and looking acrossit, as if in fear of its blazing publicity. It seemed for a moment asif he were an optical illusion, so beautiful, so shapely, and sopalpitant was he. I had no desire to shoot him, but, turning toBurton, called in a low voice, "See that deer."He replied, "Where is your gun?"Now under my knee I carried a new rifle with a quantity of smokelesscartridges, steel-jacketed and soft-nosed, and yet I was disposed toargue the matter. "See here, Burton, it will be bloody business if wekill that deer. We couldn't eat all of it; you wouldn't want to skinit; I couldn't. You'd get your hands all bloody and the memory ofthat beautiful creature would not be pleasant. Therefore I stand forletting him go."Burton looked thoughtful. "Well, we might sell it or give it away."Meanwhile the deer saw us, but seemed not to be apprehensive. Perhapsit was a thought-reading deer, and knew that we meant it no harm. AsBurton spoke, it turned, silent as a shadow, and running to the crestof the hill stood for a moment outlined like a figure of bronzeagainst the sky, then disappeared into the forest. He was so much apart of nature that the horses gave no sign of having seen him atall.At a point a few miles beyond Clinton most of the pack trains turnedsharply to the left to the Fraser River, where the grass was reportedto be much better. We determined to continue on the stage road,however, and thereafter met but few outfits. The road was by no meansempty, however. We met, from time to time, great blue or red wagonsdrawn by four or six horses, moving with pleasant jangle of bells andthe crack of great whips. The drivers looked down at us curiously andsomewhat haughtily from their high seats, as if to say, "We knowwhere we are going--do you know as much?"The landscape grew ever wilder, and the foliage each day spring-like.We were on a high hilly plateau between Hat Creek and the valley ofLake La Hache. We passed lakes surrounded by ghostly dead trees,which looked as though the water had poisoned them. There were noranches of any extent on these hills. The trail continued to befilled with tramping miners; several seemed to be without bedding orfood. Some drove little pack animals laden with blankets, and allwalked like fiends, pressing forward doggedly, hour after hour. Manyof them were Italians, and one group which we overtook went alongkilling robins for food. They were a merry and dramatic lot, makingthe silent forests echo with their chatter.I headed my train on Ladrone, who led the way with a fine statelytread, his deep brown eyes alight with intelligence, his sensitiveears attentive to every word. He had impressed me already by hislearning and gentleness, but when one of my packhorses ran aroundhim, entangling me in the lead rope, pulling me to the ground, thefinal test of his quality came. I expected to be kicked into shreds.But Ladrone stopped instantly, and looking down at me inquiringly,waited for me to scramble out from beneath his feet and drag thesaddle up to its place.With heart filled with gratitude, I patted him on the nose, and said,"Old boy, if you carry me through to Teslin Lake, I will take care ofyou for the rest of your days."At about noon the next day we came down off the high plateau, withits cold and snow, and camped in a sunny sward near a splendid ranchwhere lambs were at play on the green grass. Blackbirds were calling,and we heard our first crane bugling high in the sky. From theloneliness and desolation of the high country, with its sparse roadhouses, we were now surrounded by sunny fields mellow with thirtyseasons' ploughing.The ride was very beautiful. Just the sort of thing we had beenhoping for. All day we skirted fine lakes with grassy shores. Cranes,ducks, and geese filled every pond, the voice of spring in theirbrazen throats.Once a large flight of crane went sweeping by high in the sky, aroyal, swift scythe reaping the clouds. I called to them in their owntongue, and they answered. I called again and again, and they beganto waver and talk among themselves; and at last, having decided thatthis voice from below should be heeded, they broke rank and commencedsweeping round and round in great circles, seeking the lost one whosecry rose from afar. Baffled and angered, they rearranged themselvesat last in long regular lines, and swept on into the north.We camped on this, the sixth day, beside a fine stream which camefrom a lake, and here we encountered our first mosquitoes. Big, blackfellows they were, with a lazy, droning sound quite different fromany I had ever heard. However, they froze up early and did not botherus very much.At the one hundred and fifty-nine mile house, which was a stagetavern, we began to hear other bogie stories of the trail. We wereassured that horses were often poisoned by eating a certain plant,and that the mud and streams were terrible. Flies were a never endingtorment. All these I regarded as the croakings of men who had neverhad courage to go over the trail, and who exaggerated the accountsthey had heard from others.We were jogging along now some fifteen or twenty miles a day,thoroughly enjoying the trip. The sky was radiant, the aspens wereputting forth transparent yellow leaves. On the grassy slopes somesplendid yellow flowers quite new to me waved in the warm but strongbreeze. On the ninth day we reached Soda Creek, which is situated onthe Fraser River, at a point where the muddy stream is deep sunk inthe wooded hills.The town was a single row of ramshackle buildings, not unlike a smallMissouri River town. The citizens, so far as visible, formed a queercollection of old men addicted to rum. They all came out to admireLadrone and to criticise my pack-saddle, and as they stood aboutspitting and giving wise instances, they reminded me of the Jurors inMark Twain's "Puddin Head Wilson."One old man tottered up to my side to inquire, "Cap, where yougoing?""To Teslin Lake," I replied."Good Lord, think of it," said he. "Do you ever expect to get there?It is a terrible trip, my son, a terrible trip."At this point a large number of the outfits crossed to the oppositeside of the river and took the trail which kept up the west bank ofthe river. We, however, kept the stage road which ran on the highground of the eastern bank, forming a most beautiful drive. The riverwas in full view all the time, with endless vista of blue hills aboveand the shimmering water with radiant foliage below.Aside from the stage road and some few ranches on the river bottom,we were now in the wilderness. On our right rolled a wide wild seaof hills and forests, breaking at last on the great gold range. Tothe west, a still wilder country reaching to the impassable eastrange. On this, our eighth day out, we had our second sight of biggame. In the night I was awakened by Burton, calling in excitedwhisper, "There's a bear outside."It was cold, I was sleepy, my bed was very comfortable, and I did notwish to be disturbed. I merely growled, "Let him alone."But Burton, putting his head out of the door of the tent, grew stillmore interested. "There is a bear out there eating those muttonbones. Where's the gun?"I was nearly sinking off to sleep once more and I muttered, "Don'tbother me; the gun is in the corner of the tent." Burton begansnapping the lever of the gun impatiently and whispering somethingabout not being able to put the cartridge in. He was accustomed tothe old-fashioned Winchester, but had not tried these."Put it right in the top," I wearily said, "put it right in the top.""I have," he replied; "but I can't get it _in_ or out!"Meanwhile I had become sufficiently awake to take a mild interest inthe matter. I rose and looked out. As I saw a long, black, leancreature muzzling at something on the ground, I began to get excitedmyself."I guess we better let him go, hadn't we?" said Burton."Well, yes, as the cartridge is stuck in the gun; and so long as helets us alone I think we had better let him alone, especially as hishide is worth nothing at this season of the year, and he is too thinto make steak."The situation was getting comic, but probably it is well that thecartridge failed to go in. Burton stuck his head out of the tent,gave a sharp yell, and the huge creature vanished in the dark of theforest. The whole adventure came about naturally. The smell of ourfrying meat had gone far up over the hills to our right and off intothe great wilderness, alluring this lean hungry beast out of his den.Doubtless if Burton had been able to fire a shot into his woollyhide, we should have had a rare "mix up" of bear, tent, men,mattresses, and blankets.Mosquitoes increased, and, strange to say, they seemed to like theshade. They were all of the big, black, lazy variety. We came uponflights of humming-birds. I was rather tired of the saddle, and ofthe slow jog, jog, jog. But at last there came an hour which made thetrouble worth while. When our camp was set, our fire lighted, oursupper eaten, and we could stretch out and watch the sun go down overthe hills beyond the river, then the day seemed well spent. At suchan hour we grew reminiscent of old days, and out of our talk anoccasional verse naturally rose.MOMENTOUS HOUR    A coyote wailing in the yellow dawn,    A mountain land that stretches on and on,    And ceases not till in the skies    Vast peaks of rosy snow arise,    Like walls of plainsman's paradise.    I cannot tell why this is so;    I cannot say, I do not know    Why wind and wolf and yellow sky,    And grassy mesa, square and high,    Possess such power to satisfy.    But so it is. Deep in the grass    I lie and hear the winds' feet pass;    And all forgot is maid and man,    And hope and set ambitious plan    Are lost as though they ne'er began.A WISH    All day and many days I rode,    My horse's head set toward the sea;    And as I rode a longing came to me    That I might keep the sunset road,    Riding my horse right on and on,    O'ertake the day still lagging at the west,    And so reach boyhood from the dawn,    And be with all the days at rest.    For then the odor of the growing wheat,    The flare of sumach on the hills,    The touch of grasses to my feet    Would cure my brain of all its ills,--    Would fill my heart so full of joy    That no stern lines could fret my face.    There would I be forever boy,    Lit by the sky's unfailing grace.CHAPTER IVIN CAMP AT QUESNELLEWe came into Quesnelle about three o'clock of the eleventh day out.From a high point which overlooked the two rivers, we could see greatridges rolling in waves of deep blue against the sky to thenorthwest. Over these our slender little trail ran. The wind was inthe south, roaring up the river, and green grass was springing on theslopes.Quesnelle we found to be a little town on a high, smooth slope abovethe Fraser. We overtook many prospectors like ourselves camped on theriver bank waiting to cross.Here also telegraph bulletins concerning the Spanish war, datedLondon, Hong Kong, and Madrid, hung on the walls of the post-office.They were very brief and left plenty of room for imagination anddiscussion.Here I took a pony and a dog-cart and jogged away toward thelong-famous Caribou Mining district next day, for the purpose ofinspecting a mine belonging to some friends of mine. The ride wasvery desolate and lonely, a steady climb all the way, throughfire-devastated forests, toward the great peaks. Snow lay in theroadside ditches. Butterflies were fluttering about, and in the highhills I saw many toads crawling over the snowbanks, a singular sightto me. They were silent, perhaps from cold.Strange to say, this ride called up in my mind visions of the hotsands, and the sun-lit buttes and valleys of Arizona and Montana, andI wrote several verses as I jogged along in the pony-cart.When I returned to camp two days later, I found Burton ready andeager to move. The town swarmed with goldseekers pausing here to restand fill their parflêches. On the opposite side of the river otherscould be seen in camp, or already moving out over the trail, whichleft the river and climbed at once into the high ridges dark withpines in the west.As I sat with my partner at night talking of the start the next day,I began to feel not a fear but a certain respect for that narrowlittle path which was not an arm's span in width, but which wasnearly eight hundred miles in length. "From this point, Burton, it isbusiness. Our practice march is finished."The stories of flies and mosquitoes gave me more trouble thananything else, but a surveyor who had had much experience in thisNorthwestern country recommended the use of oil of pennyroyal, mixedwith lard or vaseline. "It will keep the mosquitoes and most of theflies away," he said. "I know, for I have tried it. You can't wear anet, at least I never could. It is too warm, and then it is always inyour way. You are in no danger from beasts, but you will curse theday you set out on this trail on account of the insects. It is theworst mosquito country in the world."THE GIFT OF WATER        "Is water nigh?"        The plainsmen cry,    As they meet and pass in the desert grass.        With finger tip        Across the lip    I ask the sombre Navajo.    The brown man smiles and answers "Sho!"[1]    With fingers high, he signs the miles        To the desert spring,    And so we pass in the dry dead grass,        Brothers in bond of the water's ring.[Footnote 1: Listen. Your attention.]MOUNTING    I mount and mount toward the sky,    The eagle's heart is mine,    I ride to put the clouds a-by    Where silver lakelets shine.    The roaring streams wax white with snow,    The eagle's nest draws near,    The blue sky widens, hid peaks glow,    The air is frosty clear.    _And so from cliff to cliff I rise,_    _The eagle's heart is mine;_    _Above me ever broadning skies,_    _Below the rivers shine._THE EAGLE TRAIL    From rock-built nest,    The mother eagle, with a threatning tongue,    Utters a warning scream. Her shrill voice rings    Wild as the snow-topped crags she sits among;    While hovering with her quivering wings    Her hungry brood, with eyes ablaze    She watches every shadow. The water calls    Far, far below. The sun's red rays    Ascend the icy, iron walls,    And leap beyond the mountains in the west,    And over the trail and the eagle's nest    The clear night falls.CHAPTER VTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE BLUE RAT_Camp Twelve_Next morning as we took the boat--which was filled with horses wildand restless--I had a moment of exultation to think we had left theway of tin cans and whiskey bottles, and were now about to enter uponthe actual trail. The horses gave us a great deal of trouble on theboat, but we managed to get across safely without damage to any partof our outfit.Here began our acquaintance with the Blue Rat. It had become evidentto me during our stay in Quesnelle that we needed one more horse tomake sure of having provisions sufficient to carry us over the threehundred and sixty miles which lay between the Fraser and our nexteating-place on the Skeena. Horses, however, were very scarce, and itwas not until late in the day that we heard of a man who had a ponyto sell. The name of this man was Dippy.He was a German, and had a hare-lip and a most seductive gentlenessof voice. I gladly make him historical. He sold me the Blue Rat, andgave me a chance to study a new type of horse.Herr Dippy was not a Washington Irving sort of Dutchman; he conformedrather to the modern New York tradesman. He was small, candid, andsmooth, very smooth, of speech. He said: "Yes, the pony is gentle. Hecan be rode or packed, but you better lead him for a day or two tillhe gets quiet."I had not seen the pony, but my partner had crossed to the west sideof the Fraser River, and had reported him to be a "nice little pony,round and fat and gentle." On that I had rested. Mr. Dippy joined usat the ferry and waited around to finish the trade. I presumed heintended to cross and deliver the pony, which was in a corral on thewest side, but he lisped out a hurried excuse. "The ferry is notcoming back for to-day and so--"Well, I paid him the money on the strength of my side partner'sreport; besides, it was Hobson's choice.Mr. Dippy took the twenty-five dollars eagerly and vanished intoobscurity. We passed to the wild side of the Fraser and entered upona long and intimate study of the Blue Rat. He shucked out of the logstable a smooth, round, lithe-bodied little cayuse of a blue-graycolor. He looked like a child's toy, but seemed sturdy and of goodcondition. His foretop was "banged," and he had the air of amischievous, resolute boy. His eyes were big and black, and hestudied us with tranquil but inquiring gaze as we put the pack-saddleon him. He was very small."He's not large, but he's a gentle little chap," said I, to ease mypartner of his dismay over the pony's surprising smallness."I believe he shrunk during the night," replied my partner. "Heseemed two sizes bigger yesterday."We packed him with one hundred pounds of our food and lashed it allon with rope, while the pony dozed peacefully. Once or twice Ithought I saw his ears cross; one laid back, the other setforward,--bad signs,--but it was done so quickly I could not be sureof it.We packed the other horses while the blue pony stood resting one hindleg, his eyes dreaming.I flung the canvas cover over the bay packhorse.... Something tookplace. I heard a bang, a clatter, a rattling of hoofs. I peeredaround the bay and saw the blue pony performing some of the mostfinished, vigorous, and varied bucking it has ever been given me towitness. He all but threw somersaults. He stood on his upper lip. Hehumped up his back till he looked like a lean cat on a graveyardfence. He stood on his toe calks and spun like a weather-vane on alivery stable, and when the pack exploded and the saddle slippedunder his belly, he kicked it to pieces by using both hind hoofs asfeatly as a man would stroke his beard.After calming the other horses, I faced my partner solemnly."Oh, by the way, partner, where did you get that nice, quiet, littleblue pony of yours?"Partner smiled sheepishly. "The little divil. Buffalo Bill ought tohave that pony.""Well, now," said I, restraining my laughter, "the thing to do is toput that pack on so that it will stay. That pony will try the samething again, sure."We packed him again with great care. His big, innocent black eyesshining under his bang were a little more alert, but they showedneither fear nor rage. We roped him in every conceivable way, and atlast stood clear and dared him to do his prettiest.He did it. All that had gone before was merely preparatory, ablood-warming, so to say; the real thing now took place. He stood upon his hind legs and shot into the air, alighting on his four feet asif to pierce the earth. He whirled like a howling dervish, grunting,snorting--unseeing, and almost unseen in a nimbus of dust, strapends, and flying pine needles. His whirling undid him. We seized therope, and just as the pack again slid under his feet we set shoulderto the rope and threw him. He came to earth with a thud, his legswhirling uselessly in the air. He resembled a beetle in molasses. Wesat upon his head and discussed him."He is a wonder," said my partner.We packed him again with infinite pains, and when he began bucking wethrew him again and tried to kill him. We were getting irritated. Wethrew him hard, and drew his hind legs up to his head till hegrunted. When he was permitted to rise, he looked meek and small andtired and we were both deeply remorseful. We rearranged the pack--itwas some encouragement to know he had not bucked it entirely off--andby blindfolding him we got him started on the trail behind thetrain."I suppose that simple-hearted Dutchman is gloating over us fromacross the river," said I to partner; "but no matter, we arevictorious."I was now quite absorbed in a study of the blue pony's psychology. Hewas a new type of mean pony. His eye did not roll nor his ears fallback. He seemed neither scared nor angry. He still looked like aroguish, determined boy. He was alert, watchful, but not vicious. Hewent off--precisely like one of those mechanical mice or turtleswhich sidewalk venders operate. Once started, he could not stop tillhe ran down. He seemed not to take our stern measures in bad part. Heregarded it as a fair contract, apparently, and considered that wehad won. True, he had lost both hair and skin by getting tangled inthe rope, but he laid up nothing against us, and, as he followedmeekly along behind, partner dared to say:--"He's all right now. I presume he has been running out all winter andis a little wild. He's satisfied now. We'll have no more trouble withhim."Every time I looked back at the poor, humbled little chap, my hearttingled with pity and remorse. "We were too rough," I said. "We mustbe more gentle.""Yes, he's nervous and scary; we must be careful not to give him asudden start. I'll lead him for a while."An hour later, as we were going down a steep and slippery hill, theRat saw his chance. He passed into another spasm, opening andshutting like a self-acting jack-knife. He bounded into the midst ofthe peaceful horses, scattering them to right and to left in terror.He turned and came up the hill to get another start. Partner took aturn on a stump, and all unmindful of it the Rat whirled and made amighty spring. He reached the end of the rope and his hand-springbecame a vaulting somersault. He lay, unable to rise, spatting thewind, breathing heavily. Such annoying energy I have never seen. Wewere now mad, muddy, and very resolute. We held him down till he layquite still. Any well-considered, properly bred animal would havebeen ground to bone dust by such wondrous acrobatic movements. He wasskinned in one or two places, the hair was scraped from his nose, histongue bled, but all these were mere scratches. When we repacked himhe walked off comparatively unhurt.NOON ON THE PLAIN    The horned toad creeping along the sand,    The rattlesnake asleep beneath the sage,    Have now a subtle fatal charm.    In their sultry calm, their love of heat,    I read once more the burning page    Of nature under cloudless skies.    O pitiless and splendid land!    Mine eyelids close, my lips are dry    By force of thy hot floods of light.    Soundless as oil the wind flows by,    Mine aching brain cries out for night!CHAPTER VITHE BEGINNING OF THE LONG TRAILAs we left the bank of the Fraser River we put all wheel tracksbehind. The trail turned to the west and began to climb, following anold swath which had been cut into the black pines by an adventuroustelegraph company in 1865. Immense sums of money were put into thisventure by men who believed the ocean cable could not be laid. Thework was stopped midway by the success of Field's wonderful plan, andall along the roadway the rusted and twisted wire lay in testimony ofthe seriousness of the original design.The trail was a white man's road. It lacked grace and charm. It cutuselessly over hills and plunged senselessly into ravines. It was anirritation to all of us who knew the easy swing, the circumspection,and the labor-saving devices of an Indian trail. The telegraph linewas laid by compass, not by the stars and the peaks; it evadednothing; it saved distance, not labor.My feeling of respect deepened into awe as we began to climb thegreat wooded divide which lies between the Fraser and the Blackwater.The wild forest settled around us, grim, stern, and forbidding. Wewere done with civilization. Everything that was required for a homein the cold and in the heat was bound upon our five horses. We mustcarry bed, board, roof, food, and medical stores, over three hundredand sixty miles of trail, through all that might intervene of floodand forest.This feeling of awe was emphasized by the coming on of the storm inwhich we camped that night. We were forced to keep going until latein order to obtain feed, and to hustle in order to get everythingunder cover before the rain began to fall. We were only twelve mileson our way, but being wet and cold and hungry, we enjoyed the fullsense of being in the wilderness. However, the robins sang from thedamp woods and the loons laughed from hidden lakes.It rained all night, and in the morning we were forced to get out ina cold, wet dawn. It was a grim start, dismal and portentous,bringing the realities of the trail very close to us. While I rustledthe horses out of the wet bush, partner stirred up a capitalbreakfast of bacon, evaporated potatoes, crystallized eggs, andgraham bread. He had discovered at last the exact amount of water touse in cooking these "vegetables," and they were very good. Thepotatoes tasted not unlike mashed potatoes, and together with theeggs made a very savory and wholesome dish. With a cup of strongcoffee and some hot graham gems we got off in very good spiritsindeed.It continued muddy, wet, and cold. I walked most of the day, leadingmy horse, upon whom I had packed a part of the outfit to relieve theother horses. There was no fun in the day, only worry and trouble. Myfeet were wet, my joints stiff, and my brain weary of the monotonousblack, pine forest.There is a great deal of work on the trail,--cooking, care of thehorses, together with almost ceaseless packing and unpacking, and thebother of keeping the packhorses out of the mud. We were busy fromfive o'clock in the morning until nine at night. There were otheroutfits on the trail having a full ton of supplies, and this greatweight had to be handled four times a day. In our case the toil wasmuch less, but it was only by snatching time from my partner that Iwas able to work on my notes and keep my diary. Had the land beenless empty of game and richer in color, I should not have minded thetoil and care taking. As it was, we were all looking forward to thebeautiful lake country which we were told lay just beyond theBlackwater.One tremendous fact soon impressed me. There were no returningfootsteps on this trail. All toes pointed in one way, toward thegolden North. No man knew more than his neighbor the character of theland which lay before us.The life of each outfit was practically the same. At about 4.30 inthe morning the campers awoke. The click-clack of axes began, andslender columns of pale blue smoke stole softly into the air. Thenfollowed the noisy rustling of the horses by those set aside for thatduty. By the time the horses were "cussed into camp," the coffee washot, and the bacon and beans ready to be eaten. A race in packingtook place to see who should pull out first. At about seven o'clockin the morning the outfits began to move. But here there was adifference of method. Most of them travelled for six or seven hourswithout unpacking, whereas our plan was to travel for four hours,rest from twelve to three, and pack up and travel four hours more.This difference in method resulted in our passing outfit after outfitwho were unable to make the same distances by their one march.We went to bed with the robins and found it no hardship to rise withthe sparrows. As Burton got the fire going, I dressed and went out tosee if all the horses were in the bunch, and edged them along towardthe camp. I then packed up the goods, struck the tent and folded it,and had everything ready to sling on the horses by the time breakfastwas ready.With my rifle under my knee, my rain coat rolled behind my saddle, mycamera dangling handily, my rope coiled and lashed, I called out,"Are we all set?""Oh, I guess so," Burton invariably replied.With a last look at the camping ground to see that nothing of valuewas left, we called in exactly the same way each time, "Hike, boys,hike, hike." (Hy-ak: Chinook for "hurry up.") It was a fine thing,and it never failed to touch me, to see them fall in, one by one. The"Ewe-neck" just behind Ladrone, after him "Old Bill," and behind him,groaning and taking on as if in great pain, "Major Grunt," while atthe rear, with sharp outcry, came Burton riding the blue pony, whowas quite content, as we soon learned, to carry a man weighingseventy pounds more than his pack. He considered himself a saddlehorse, not a pack animal.It was not an easy thing to keep a pack train like this running. Asthe horses became tired of the saddle, two of them were disposed torun off into the brush in an attempt to scrape their load from theirbacks. Others fell to feeding. Sometimes Bill would attempt to passthe bay in order to walk next Ladrone. Then they would _scrouge_against each other like a couple of country schoolboys, to see whoshould get ahead. It was necessary to watch the packs with worrysomecare to see that nothing came loose, to keep the cinches tight, andto be sure that none of the horses were being galled by theirburdens.We travelled for the most part alone and generally in completesilence, for I was too far in advance to have any conversation withmy partner.The trail continued wet, muddy, and full of slippery inclines, but wecamped on a beautiful spot on the edge of a marshy lake two or threemiles in length. As we threw up our tent and started our fire, Iheard two cranes bugling magnificently from across the marsh, andwith my field-glass I could see them striding along in the edge ofthe water. The sun was getting well toward the west. All around stoodthe dark and mysterious forest, out of which strange noises broke.In answer to the bugling of the cranes, loons were wildly calling, aflock of geese, hidden somewhere under the level blaze of theorange-colored light of the setting sun, were holding clamorousconvention. This is one of the compensating moments of the trail. Tocome out of a gloomy and forbidding wood into an open and grassybank, to see the sun setting across the marsh behind the mostsplendid blue mountains, makes up for many weary hours of toil.As I lay down to sleep I heard a coyote cry, and the loons answered,and out of the cold, clear night the splendid voices of the cranesrang triumphantly. The heavens were made as brass by their superb,defiant notes.THE WHOOPING CRANE    At sunset from the shadowed sedge      Of lonely lake, among the reeds,    He lifts his brazen-throated call,      And the listening cat with teeth at edge    With famine hears and heeds.    "_Come one, come all, come all, come all!_"    Is the bird's challenge bravely blown    To every beast the woodlands own.    "_My legs are long, my wings are strong,_      _I wait the answer to my threat._"    Echoing, fearless, triumphant, the cry      Disperses through the world, and yet    Only the clamorous, cloudless sky      And the wooded mountains make reply.THE LOON          At some far time          This water sprite    A brother of the coyote must have been.          For when the sun is set,          Forth from the failing light          His harsh cries fret          The silence of the night,    And the hid wolf answers with a wailing keen.CHAPTER VIITHE BLACKWATER DIVIDEAbout noon the next day we suddenly descended to the Blackwater, aswift stream which had been newly bridged by those ahead of us. Inthis wild land streams were our only objective points; the mountainshad no names, and the monotony of the forest produced a singulareffect on our minds. Our journey at times seemed a sort of motionlessprogression. Once our tent was set and our baggage arranged about us,we lost all sense of having moved at all.Immediately after leaving the Blackwater bridge we had a gratefultouch of an Indian trail. The telegraph route kept to the valleyflat, but an old trail turned to the right and climbed the north bankby an easy and graceful grade which it was a joy to follow. The topof the bench was wooded and grassy, and the smooth brown trail woundaway sinuous as a serpent under the splendid pine trees. For morethan three hours we strolled along this bank as distinguished asthose who occupy boxes at the theatre. Below us the Blackwater loopedaway under a sunny sky, and far beyond, enormous and unnamed, deepblue mountains rose, notching the western sky. The scene was soexceedingly rich and amiable we could hardly believe it to bewithout farms and villages, yet only an Indian hut or two gaveindication of human life.After following this bank for a few miles, we turned to the right andbegan to climb the high divide which lies between the Blackwater andthe Muddy, both of which are upper waters of the Fraser. Like all thehigh country through which we had passed this ridge was covered witha monotonous forest of small black pines, with very little bird oranimal life of any kind. By contrast the valley of the Blackwatershone in our memory like a jewel.After a hard drive we camped beside a small creek, together withseveral other outfits. One of them belonged to a doctor from theChilcoten country. He was one of those Englishmen who are naturalplainsmen. He was always calm, cheerful, and self-contained. He tookall worry and danger as a matter of course, and did not attempt tocarry the customs of a London hotel into the camp. When an Englishmanhas this temper, he makes one of the best campaigners in the world.As I came to meet the other men on the trail, I found that somepeculiar circumstance had led to their choice of route. The doctorhad a ranch in the valley of the Fraser. One of "the Manchester boys"had a cousin near Soda Creek. "Siwash Charley" wished to prospect onthe head-waters of the Skeena; and so in almost every case somespecial excuse was given. When the truth was known, the love ofadventure had led all of us to take the telegraph route. Most of theminers argued that they could make their entrance by horse ascheaply, if not as quickly, as by boat. For the most part they wereyoung, hardy, and temperate young men of the middle condition ofAmerican life.One of the Manchester men had been a farmer in Connecticut, anattendant in an insane asylum in Massachusetts, and an engineer. Hewas fat when he started, and weighed two hundred and twenty pounds.By the time we had overtaken him his trousers had begun to flaparound him. He was known as "Big Bill." His companion, Frank, was asinewy little fellow with no extra flesh at all,--an alert, cheery,and vociferous boy, who made noise enough to scare all the game outof the valley. Neither of these men had ever saddled a horse beforereaching the Chilcoten, but they developed at once into skilfulpackers and rugged trailers, though they still exposed themselvesunnecessarily in order to show that they were not "tenderfeet.""Siwash Charley" was a Montana miner who spoke Chinook fluently, andswore in splendid rhythms on occasion. He was small, alert, seasonedto the trail, and capable of any hardship. "The Man from Chihuahua"was so called because he had been prospecting in Mexico. He had thebest packhorses on the trail, and cared for them like a mother. Hewas small, weazened, hardy as oak, inured to every hardship, and verywise in all things. He had led his fine little train of horses fromChihuahua to Seattle, thence to the Thompson River, joining us atQuesnelle. He was the typical trailer. He spoke in the Missourifashion, though he was a born Californian. His partner was a quietlittle man from Snohomish flats, in Washington. These outfits weretypical of scores of others, and it will be seen that they were forthe most part Americans, the group of Germans from New York City andthe English doctor being the exceptions.There was little talk among us. We were not merely going a journey,but going as rapidly as was prudent, and there was close attention tobusiness. There was something morbidly persistent in the action ofthese trains. They pushed on resolutely, grimly, like blind wormsfollowing some directing force from within. This peculiarity ofaction became more noticeable day by day. We were not on the trail,after all, to hunt, or fish, or skylark. We had set our eyes on adistant place, and toward it our feet moved, even in sleep.The Muddy River, which we reached late in the afternoon, was silentas oil and very deep, while the banks, muddy and abrupt, made it ahard stream to cross.As we stood considering the problem, a couple of Indians appeared onthe opposite bank with a small raft, and we struck a bargain withthem to ferry our outfit. They set us across in short order, but ourhorses were forced to swim. They were very much alarmed and shiveredwith excitement (this being the first stream that called forswimming), but they crossed in fine style, Ladrone leading, his neckcurving, his nostrils wide-blown. We were forced to camp in the mudof the river bank, and the gray clouds flying overhead made the landexceedingly dismal. The night closed in wet and cheerless.The two Indians stopped to supper with us and ate heartily. I seizedthe opportunity to talk with them, and secured from them the tragicstory of the death of the Blackwater Indians. "Siwash, he die hy-u(great many). Hy-u die, chilens, klootchmans (women), all die. Whiteman no help. No send doctor. Siwash all die, white man no care bellymuch."In this simple account of the wiping out of a village of harmlesspeople by "the white man's disease" (small-pox), unaided by the whiteman's wonderful skill, there lies one of the great tragedies ofsavage life. Very few were left on the Blackwater or on the Muddy,though a considerable village had once made the valley cheerful withits primitive pursuits.They were profoundly impressed by our tent and gun, and sat on theirhaunches clicking their tongues again and again in admiration, sayingof the tent, "All the same lilly (little) house." I tried to tellthem of the great world to the south, and asked them a great manyquestions to discover how much they knew of the people or themountains. They knew nothing of the plains Indians, but one of themhad heard of Vancouver and Seattle. They had not the dignity andthinking power of the plains people, but they seemed amiable andrather jovial.We passed next day two adventurers tramping their way to Hazleton.Each man carried a roll of cheap quilts, a skillet, and a cup. Wecame upon them as they were taking off their shoes and stockings towade through a swift little river, and I realized with a sudden pangof sympathetic pain, how distressing these streams must be to such asgo afoot, whereas I, on my fine horse, had considered them entirelyfrom an æsthetic point of view.We had been on the road from Quesnelle a week, and had made nearlyone hundred miles, jogging along some fifteen miles each day,camping, eating, sleeping, with nothing to excite us--indeed, thetrail was quiet as a country lane. A dead horse here and there warnedus to be careful how we pushed our own burden-bearers. We were deepin the forest, with the pale blue sky filled with clouds showing onlyin patches overhead. We passed successively from one swamp of blackpine to another, over ridges covered with white pine, all preciselyalike. As soon as our camp was set and fires lighted, we lost allsense of having travelled, so similar were the surroundings of eachcamp.Partridges could be heard drumming in the lowlands. Mosquitoes weredeveloping by the millions, and cooking had become almost impossiblewithout protection. The "varments" came in relays. A small grayvariety took hold of us while it was warm, and when it became toocold for them, the big, black, "sticky" fellows appearedmysteriously, and hung around in the air uttering deep, bass noteslike lazy flies. The little gray fellows were singularly ferociousand insistent in their attentions.At last, as we were winding down the trail beneath the pines, we camesuddenly upon an Indian with a gun in the hollow of his arm. Sostill, so shadowy, so neutral in color was he, that at first sight heseemed a part of the forest, like the shaded hole of a tree. Heturned out to be a "runner," so to speak, for the ferrymen atTchincut Crossing, and led us down to the outlet of the lake where agroup of natives with their slim canoes sat waiting to set us over.An hour's brisk work and we rose to the fine grassy eastern slopeoverlooking the lake.We rose on our stirrups with shouts of joy. We had reached the landof our dreams! Here was the trailers' heaven! Wooded promontories,around which the wavelets sparkled, pushed out into the deep, clearflood. Great mountains rose in the background, lonely, untouched byman's all-desolating hand, while all about us lay suave slopesclothed with most beautiful pea-vine, just beginning to ripple in thewind, and beyond lay level meadows lit by little ponds filled withwildfowl. There was just forest enough to lend mystery to thesemeadows, and to shut from our eager gaze the beauties of other andstill more entrancing glades. The most exacting hunter or trailercould not desire more perfect conditions for camping. It was God'sown country after the gloomy monotony of the barren pine forest, andneeded only a passing deer or a band of elk to be a poem as well as apicture.All day we skirted this glorious lake, and at night we camped on itsshores. The horses were as happy as their masters, feeding in plentyon sweet herbage for the first time in long days.Late in the day we passed the largest Indian village we had yet seen.It was situated on Stony Creek, which came from Tatchick Lake andemptied into Tchincut Lake. The shallows flickered with the passingof trout, and the natives were busy catching and drying them. As werode amid the curing sheds, the children raised a loud clamor, andthe women laughed and called from house to house, "Oh, see the whitemen!" We were a circus parade to them.Their opportunities for earning money are scant, and they live upon avery monotonous diet of fish and possibly dried venison and berries.Except at favorable points like Stony Creek, where a small streamleads from one lake to another, there are no villages because thereare no fish.I shall not soon forget the shining vistas through which we rode thatday, nor the meadows which possessed all the allurement and mysterywhich the word "savanna" has always had with me. It was like goingback to the prairies of Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa, as they weresixty years ago, except in this case the elk and the deer wereabsent.YET STILL WE RODE    We wallowed deep in mud and sand;      We swam swift streams that roared in wrath;    They stood at guard in that lone land,      Like dragons in the slender path.    Yet still we rode right on and on,      And shook our clenched hands at the sky.    We dared the frost at early dawn,      And the dread tempest sweeping by.    It was not all so dark. Now and again      The robin, singing loud and long,    Made wildness tame, and lit the rain      With sudden sunshine with his song.    Wild roses filled the air with grace,      The shooting-star swung like a bell    From bended stem, and all the place      Was like to heaven after hell.CHAPTER VIIIWE SWIM THE NECHACOHere was perfection of camping, but no allurement could turn thegoldseekers aside. Some of them remained for a day, a few for twodays, but not one forgot for a moment that he was on his way to theKlondike River sixteen hundred miles away. In my enthusiasm Iproposed to camp for a week, but my partner, who was "out for goldinstid o' daisies, 'guessed' we'd better be moving." He could notbear to see any one pass us, and that was the feeling of every man onthe trail. Each seemed to fear that the gold might all be claimedbefore he arrived. With a sigh I turned my back on this gloriousregion and took up the forward march.All the next day we skirted the shores of Tatchick Lake, coming latein the afternoon to the Nechaco River, a deep, rapid stream whichrose far to our left in the snowy peaks of the coast range. All daythe sky to the east had a brazen glow, as if a great fire were ragingthere, but toward night the wind changed and swept it away. The trailwas dusty for the first time, and the flies venomous. Late in theafternoon we pitched camp, setting our tent securely, expecting rain.Before we went to sleep the drops began to drum on the tent roof, apleasant sound after the burning dust of the trail. The two tramperskept abreast of us nearly all day, but they began to show fatigue andhunger, and a look of almost sullen desperation had settled on theirfaces.As we came down next day to where the swift Nechaco met the Endakorushing out of Fraser Lake, we found the most dangerous flood we hadyet crossed. A couple of white men were calking a large ferry-boat,but as it was not yet seaworthy and as they had no cable, the horsesmust swim. I dreaded to see them enter this chill, gray stream, fornot only was it wide and swift, but the two currents coming togethermade the landing confusing to the horses as well as to ourselves.Rain was at hand and we had no time to waste.The horses knew that some hard swimming was expected of them andwould gladly have turned back if they could. We surrounded them withfurious outcry and at last Ladrone sprang in and struck for thenearest point opposite, with that intelligence which marks the broncohorse. The others followed readily. Two of the poorer ones laboredheavily, but all touched shore in good order.The rain began to fall sharply and we were forced to camp on theopposite bank as swiftly as possible, in order to get out of thestorm. We worked hard and long to put everything under cover and weremuddy and tired at the end of it. At last the tent was up, the outfitcovered with waterproof canvas, the fire blazing and our breadbaking. In pitching our camp we had plenty of assistance at thehands of several Indian boys from a near-by village, who hung about,eager to lend a hand, in the hope of getting a cup of coffee and apiece of bread in payment. The streaming rain seemed to have no moreeffect upon them than on a loon. The conditions were all strangelysimilar to those at the Muddy River.Night closed in swiftly. Through the dark we could hear the low swishof the rising river, and Burton, with a sly twinkle in his eye,remarked, "For a semi-arid country, this is a pretty wet rain."In planning the trip, I had written to him saying: "The trail runsfor the most part though a semi-arid country, somewhat like easternWashington."It rained all the next day and we were forced to remain in camp,which was dismal business; but we made the best of it, doing somemending of clothes and tackle during the long hours.We were visited by all the Indians from Old Fort Fraser, which wasonly a mile away. They sat about our blazing fire laughing andchattering like a group of girls, discussing our characters minutely,and trying to get at our reasons for going on such a journey.One of them who spoke a little English said, after looking over mytraps: "You boss, you ty-ee, you belly rich man. Why you come?"This being interpreted meant, "You have a great many splendid things,you are rich. Now, why do you come away out here in this poor Siwashcountry?"I tried to convey to him that I wished to see the mountains and toget acquainted with the people. He then asked, "More white men come?"Throwing my hands in the air and spreading my fingers many times, Iexclaimed, "Hy-u white man, hy-u!" Whereat they all clicked theirtongues and looked at each other in astonishment. They could notunderstand why this sudden flood of white people should pour intotheir country. This I also explained in lame Chinook: "We go klapPilchickamin (gold). White man hears say Hy-u Pilchickamin there (Ipointed to the north). White man heap like Pilchickamin, so hecomes."All the afternoon and early evening little boys came and went on theswift river in their canoes, singing wild, hauntingly musical boatingsongs. They had no horses, but assembled in their canoes, racing andbetting precisely as the Cheyenne lads run horses at sunset in thevalley of the Lamedeer. All about the village the grass was rich andsweet, uncropped by any animal, for these poor fishermen do notaspire to the wonderful wealth of owning a horse. They had heard thatcattle were coming over the trail and all inquired, "Spose whenMoos-Moos come?" They knew that milk and butter were good things, andsome of them had hopes of owning a cow sometime.They had tiny little gardens in sheltered places on the sunny slopes,wherein a few potatoes were planted; for the rest they hunt and fishand trap in winter and trade skins for meat and flour and coffee, andso live. How they endure the winters in such wretched houses, it isimpossible to say. There was a lone white man living on the site ofthe old fort, as agent of the Hudson Bay Company. He kept a smallstock of clothing and groceries and traded for "skins," as theIndians all call pelts. They count in skins. So many skins will buy arifle, so many more will secure a sack of flour.The storekeeper told me that the two trampers had arrived there a fewdays before without money and without food. "I gave 'em some flourand sent 'em on," he said. "The Siwashes will take care of them, butit ain't right. What the cussed idiots mean by setting out on such ajourney I can't understand. Why, one tramp came in here early in thespring who couldn't speak English, and who left Quesnelle withouteven a blanket or an axe. Fact! And yet the Lord seems to take careof these fools. You wouldn't believe it, but that fellow picked up anaxe and a blanket the first day out. But he'd a died only for theIndians. They won't let even a white man starve to death. I helpedhim out with some flour and he went on. They all rush on. Seems likethey was just crazy to get to Dawson--couldn't sleep without dreamin'of it."I was almost as eager to get on as the tramps, but Burton went abouthis work regularly as a clock. I wrote, yawned, stirred the bigcampfire, gazed at the clouds, talked with the Indians, and so passedthe day. I began to be disturbed, for I knew the power of a rain onthe trail. It transforms it, makes it ferocious. The path that hascharmed and wooed, becomes uncertain, treacherous, gloomy, andengulfing. Creeks become rivers, rivers impassable torrents, andmarshes bottomless abysses. Pits of quicksand develop in mostunexpected places. Driven from smooth lake margins, the trailers'ponies are forced to climb ledges of rock, and to rattle over longslides of shale. In places the threadlike way itself becomes anaqueduct for a rushing overflow of water.At such times the man on the trail feels the grim power of Nature.She has no pity, no consideration. She sets mud, torrents, rocks,cold, mist, to check and chill him, to devour him. Over him he has noroof, under him no pavement. Never for an instant is he free from thepressure of the elements. Sullen streams lie athwart his road likedragons, and in a land like this, where snowy peaks rise on allsides, rain meant sudden and enormous floods of icy water.It was still drizzling on the third day, but we packed and pushed on,though the hills were slippery and the creeks swollen. Water waseverywhere, but the sun came out, lighting the woods into radiantgreens and purples. Robins and sparrows sang ecstatically, andviolets, dandelions, and various kinds of berries were in odorousbloom. A vine with a blue flower, new to me, attracted my attention,also a yellow blossom of the cowslip variety. This latter had a formnot unlike a wild sunflower.Here for the first time I heard a bird singing a song quite new tome. He was a thrushlike little fellow, very shy and difficult to seeas he sat poised on the tip of a black pine in the deep forest. Hisnote was a clear cling-ling, like the ringing of a steel triangle._Chingaling, chingaling_, one called near at hand, and then fartheroff another answered, _ching, ching, chingaling-aling_, with immensevim, power, and vociferation.Burton, who had spent many years in the mighty forests of Washington,said: "That little chap is familiar to me. Away in the pines wherethere is no other bird I used to hear his voice. No matter how darkit was, I could always tell when morning was coming by his note, andon cloudy days I could always tell when the sunset was coming byhearing him call."To me his phrase was not unlike the metallic ringing cry of a sort ofblackbird which I heard in the torrid plazas of Mexico. He was verydifficult to distinguish, for the reason that he sat so high in thetree and was so wary. He was very shy of approach. He was a plump,trim little fellow of a plain brown color, not unlike a small robin.There was another cheerful little bird, new to me also, which utteredan amusing phrase in two keys, something like _tee tay, tee tay, teetay_, one note sustained high and long, followed by another given ona lower key. It was not unlike to the sound made by a boy with atuning pipe. This, Burton said, was also a familiar sound in thedepths of the great Washington firs. These two cheery birds kept uscompany in the gloomy, black-pine forest, when we sorely neededsolace of some kind.Fraser Lake was also very charming, romantic enough to be the sceneof Cooper's best novels. The water was deliciously clear and cool,and from the farther shore great mountains rose in successive sweepsof dark green foothills. At this time we felt well satisfied withourselves and the trip. With a gleam in his eyes Burton said, "Thisis the kind of thing our folks think we're doing all the time."RELENTLESS NATURE    She laid her rivers to snare us,    She set her snows to chill,    Her clouds had the cunning of vultures,    Her plants were charged to kill.    The glooms of her forests benumbed us,    On the slime of her ledges we sprawled;    But we set our feet to the northward,    And crawled and crawled and crawled!    We defied her, and cursed her, and shouted:    "To hell with your rain and your snow.    Our minds we have set on a journey,    And despite of your anger we go!"CHAPTER IXTHE FIRST CROSSING OF THE BULKLEYWe were now following a chain of lakes to the source of the Endako,one of the chief northwest sources of the Fraser, and were surroundedby tumultuous ridges covered with a seamless robe of pine forests.For hundreds of miles on either hand lay an absolutely untrackedwilderness. In a land like this the trail always follows awater-course, either ascending or descending it; so for some days wefollowed the edges of these lakes and the banks of the connectingstreams, toiling over sharp hills and plunging into steep ravines,over a trail belly-deep in mud and water and through a wood empty oflife.These were hard days. We travelled for many hours through a burnt-outtract filled with twisted, blackened uprooted trees in the wake offire and hurricane. From this tangled desolation I received thesuggestion of some verses which I call "The Song of the North Wind."The wind and the fire worked together. If the wind precedes, heprepares the way for his brother fire, and in return the fire weakensthe trees to the wind.We had settled into a dull routine, and the worst feature of eachday's work was the drag, drag of slow hours on the trail. We couldnot hurry, and we were forced to watch our horses with unremittingcare in order to nurse them over the hard spots, or, rather, the softspots, in the trail. We were climbing rapidly and expected soon topass from the watershed of the Fraser into that of the Skeena.We passed a horse cold in death, with his head flung up as if he hadbeen fighting the wolves in his final death agony. It was a grimsight. Another beast stood abandoned beside the trail, gazing at usreproachfully, infinite pathos in his eyes. He seemed not to have theenergy to turn his head, but stood as if propped upon his legs, hisribs showing with horrible plainness a tragic dejection in everymuscle and limb.The feed was fairly good, our horses were feeling well, and curiouslyenough the mosquitoes had quite left us. We overtook and passed anumber of outfits camped beside a splendid rushing stream.On Burns' Lake we came suddenly upon a settlement of quite sizableIndian houses with beautiful pasturage about. The village containedtwenty-five or thirty families of carrier Indians, and was musicalwith the plaintive boat-songs of the young people. How long thesenative races have lived here no one can tell, but their mark on theland is almost imperceptible. They are not of those who mar thelandscape.On the first of June we topped the divide between the two mightywatersheds. Behind us lay the Fraser, before us the Skeena. Themajestic coast range rose like a wall of snow far away to thenorthwest, while a near-by lake, filling the foreground, reflectedthe blue ridges of the middle distance--a magnificent spread of wildlandscape. It made me wish to abandon the trail and push out into theunexplored.From this point we began to descend toward the Bulkley, which is themost easterly fork of the Skeena. Soon after starting on our downwardpath we came to a fork in the trail. One trail, newly blazed, led tothe right and seemed to be the one to take. We started upon it, butfound it dangerously muddy, and so returned to the main trail whichseemed to be more numerously travelled. Afterward we wished we hadtaken the other, for we got one of our horses into the quicksand andworked for more than three hours in the attempt to get him out. Ahorse is a strange animal. He is counted intelligent, and so he is ifhe happens to be a bronco or a mule. But in proportion as he is athoroughbred, he seems to lose power to take care of himself--losesheart. Our Ewe-neck bay had a trace of racer in him, and beingweakened by poor food, it was his bad luck to slip over the bank intoa quicksand creek. Having found himself helpless he instantly gave upheart and lay out with a piteous expression of resignation in his bigbrown eyes. We tugged and lifted and rolled him around from oneposition to another, each more dangerous than the first, all to noresult.While I held him up from drowning, my partner "brushed in" around himso that he _could_ not become submerged. We tried hitching the otherhorses to him in order to drag him out, but as they weresaddle-horses, and had never set shoulder to a collar in theirlives, they refused to pull even enough to take the proverbialsetting hen off the nest.Up to this time I had felt no need of company on the trail, and forthe most part we had travelled alone. But I now developed a poignantdesire to hear the tinkle of a bell on the back trail, for there isno "funny business" about losing a packhorse in the midst of a wildcountry. His value is not represented by the twenty-five dollarswhich you originally paid for him. Sometimes his life is worth allyou can give for him.After some three hours of toil (the horse getting weaker all thetime), I looked around once more with despairing gaze, and caughtsight of a bunch of horses across the valley flat. In this countrythere were no horses except such as the goldseeker owned, and thisbunch of horses meant a camp of trailers. Leaping to my saddle, Igalloped across the spongy marsh to hailing distance.My cries for help brought two of the men running with spades to helpus. The four of us together lifted the old horse out of the pit moredead than alive. We fell to and rubbed his legs to restorecirculation. Later we blanketed him and turned him loose upon thegrass. In a short time he was nearly as well as ever.It was a sorrowful experience, for a fallen horse is a horse in ruinsand makes a most woful appeal upon one's sympathies. I went to bedtired out, stiff and sore from pulling on the rope, my handsblistered, my nerves shaken.As I was sinking off to sleep I heard a wolf howl, as though hemourned the loss of a feast.We had been warned that the Bulkley River was a bad stream tocross,--in fact, the road-gang had cut a new trail in order to avoidit,--that is to say, they kept to the right around the sharp elbowwhich the river makes at this point, whereas the old trail cutdirectly across the elbow, making two crossings. At the point wherethe new trail led to the right we held a council of war to determinewhether to keep to the old trail, and so save several days' travel,or to turn to the right and avoid the difficult crossing. The newtrail was reported to be exceedingly miry, and that determined thematter--we concluded to make the short cut.We descended to the Bulkley through clouds of mosquitoes and endlesssloughs of mud. The river was out of its banks, and its quicksandflats were exceedingly dangerous to our pack animals, although theriver itself at this point was a small and sluggish stream.It took us exactly five hours of most exhausting toil to cross theriver and its flat. We worked like beavers, we sweated like hiredmen, wading up to our knees in water, and covered with mud, brushingin a road over the quicksand for the horses to walk. The Ewe-neckedbay was fairly crazy with fear of the mud, and it was necessary tolead him over every foot of the way. We went into camp for the firsttime too late to eat by daylight. It became necessary for us to use acandle inside the tent at about eleven o'clock.The horses were exhausted, and crazy for feed. It was a struggle toget them unpacked, so eager were they to forage. Ladrone, alwaysfaithful, touched my heart by his patience and gentleness, and hisreliance upon me. I again heard a gray wolf howl as I was sinking offto sleep.THE GAUNT GRAY WOLF    O a shadowy beast is the gaunt gray wolf!    And his feet fall soft on a carpet of spines;    Where the night shuts quick and the winds are cold    He haunts the deeps of the northern pines.    His eyes are eager, his teeth are keen,    As he slips at night through the bush like a snake,    Crouching and cringing, straight into the wind,    To leap with a grin on the fawn in the brake.    He falls like a cat on the mother grouse    Brooding her young in the wind-bent weeds,    Or listens to heed with a start of greed    The bittern booming from river reeds.    He's the symbol of hunger the whole earth through,    His spectre sits at the door or cave,    And the homeless hear with a thrill of fear    The sound of his wind-swept voice on the air.ABANDONED ON THE TRAIL    A poor old horse with down-cast mien and sad wild eyes,    Stood by the lonely trail--and oh!    He was so piteous lean.    He seemed to look a mild surprise    At all mankind that we should treat him so.    How hardily he struggled up the trail    And through the streams    All men should know.    Yet now abandoned to the wolf, his waiting foe,    He stood in silence, as an old man dreams.    And as his master left him, this he seemed to say:    "You leave me helpless by the path;    I do not curse you, but I pray    Defend me from the wolves' wild wrath!"    And yet his master rode away!CHAPTER XDOWN THE BULKLEY VALLEYAs we rose to the top of the divide which lies between the twocrossings of the Bulkley, a magnificent view of the coast range againlightened the horizon. In the foreground a lovely lake lay. On theshore of this lake stood a single Indian shack occupied by ahalf-dozen children and an old woman. They were all wretchedlyclothed in graceless rags, and formed a bitter and depressingcontrast to the magnificence of nature.One of the lads could talk a little Chinook mixed with English."How far is it to the ford?" I asked of him."White man say, mebbe-so six, mebbe-so nine mile."Knowing the Indian's vague idea of miles, I said:--"How _long_ before we reach the ford? Sit-kum sun?" which is to saynoon.He shook his head."Klip sun come. Me go-hyak make canoe. Me felly."By which he meant: "You will arrive at the ford by sunset. I willhurry on and build a raft and ferry you over the stream."With an axe and a sack of dried fish on his back and a poor oldshot-gun in his arm, he led the way down the trail at a slappingpace. He kept with us till dinner-time, however, in order to get somebread and coffee.Like the _Jicarilla_ Apaches, these people have discovered thevirtues of the inner bark of the black pine. All along the trail weretrees from which wayfarers had lunched, leaving a great strip of thewhite inner wood exposed."Man heap dry--this muck-a-muck heap good," said the young fellow, ashe handed me a long strip to taste. It was cool and sweet to thetongue, and on a hot day would undoubtedly quench thirst. The boytook it from the tree by means of a chisel-shaped iron after theheavy outer bark has been hewed away by the axe.All along the trail were tree trunks whereon some loitering youngSiwash had delineated a human face by a few deft and powerful strokesof the axe, the sculptural planes of cheeks, brow, and chin beingindicated broadly but with truth and decision. Often by some old campa tree would bear on a planed surface the rude pictographs, so thatthose coming after could read the number, size, sex, and success athunting of those who had gone before. There is something Japanese, itseems to me, in this natural taste for carving among all theNorthwest people.All about us was now riotous June. The season was incredibly warm andforward, considering the latitude. Strawberries were in bloom, birdswere singing, wild roses appeared in miles and in millions, plum andcherry trees were white with blossoms--in fact, the splendor andradiance of Iowa in June. A beautiful lake occupied our left nearlyall day.As we arrived at the second crossing of the Bulkley about sixo'clock, our young Indian met us with a sorrowful face."Stick go in chuck. No canoe. Walk stick."A big cottonwood log had fallen across the stream and layhalf-submerged and quivering in the rushing river. Over this log ahalf-dozen men were passing like ants, wet with sweat, "bucking"their outfits across. The poor Siwash was out of a job andexceedingly sorrowful."This is the kind of picnic we didn't expect," said one of the youngmen, as I rode up to see what progress they were making.We took our turn at crossing the tree trunk, which was submergednearly a foot deep with water running at mill-race speed, and resumedthe trail, following running water most of the way over a very goodpath. Once again we had a few hours' positive enjoyment, with nosense of being in a sub-arctic country. We could hardly convinceourselves that we were in latitude 54. The only peculiarity which Inever quite forgot was the extreme length of the day. At 10.30 atnight it was still light enough to write. No sooner did it get darkon one side of the hut than it began to lighten on the other. Theweather was gloriously cool, crisp, and invigorating, and whenever wehad sound soil under our feet we were happy.The country was getting each hour more superbly mountainous. Greatsnowy peaks rose on all sides. The coast range, lofty, roseate, dim,and far, loomed ever in the west, but on our right a group of othergiants assembled, white and stern. A part of the time we threaded ourway through fire-devastated forests of fir, and then as suddenlyburst out into tracts of wild roses with beautiful open spaces ofwaving pea-vine on which our horses fed ravenously.We were forced to throw up our tent at every meal, so intolerable hadthe mosquitoes become. Here for the first time our horses wereseverely troubled by myriads of little black flies. They were small,but resembled our common house flies in shape, and were exceedinglyvenomous. They filled the horses' ears, and their sting producedminute swellings all over the necks and breasts of the poor animals.Had it not been for our pennyroyal and bacon grease, the bay horsewould have been eaten raw.We overtook the trampers again at Chock Lake. They were thin, theirlegs making sharp creases in their trouser legs--I could see that asI neared them. They were walking desperately, reeling from side toside with weakness. There was no more smiling on their faces. Oneman, the smaller, had the countenance of a wolf, pinched in round thenose. His bony jaw was thrust forward resolutely. The taller man waslimping painfully because of a shoe which had gone to one side. Theirpacks were light, but their almost incessant change of position gaveevidence of pain and great weariness.I drew near to ask how they were getting along. The tall man, with alook of wistful sadness like that of a hungry dog, said, "Not verywell.""How are you off for grub?""Nothing left but some beans and a mere handful of flour."I invited them to a "square meal" a few miles farther on, and inorder to help them forward I took one of their packs on my horse. Iinferred that they would take turns at the remaining pack and so keeppace with us, for we were dropping steadily now--down, down throughthe most beautiful savannas, with fine spring brooks rushing from themountain's side. Flowers increased; the days grew warmer; it began tofeel like summer. The mountains grew ever mightier, looming cloudlikeat sunset, bearing glaciers on their shoulders. We were almostcompletely happy--but alas, the mosquitoes! Their hum silenced thesongs of the birds; their feet made the mountains of no avail. Theotherwise beautiful land became a restless hell for the unprotectedman or beast. It was impossible to eat or sleep without some defence,and our pennyroyal salve was invaluable. It enabled us to travel withsome degree of comfort, where others suffered martyrdom.At noon Burton made up a heavy mess, in expectation of the trampers,who had fallen a little behind. The small man came into view first,for he had abandoned his fellow-traveller. This angered me, and I wasminded to cast the little sneak out of camp, but his pinched andhungry face helped me to put up with him. I gave him a smart lectureand said, "I supposed you intended to help the other man, or Iwouldn't have relieved you of a pound."The other toiler turned up soon, limping, and staggering withweakness. When dinner was ready, they came to the call like a coupleof starving dogs. The small man had no politeness left. He gorgedhimself like a wolf. He fairly snapped the food down his throat. Thetall man, by great effort, contrived to display some knowledge ofbetter manners. As they ate, I studied them. They were blotched bymosquito bites and tanned to a leather brown. Their thin hands werelike claws, their doubled knees seemed about to pierce their trouserlegs."Yes," said the taller man, "the mosquitoes nearly eat us up. We canonly sleep in the middle of the day, or from about two o'clock in themorning till sunrise. We walk late in the evening--till nine orten--and then sit in the smoke till it gets cold enough to drive awaythe mosquitoes. Then we try to sleep. But the trouble is, when it iscold enough to keep them off, it's too cold for us to sleep.""What did you do during the late rains?" I inquired."Oh, we kept moving most of the time. At night we camped under a firtree by the trail and dried off. The mosquitoes didn't bother us somuch then. We were wet nearly all the time."I tried to get at his point of view, his justification for suchsenseless action, but could only discover a sort of blind beliefthat something would help him pull through. He had gone to theCaribou mines to find work, and, failing, had pushed on towardHazleton with a dim hope of working his way to Teslin Lake and to theKlondike. He started with forty pounds of provisions and three orfour dollars in his pocket. He was now dead broke, and his provisionsalmost gone.Meanwhile, the smaller man made no sign of hearing a word. He ate andate, till my friend looked at me with a comical wink. We fed himstaples--beans, graham bread, and coffee--and he slowly but surelyreached the bottom of every dish. He did not fill up, he simply"wiped out" the cooked food. The tall man was not far behind him.As he talked, I imagined the life they had led. At first the trailwas good, and they were able to make twenty miles each day. Theweather was dry and warm, and sleeping was not impossible. Theycamped close beside the trail when they grew tired--I had seen andrecognized their camping-places all along. But the rains came on, andthey were forced to walk all day through the wet shrubs with thewater dripping from their ragged garments. They camped at nightbeneath the firs (for the ground is always dry under a fir), where afire is easily built. There they hung over the flame, drying theirclothing and their rapidly weakening shoes. The mosquitoes swarmedupon them bloodily in the shelter and warmth of the trees, for theyhad no netting or tent. Their meals were composed of tea, a fewhastily stewed beans, and a poor quality of sticky camp bread. Theirsleep was broken and fitful. They were either too hot or too cold,and the mosquitoes gave way only when the frost made slumberdifficult. In the morning they awoke to the necessity of putting ontheir wet shoes, and taking the muddy trail, to travel as long asthey could stagger forward.In addition to all this, they had no maps, and knew nothing of theirwhereabouts or how far it was to a human habitation. Their onlycomfort lay in the passing of outfits like mine. From such as I, they"rustled food" and clothing. The small man did not even thank us forthe meal; he sat himself down for a smoke and communed with hisstomach. The tall man was plainly worsted. His voice had a plaintivedroop. His shoe gnawed into his foot, and his pack was visiblyheavier than that of his companion.We were two weeks behind our schedule, and our own flour sack was notmuch bigger than a sachet-bag, but we gave them some rice and part ofour beans and oatmeal, and they moved away.We were approaching sea-level, following the Bulkley, which flows ina northwesterly direction and enters the great Skeena River at rightangles, just below its three forks. Each hour the peaks seemed toassemble and uplift. The days were at their maximum, the sun setshortly after eight, but it was light until nearly eleven. At middaythe sun was fairly hot, but the wind swept down from the mountainscool and refreshing. I shall not soon forget those radiant meadows,over which the far mountains blazed in almost intolerable splendor;it was too perfect to endure. Like the light of the sun lingering onthe high peaks with most magical beauty, it passed away to be seen nomore.In the midst of these grandeurs we lost one of our horses. Whenever ahorse breaks away from his fellows on the trail, it is pretty safe toinfer he has "hit the back track." As I went out to round up thehorses, "Major Grunt" was nowhere to be found. He had strayed fromthe bunch and we inferred had started back over the trail. We trailedhim till we met one of the trampers, who assured us that no horse hadpassed him in the night, for he had been camped within six feet ofthe path.Up to this time there had been no returning footsteps, and it waseasy to follow the horse so long as he kept to the trail, but thetramper's report was positive--no horse had passed him. We turnedback and began searching the thickets around the camp.We toiled all day, not merely because the horse was exceedinglyvaluable to us, but also for the reason that he had a rope attachedto his neck and I was afraid he might become entangled in the fallentimber and so starve to death.The tall tramper, who had been definitely abandoned by his partner,was a sad spectacle. He was blotched by mosquito bites, thin and weakwith hunger, and his clothes hung in tatters. He had just aboutreached the limit of his courage, and though we were uncertain of ourhorses, and our food was nearly exhausted, we gave him all the ricewe had and some fruit and sent him on his way.Night came, and still no signs of "Major Grunt." It began to look asthough some one had ridden him away and we should be forced to go onwithout him. This losing of a horse is one of the accidents whichmake the trail so uncertain. We were exceedingly anxious to get on.There was an oppressive warmth in the air, and flies and mosquitoeswere the worst we had ever seen. Altogether this was a dark day onour calendar.After we had secured ourselves in our tents that night the sound ofthe savage insects without was like the roaring of a far-offhailstorm. The horses rolled in the dirt, snorted, wheeled madly,stamped, shook their heads, and flung themselves again and again onthe ground, giving every evidence of the most terrible suffering. "Ifthis is to continue," I said to my partner, "I shall quit, and eitherkill all my horses or ship them out of the country. I will not havethem eaten alive in this way."It was impossible to go outside to attend to them. Nothing could bedone but sit in gloomy silence and listen to the drumming of theirfrantic feet on the turf as they battled against their invisiblefoes. At last, led by old Ladrone, they started off at a hobblinggallop up the trail."Well, we are in for it now," I remarked, as the footsteps died away."They've hit the back trail, and we'll have another day's hard workto catch 'em and bring 'em back. However, there's no use worrying.The mosquitoes would eat us alive if we went out now. We might justas well go to sleep and wait till morning." Sleep was difficult underthe circumstances, but we dozed off at last.As we took their trail in the cool of the next morning, we found thehorses had taken the back trail till they reached an open hillside,and had climbed to the very edge of the timber. There they were allin a bunch, with the exception of "Major Grunt," of whom we had notrace.With a mind filled with distressing pictures of the lost horseentangled in his rope, and lying flat on his side hidden among thefallen tree trunks, there to struggle and starve, I reluctantly gaveorders for a start, with intent to send an Indian back to search forhim.After two hours' smart travel we came suddenly upon the little Indianvillage of Morricetown, which is built beside a narrow cañon throughwhich the Bulkley rushes with tremendous speed. Here high on thelevel grassy bank we camped, quite secure from mosquitoes, andsurrounded by the curious natives, who showed us where to find woodand water, and brought us the most beautiful spring salmon, andpotatoes so tender and fine that the skin could be rubbed from themwith the thumb. They were exactly like new potatoes in the States.Out of this, it may be well understood, we had a most satisfyingdinner. Summer was in full tide. Pieplant was two feet high, andstrawberries were almost ripe.Calling the men of the village around me, I explained inPigeon-English and worse Chinook that I had lost a horse, and that Iwould give five dollars to the man who would bring him to me. Theyall listened attentively, filled with joy at a chance to earn so muchmoney. At last the chief man of the village, a very good-lookingfellow of twenty-five or thirty, said to me: "All light, me go, mefetch 'um. You stop here. Mebbe-so, klip-sun, I come bling horse."His confidence relieved us of anxiety, and we had a very pleasant dayof it, digesting our bountiful meal of salmon and potatoes, andmending up our clothing. We were now pretty ragged and very brown,but in excellent health.Late in the afternoon a gang of road-cutters (who had been sent outby the towns interested in the route) came into town from Hazleton,and I had a talk with the boss, a very decent fellow, who gave a grimreport of the trail beyond. He said: "Nobody knows anything aboutthat trail. Jim Deacon, the head-man of our party when we leftHazleton, was only about seventy miles out, and cutting fallen timberlike a man chopping cord wood, and sending back for more help. We arenow going back to bridge and corduroy the places we had no time tofix as we came."Morricetown was a superb spot, and Burton was much inclined to stayright there and prospect the near-by mountains. So far as a merecasual observer could determine, this country offers every inducementto prospectors. It is possible to grow potatoes, hay, and oats,together with various small fruits, in this valley, and if goldshould ever be discovered in the rushing mountain streams, it wouldbe easy to sustain a camp and feed it well.Long before sunset an Indian came up to us and smilingly said, "Youhoss--come." And a few minutes later the young ty-ee came riding intotown leading "Major Grunt," well as ever, but a little sullen. He hadtaken the back trail till he came to a narrow and insecure bridge.There he had turned up the stream, going deeper and deeper into the"stick," as the Siwash called the forest. I paid the reward gladly,and Major took his place among the other horses with no sign of joy.DO YOU FEAR THE WIND?    Do you fear the force of the wind,    The slash of the rain?    Go face them and fight them,    Be savage again.    Go hungry and cold like the wolf,        Go wade like the crane.    The palms of your hands will thicken,    The skin of your cheek will tan,    You'll grow ragged and weary and swarthy,        But you'll walk like a man!CHAPTER XIHAZLETON. MIDWAY ON THE TRAILWe were now but thirty miles from Hazleton, where our second bill ofsupplies was waiting for us, and we were eager to push on. Taking theadvice of the road-gang we crossed the frail suspension bridge (whichthe Indians had most ingeniously constructed out of logs and piecesof old telegraph wire) and started down the west side of the river.Every ravine was filled by mountain streams' foam--white with speed.We descended all day and the weather grew more and more summer-likeeach mile. Ripe strawberries lured us from the warm banks. For thefirst time we came upon great groves of red cedar under which thetrail ran very muddy and very slippery by reason of the hard roots ofthe cedars which never decay. Creeks that seemed to me a good fieldfor placer mining came down from the left, but no one stopped to domore than pan a little gravel from a cut bank or a bar.At about two o'clock of the second day we came to the Indian villageof Hagellgate, which stands on the high bank overhanging the roaringriver just before it empties into the Skeena. Here we got news of thetramp who had fallen in exhaustion and was being cared for by theIndians.Descending swiftly we came to the bank of the river, which was wide,tremendously swift and deep and cold. Rival Indian ferry companiesbid for our custom, each man extolling his boat at the expense of the"old canoe--no good" of his rivals.The canoes were like those to be seen all along the coast, that is tosay they had been hollowed from cottonwood or pine trees andafterward steamed and spread by means of hot water to meet themaker's idea of the proper line of grace and speed. They were reallybeautiful and sat the water almost as gracefully as the birch-barkcanoe of the Chippewas. At each end they rose into a sort of neck,which terminated often in a head carved to resemble a deer or somefabled animal. Some of them had white bands encircling the throat ofthis figurehead. Their paddles were short and broad, but light andstrong.These canoes are very seaworthy. As they were driven across the swiftwaters, they danced on the waves like leaves, and the boatmen bent totheir oars with almost desperate energy and with most excited outcry.Therein is expressed a mighty difference between the Siwash and theplains Indian. The Cheyenne, the Sioux, conceal effort, or fear, orenthusiasm. These little people chattered and whooped at each otherlike monkeys. Upon hearing them for the first time I imagined theywere losing control of the boat. Judging from their accent they wereshrieking phrases like these:--"Quick, quick! Dig in deep, Joe. Scratch now, we're goingdown--whoop! Hay, now! All together--swing her, dog-gone ye--SWINGHER! Now straight--keep her straight! Can't ye see that eddy? Whoop,whoop! Let out a link or two, you spindle-armed child. Now _quick_ orwe're lost!"While the other men seemed to reply in kind: "Oh, rats, we're amakin' it. Head her toward that bush. Don't get scared--trustme--I'll sling her ashore!"A plains Indian, under similar circumstances, would have strainedevery muscle till his bones cracked, before permitting himself toshow effort or excitement.With all their confusion and chatter these little people were alwaysmasters of the situation. They came out right, no matter how savagethe river, and the Bulkley at this point was savage. Every drop ofwater was in motion. It had no eddies, no slack water. Its momentumwas terrific. In crossing, the boatmen were obliged to pole theircanoes far up beyond the point at which they meant to land; then, atthe word, they swung into the rushing current and pulled like fiendsfor the opposite shore. Their broad paddles dipped so rapidly theyresembled paddle-wheels. They kept the craft head-on to the current,and did not attempt to charge the bank directly, but swung-tobroadside. In this way they led our horses safely across, and came upsmiling each time.We found Hazleton to be a small village composed mainly of Indians,with a big Hudson Bay post at its centre. It was situated on a lovelygreen flat, but a few feet above the Skeena, which was a majesticflood at this point. There were some ten or fifteen outfits campedin and about the village, resting and getting ready for the last halfof the trail. Some of the would-be miners had come up the river inthe little Hudson Bay steamer, which makes two or three trips a year,and were waiting for her next trip in order to go down again.The town was filled with gloomy stories of the trail. No one knew itscondition. In fact, it had not been travelled in seventeen years,except by the Indians on foot with their packs of furs. The roadparty was ahead, but toiling hard and hurrying to open a way for us.As I now reread all the advance literature of this "prairie route," Iperceived how skilfully every detail with regard to the last half ofthe trail had been slurred over. We had been led into a sort of sack,and the string was tied behind us.The Hudson Bay agent said to me with perfect frankness, "There's noone in this village, except one or two Indians, who's ever been overthe trail, or who can give you any information concerning it." Hefurthermore said, "A large number of these fellows who are startingin on this trip with their poor little cayuses will never reach theStikeen River, and might better stop right here."Feed was scarce here as everywhere, and we were forced to camp on thetrail, some two miles above the town. In going to and from our tentwe passed the Indian burial ground, which was very curious andinteresting to me. It was a veritable little city of the dead, withstreets of tiny, gayly painted little houses in which the silent andmotionless ones had been laid in their last sleep. Each tomb was ashelter, a roof, and a tomb, and upon each the builder had lavishedhis highest skill in ornament. They were all vivid with paint andcarving and lattice work. Each builder seemed trying to outdo hisneighbor in making a cheerful habitation for his dead.More curious still, in each house were the things which the dead hadparticularly loved. In one, a trunk contained all of a girl'smuch-prized clothing. A complete set of dishes was visible inanother, while in a third I saw a wash-stand, bowl, pitcher, andmirror. There was something deeply touching to me in all this. Theyare so poor, their lives are so bare of comforts, that theconsecration of these articles to the dead seemed a greater sacrificethan we, who count ourselves civilized, would make. Each chair, ortable, or coat, or pair of shoes, costs many skins. The set offurniture meant many hard journeys in the cold, long days oftrailing, trapping, and packing. The clothing had a high money value,yet it remained undisturbed. I saw one day a woman and two younggirls halt to look timidly in at the window of a newly erected tomb,but only for a moment; and then, in a panic of fear and awe, theyhurried away.The days which followed were cold and gloomy, quite in keeping withthe grim tales of the trail. Bodies of horses and mules, drowned inthe attempt to cross the Skeena, were reported passing the wharf atthe post. The wife of a retired Indian agent, who claimed to havebeen over the route many years ago, was interviewed by my partner.After saying that it was a terrible trail, she sententiously endedwith these words, "Gentlemen, you may consider yourselvesexplorers."I halted a very intelligent Indian who came riding by our camp. "Howfar to Teslin Lake?" I asked.He mused. "Maybe so forty days, maybe so thirty days. Me think fortydays.""Good feed? Hy-u muck-a-muck?"He looked at me in silence and his face grew a little graver. "Ha--lomuck-a-muck (no feed). Long time no glass. Hy-yu stick (woods). Hy-uriver--all day swim."Turning to Burton, I said, "Here we get at the truth of it. This manhas no reason for lying. We need another horse, and we need fiftypounds more flour."One by one the outfits behind us came dropping down into Hazleton inlong trains of weary horses, some of them in very bad condition. Manyof the goldseekers determined to "quit." They sold their horses asbest they could to the Indians (who were glad to buy them), and hiredcanoes to take them to the coast, intent to catch one of the steamerswhich ply to and fro between Skagway and Seattle.But one by one, with tinkling bells and sharp outcry of drivers,other outfits passed us, cheerily calling: "Good luck! See youlater," all bound for the "gold belt." Gloomy skies continued to fillthe imaginative ones with forebodings, and all day they could be seenin groups about the village discussing ways and means. Quarrels brokeout, and parties disbanded in discouragement and bitterness. The roadto the golden river seemed to grow longer, and the precious sand moreelusive, from day to day. Here at Hazleton, where they had hoped toreach a gold region, nothing was doing. Those who had visited theKisgagash Mountains to the north were lukewarm in their reports, andno one felt like stopping to explore. The cry was, "On to Dawson."Here in Hazleton I came upon the lame tramp. He had secured lodgingin an empty shack and was being helped to food by some citizens inthe town for whom he was doing a little work. Seeing me pass hecalled to me and began to inquire about the trail.I read in the gleam of his eye an insane resolution to push forward.This I set about to check. "If you wish to commit suicide, start onthis trail. The four hundred miles you have been over is a summerpicnic excursion compared to that which is now to follow. My adviceto you is to stay right where you are until the next Hudson Baysteamer comes by, then go to the captain and tell him just how youare situated, and ask him to carry you down to the coast. You areinsane to think for a moment of attempting the four hundred miles ofunknown trail between here and Glenora, especially without a cent inyour pocket and no grub. You have no right to burden the otheroutfits with your needs."This plain talk seemed to affect him and he looked aggrieved. "Butwhat can I do? I have no money and no work."I replied in effect: "Whatever you do, you can't afford to enter uponthis trail, and you can't expect men who are already short of grub tofeed and take care of you. There's a chance for you to work your wayback to the coast on the Hudson Bay steamer. There's only starvationon the trail."As I walked away he called after me, but I refused to return. I hadthe feeling in spite of all I had said that he would attempt torustle a little grub and make his start on the trail. The wholegoldseeking movement was, in a way, a craze; he was simply an extremedevelopment of it.It seemed necessary to break camp in order not to be eaten up by theSiwash dogs, whose peculiarities grew upon me daily. They were indeedstrange beasts. They seemed to have no youth. I never saw them play;even the puppies were grave and sedate. They were never in a hurryand were not afraid. They got out of our way with the least possibleexertion, looking meekly reproachful or snarling threateningly at us.They were ever watchful. No matter how apparently deep their slumber,they saw every falling crumb, they knew where we had hung our fish,and were ready as we turned our backs to make away with it. It wasimpossible to leave anything eatable for a single instant. Nothingbut the sleight of hand of a conjurer could equal the mystery oftheir stealing.After buying a fourth pack animal and reshoeing all our horses, wegot our outfit into shape for the long, hard drive which lay beforeus. Every ounce of superfluous weight, every tool, every article notabsolutely essential, was discarded and its place filled with food.We stripped ourselves like men going into battle, and on the thirdday lined up for Teslin Lake, six hundred miles to the north.SIWASH GRAVES    Here in their tiny gayly painted homes    They sleep, these small dead people of the streams,    Their names unknown, their deeds forgot,    Their by-gone battles lost in dreams.    A few short days and we who laugh    Will be as still, will lie as low    As utterly in dark as they who rot    Here where the roses blow.    They fought, and loved, and toiled, and died,    As all men do, and all men must.    Of what avail? we at the end    Fall quite as shapelessly to dust.LINE UP, BRAVE BOYS    The packs are on, the cinches tight,    The patient horses wait,    Upon the grass the frost lies white,    The dawn is gray and late.    The leader's cry rings sharp and clear,    The campfires smoulder low;    Before us lies a shallow mere,    Beyond, the mountain snow.          "_Line up, Billy, line up, boys,_              _The east is gray with coming day,_              _We must away, we cannot stay._              _Hy-o, hy-ak, brave boys!_"    Five hundred miles behind us lie,    As many more ahead,    Through mud and mire on mountains high    Our weary feet must tread.    So one by one, with loyal mind,    The horses swing to place,    The strong in lead, the weak behind,    In patient plodding grace.          "_Hy-o, Buckskin, brave boy, Joe!_              _The sun is high,_              _The hid loons cry:_              _Hy-ak--away! Hy-o!_"CHAPTER XIICROSSING THE BIG DIVIDEOur stay at Hazleton in some measure removed the charm of the firstview. The people were all so miserably poor, and the hosts ofhowling, hungry dogs made each day more distressing. The mountainsremained splendid to the last; and as we made our start I looked backupon them with undiminished pleasure.We pitched tent at night just below the ford, and opposite anotherIndian village in which a most mournful medicine song was going on,timed to the beating of drums. Dogs joined with the mourning of thepeople with cries of almost human anguish, to which the beat of thepassionless drum added solemnity, and a sort of inexorable marchingrhythm. It seemed to announce pestilence and flood, and made thebeautiful earth a place of hunger and despair.I was awakened in the early dawn by a singular cry repeated again andagain on the farther side of the river. It seemed the voice of awoman uttering in wailing; chant the most piercing agony ofdespairing love. It ceased as the sun arose and was heard no more. Itwas difficult to imagine such anguish in the bustle of the brightmorning. It seemed as though it must have been an illusion--a dreamof tragedy.In the course of an hour's travel we came down to the sandy bottom ofthe river, whereon a half-dozen fine canoes were beached and waitingfor us. The skilful natives set us across very easily, although itwas the maddest and wildest of all the rivers we had yet seen. Wecrossed the main river just above the point at which the west forkenters. The horses were obliged to swim nearly half a mile, and someof them would not have reached the other shore had it not been forthe Indians, who held their heads out of water from the sterns of thecanoes, and so landed them safely on the bar just opposite the littlevillage called Kispyox, which is also the Indian name of the westfork.The trail made off up the eastern bank of this river, which was ascharming as any stream ever imagined by a poet. The water wasgray-green in color, swift and active. It looped away in mostsplendid curves, through opulent bottom lands, filled with wildroses, geranium plants, and berry blooms. Openings alternated withbeautiful woodlands and grassy meadows, while over and beyond allrose the ever present mountains of the coast range, deep blue andsnow-capped.There was no strangeness in the flora--on the contrary, everythingseemed familiar. Hazel bushes, poplars, pines, all growth wasamazingly luxuriant. The trail was an Indian path, graceful and fullof swinging curves. We had passed beyond the telegraph wire of theold trail.Early in the afternoon we passed some five or six outfits camped on abeautiful grassy bank overlooking the river, and forming a mostsatisfying picture. The bells on the grazing horses were tinkling,and from sparkling fires, thin columns of smoke arose. Some of theyoung men were bathing, while others were washing their shirts in thesunny stream. There was a cheerful sound of whistling and rattling oftinware mingled with the sound of axes. Nothing could be more jocund,more typical, of the young men and the trail. It was one of the fewpleasant camps of the long journey.It was raining when we awoke, but before noon it cleared sufficientlyto allow us to pack. We started at one, though the bushes were loadedwith water, and had we not been well clothed in waterproof, we shouldhave been drenched to the bone. We rode for four hours over a goodtrail, dodging wet branches in the pouring rain. It lightened atfive, and we went into camp quite dry and comfortable.We unpacked near an Indian ranch belonging to an old man and hiswife, who came up at once to see us. They were good-looking, ruggedold souls, like powerful Japanese. They could not speak Chinook, andwe could not get much out of them. The old wife toted a monstrous bigsalmon up the hill to sell to us, but we had more fish than we couldeat, and were forced to decline. There was a beautiful spring justback of the cabin, and the old man seemed to take pleasure in havingus get our water from it. Neither did he object to our horses feedingabout his house, where there was very excellent grass. It was acharming camping-place, wild flowers made the trail radiant even inthe midst of rain. The wild roses grew in clumps of sprays as highas a horse's head.Just before we determined to camp we had passed three or four outfitsgrouped together on the sward on the left bank of the river. As werode by, one of the men had called to me saying: "You had bettercamp. It is thirty miles from here to feed." To this I had merelynodded, giving it little attention; but now as we sat around ourcampfire, Burton brought the matter up again: "If it is thirty milesto feed, we will have to get off early to-morrow morning and make asbig a drive as we can, while the horses are fresh, and then make thelatter part of the run on empty stomachs.""Oh, I think they were just talking for our special benefit," Ireplied."No, they were in earnest. One of them came out to see me. He said hegot his pointer from the mule train ahead of us. Feed is going to bevery scarce, and the next run is fully thirty miles."I insisted it could not be possible that we should go at once fromthe luxuriant pea-vine and bluejoint into a thirty-mile stretch ofcountry where nothing grew. "There must be breaks in the forest wherewe can graze our horses."It rained all night and in the morning it seemed as if it had settledinto a week's downpour. However, we were quite comfortable withplenty of fresh salmon, and were not troubled except with the thoughtof the mud which would result from this rainstorm. We were fallingsteadily behind our schedule each day, but the horses were feedingand gaining strength--"And when we hit the trail, we will hit ithard," I said to Burton.It was Sunday. The day was perfectly quiet and peaceful, like a rainySunday in the States. The old Indian below kept to his house all day,not visiting us. It is probable that he was a Catholic. The dogs cameabout us occasionally; strange, solemn creatures that they are, theyhad the persistence of hunger and the silence of burglars.It was raining when we awoke Monday morning, but we were now restlessto get under way. We could not afford to spend another day waiting inthe rain. It was gloomy business in camp, and at the first sign oflightening sky we packed up and started promptly at twelve o'clock.That ride was the sternest we had yet experienced. It was likeswimming in a sea of green water. The branches sloshed us withblinding raindrops. The mud spurted under our horses' hoofs, the skywas gray and drizzled moisture, and as we rose we plunged into everdeepening forests. We left behind us all hazel bushes, alders, wildroses, and grasses. Moss was on every leaf and stump: the forestbecame savage, sinister and silent, not a living thing but ourselvesmoved or uttered voice.This world grew oppressive with its unbroken clear greens, itsdripping branches, its rotting trees; its snake-like roots halfburied in the earth convinced me that our warning was well-born. Atlast we came into upper heights where no blade of grass grew, and wepushed on desperately, on and on, hour after hour. We began to sufferwith the horses, being hungry and cold ourselves. We plunged intobottomless mudholes, slid down slippery slopes of slate, and leapedinnumerable fallen logs of fir. The sky had no more pity than themossy ground and the desolate forest. It was a mocking land, a landof green things, but not a blade of grass: only austere trees andnoxious weeds.During the day we met an old man so loaded down I could not tellwhether he was man, woman, or beast. A sort of cap or wide cloth bandwent across his head, concealing his forehead. His huge pack loomedover his shoulders, and as he walked, using two paddles as canes, heseemed some anomalous four-footed beast of burden.As he saw us he threw off his pack to rest and stood erect, a sturdyman of sixty, with short bristling hair framing a kindly resoluteface. He was very light-hearted. He shook hands with me, saying,"Kla-how-ya," in answer to my, "Kla-how-ya six," which is to say,"How are you, friend?" He smiled, pointed to his pack, and said,"Hy-u skin." His season had been successful and he was going now tosell his catch. A couple of dogs just behind carried each twentypounds on their backs. We were eating lunch, and I invited him to sitand eat. He took a seat and began to parcel out the food in twopiles."He has a companion coming," I said to my partner. In a few moments aboy of fourteen or fifteen came up, carrying a pack that would testthe strength of a powerful white man. He, too, threw off his load andat a word from the old man took a seat at the table. They sharedexactly alike. It was evident that they were father and son.A few miles farther on we met another family, two men, a woman, aboy, and six dogs, all laden in proportion. They were all handsomerthan the Siwashes of the Fraser River. They came from the head-watersof the Nasse, they said. They could speak but little Chinook and noEnglish at all. When I asked in Chinook, "How far is it to feed forour horses?" the woman looked first at our thin animals, then at us,and shook her head sorrowfully; then lifting her hands in the mostdramatic gesture she half whispered, "Si-ah, si-ah!" That is to say,"Far, very far!"Both these old people seemed very kind to their dogs, which were fatand sleek and not related to those I had seen in Hazleton. When theold man spoke to them, his voice was gentle and encouraging. At theword they all took up the line of march and went off down the hilltoward the Hudson Bay store, there to remain during the summer. Wepushed on, convinced by the old woman's manner that our long trailwas to be a gloomy one.Night began to settle over us at last, adding the final touches ofuncertainty and horror to the gloom. We pushed on with necessarycruelty, forcing the tired horses to their utmost, searching everyravine and every slope for a feed; but only ferns and strange greenpoisonous plants could be seen. We were angling up the side of thegreat ridge which separated the west fork of the Skeena River fromthe middle fork. It was evident that we must cross this high divideand descend into the valley of the middle fork before we could hopeto feed our horses.However, just as darkness was beginning to come on, we came to analmost impassable slough in the trail, where a small stream descendedinto a little flat marsh and morass. This had been used as acamping-place by others, and we decided to camp, because to travel,even in the twilight, was dangerous to life and limb.It was a gloomy and depressing place to spend the night. There wasscarcely level ground enough to receive our camp. The wood was soggyand green. In order to reach the marsh we were forced to lead ourhorses one by one through a dangerous mudhole, and once through thisthey entered upon a quaking bog, out of which grew tufts of grasswhich had been gnawed to the roots by the animals which had precededthem; only a rank bottom of dead leaves of last year's growth wasleft for our tired horses. I was deeply anxious for fear they wouldcrowd into the central bog in their efforts to reach the uncroppedgreen blades which grew out of reach in the edge of the water. Theywere ravenous with hunger after eight hours of hard labor.Our clothing was wet to the inner threads, and we were tired andmuddy also, but our thoughts were on the horses rather than uponourselves. We soon had a fire going and some hot supper, and by teno'clock were stretched out in our beds for the night.I have never in my life experienced a gloomier or more distressingcamp on the trail. My bed was dry and warm, but I could not forgetour tired horses grubbing about in the chilly night on that desolatemarsh.A CHILD OF THE SUN    Give me the sun and the sky,    The wide sky. Let it blaze with light,    Let it burn with heat--I care not.    The sun is the blood of my heart,    The wind of the plain my breath.    No woodsman am I. My eyes are set    For the wide low lines. The level rim    Of the prairie land is mine.    The semi-gloom of the pointed firs,    The sleeping darks of the mountain spruce,    Are prison and poison to such as I.    In the forest I long for the rose of the plain,    In the dark of the firs I die.IN THE GRASS    O to lie in long grasses!    O to dream of the plain!    Where the west wind sings as it passes    A weird and unceasing refrain;    Where the rank grass wallows and tosses,    And the plains' ring dazzles the eye;    Where hardly a silver cloud bosses    The flashing steel arch of the sky.    To watch the gay gulls as they flutter    Like snowflakes and fall down the sky,    To swoop in the deeps of the hollows,    Where the crow's-foot tosses awry;    And gnats in the lee of the thickets    Are swirling like waltzers in glee    To the harsh, shrill creak of the crickets    And the song of the lark and the bee.    O far-off plains of my west land!    O lands of winds and the free,    Swift deer--my mist-clad plain!    From my bed in the heart of the forest,    From the clasp and the girdle of pain    Your light through my darkness passes;    To your meadows in dreaming I fly    To plunge in the deeps of your grasses,    To bask in the light of your sky!CHAPTER XIIITHE SILENT FORESTS OF THE DREAD SKEENAWe were awake early and our first thought was of our horses. Theywere quite safe and cropping away on the dry stalks with patientdiligence. We saddled up and pushed on, for food was to be had onlyin the valley, whose blue and white walls we could see far ahead ofus. After nearly six hours' travel we came out of the forest, outinto the valley of the middle fork of the Skeena, into sunlight andgrass in abundance, where we camped till the following morning,giving the horses time to recuperate.We were done with smiling valleys--that I now perceived. We werecoming nearer to the sub-arctic country, grim and desolate. The viewwas magnificent, but the land seemed empty and silent except ofmosquitoes, of which there were uncounted millions. On our right justacross the river rose the white peaks of the Kisgagash Mountains.Snow was still lying in the gullies only a few rods above us.The horses fed right royally and soon forgot the dearth of the bigdivide. As we were saddling up to move the following morning, severaloutfits came trailing down into the valley, glad as we had been ofthe splendid field of grass. They were led by a grizzled oldAmerican, who cursed the country with fine fervor."I can stand any kind of a country," said he, "except one wherethere's no feed. And as near's I can find out we're in fer hell's owntime fer feed till we reach them prairies they tell about."After leaving this flat, we had the Kuldo (a swift and powerfulriver) to cross, but we found an old Indian and a girl camped on theopposite side waiting for us. The daughter, a comely child aboutsixteen years of age, wore a calico dress and "store" shoes. She wasa self-contained little creature, and clearly in command of the boat,and very efficient. It was no child's play to put the light canoeacross such a stream, but the old man, with much shouting and undercommand of the girl, succeeded in crossing six times, carrying us andour baggage. As we were being put across for the last time it becamenecessary for some one to pull the canoe through the shallow water,and the little girl, without hesitation, leaped out regardless of newshoes, and tugged at the rope while the old man poled at the stern,and so we were landed.As a recognition of her resolution I presented her with a dollar,which I tried to make her understand was her own, and not to be givento her father. Up to that moment she had been very shy and rathersullen, but my present seemed to change her opinion of us, and shebecame more genial at once. She was short and sturdy, and her littlefootsteps in the trail were strangely suggestive of civilization.After leaving the river we rose sharply for about three miles. Thisbrought us to the first notice on the trail which was signed by theroad-gang, an ambiguous scrawl to the effect that feed was to be veryscarce for a long, long way, and that we should feed our horsesbefore going forward. The mystery of the sign lay in the fact that nofeed was in sight, and if it referred back to the flat, then it wasin the nature of an Irish bull.There was a fork in the trail here, and another notice informed usthat the trail to the right ran to the Indian village of Kuldo. Rainthreatened, and as it was late and no feed promised, I determined tocamp. Turning to the right down a tremendously steep path (the horsessliding on their haunches), we came to an old Indian fishing villagebuilt on a green shelf high above the roaring water of the Skeena.The people all came rushing out to see us, curious but veryhospitable. Some of the children began plucking grasses for thehorses, but being unaccustomed to animals of any kind, not one wouldapproach within reach of them. I tried, by patting Ladrone andputting his head over my shoulder, to show them how gentle he was,but they only smiled and laughed as much as to say, "Yes, that is allright for _you_, but we are afraid." They were all very good-looking,smiling folk, but poorly dressed. They seemed eager to show us wherethe best grass grew, demanded nothing of us, begged nothing, and didnot attempt to overcharge us. There were some eight or ten familiesin the cañon, and their houses were wretched shacks, mere lodges ofslabs with vents in the peak. So far as they could, they conformed tothe ways of white men.Here they dwell by this rushing river in the midst of a gloomy andtrackless forest, far removed from any other people of any sort. Theywere but a handful of human souls. As they spoke little Chinook andalmost no English, it was difficult to converse with them. They hadlost the sign language or seemed not to use it. Their village wasbuilt here because the cañon below offered a capital place forfishing and trapping, and the principal duty of the men was to watchthe salmon trap dancing far below. For the rest they hunt wildanimals and sell furs to the Hudson Bay Company at Hazleton, which istheir metropolis.They led us to the edge of the village and showed us where theroad-gang had set their tent, and we soon had a fire going in ourlittle stove, which was the amazement and delight of a circle of men,women, and children, but they were not intrusive and asked fornothing.Later in the evening the old man and the girl who had helped to ferryus across the Kuldo came down the hill and joined the circle of ourvisitors.She smiled as we greeted her and so did the father, who assured me hewas the ty-ee (boss) of the village, which he seemed to be.After our supper we distributed some fruit among the children, andamong the old women some hot coffee with sugar, which was a keendelight to them. Our desire to be friendly was deeply appreciated bythese poor people, and our wish to do them good was greater than ourmeans. The way was long before us and we could not afford to giveaway our supplies. How they live in winter I cannot understand;probably they go down the river to Hazleton.I began to dread the dark green dripping firs which seemed toencompass us like some vast army. They chilled me, oppressed me.Moreover, I was lame in every joint from the toil of crossing rivers,climbing steep hills, and dragging at cinches. I had walked downevery hill and in most cases on the sharp upward slopes in order torelieve Ladrone of my weight.As we climbed back to our muddy path next day, we were filled withdark forebodings of the days to come. We climbed all day, keeping thebench high above the river. The land continued silent. It was awilderness of firs and spruce pines. It was like a forest of bronze.Nothing but a few rose bushes and some leek-like plants rose from themossy floor, on which the sun fell, weak and pale, in rare places. Nobeast or bird uttered sound save a fishing eagle swinging through thecañon above the roaring water.In the gloom the voice of the stream became a raucous roar. On everyside cold and white and pitiless the snowy peaks lifted above theserrate rim of the forest.Life was scant here. In all the mighty spread of forest between thecontinental divide on the east and the coast range at the west thereare few living things, and these few necessarily centre in the warmopenings on the banks of the streams where the sunlight falls or inthe high valleys above the firs. There are no serpents and noinsects.As we mounted day by day we crossed dozens of swift little streamscold and gray with silt. Our rate of speed was very low. One of ourhorses became very weak and ill, evidently poisoned, and we wereforced to stop often to rest him. All the horses were weakening dayby day.Toward the middle of the third day, after crossing a stream whichcame from the left, the trail turned as if to leave the Skeenabehind. We were mighty well pleased and climbed sharply and withgreat care of our horses till we reached a little meadow at thesummit, very tired and disheartened, for the view showed only otherpeaks and endless waves of spruce and fir. We rode on under drizzlingskies and dripping trees. There was little sunshine and long lines ofheavily weighted gray clouds came crawling up the valley from the seato break in cold rain over the summits.The horses again grew hungry and weak, and it was necessary to usegreat care in crossing the streams. We were lame and sore with thetoil of the day, and what was more depressing found ourselves oncemore upon the banks of the Skeena, where only an occasional bunch ofbluejoint could be found. The constant strain of watching the horsesand guiding them through the mud began to tell on us both. There wasnow no moment of ease, no hour of enjoyment. We had set ourselvesgrimly to the task of bringing our horses through alive. We no longerrode, we toiled in silence, leading our saddle-horses on which wehad packed a part of our outfit to relieve the sick and starvingpackhorses.On the fourth day we took a westward shoot from the river, andfollowing the course of a small stream again climbed heavily up theslope. Our horses were now so weak we could only climb a few rods ata time without rest. But at last, just as night began to fall, wecame upon a splendid patch of bluejoint, knee-deep and rich. It washigh on the mountain side, on a slope so steep that the horses couldnot lie down, so steep that it was almost impossible to set our tent.We could not persuade ourselves to pass it, however, and so made thebest of it. Everywhere we could see white mountains, to the south, tothe west, to the east."Now we have left the Skeena Valley," said Burton."Yes, we have seen the last of the Skeena," I replied, "and I'm gladof it. I never want to see that gray-green flood again."A part of the time that evening we spent in picking the thorns ofdevil's-club out of our hands. This strange plant I had not seenbefore, and do not care to see it again. In plunging through themudholes we spasmodically clutched these spiny things. Ladrone nippedsteadily at the bunch of leaves which grew at the top of the twistedstalk. Again we plunged down into the cold green forest, following astream whose current ran to the northeast. This brought us once againto the bank of the dreaded Skeena. The trail was "punishing," and thehorses plunged and lunged all day through the mud, over logs, stones,and roots. Our nerves quivered with the torture of piloting ourmistrusted desperate horses through these awful pitfalls. We werestill in the region of ferns and devil's-club.We allowed no feed to escape us. At any hour of the day, whenever wefound a bunch of grass, no matter if it were not bigger than a broom,we stopped for the horses to graze it and so we kept them on theirfeet.At five o'clock in the afternoon we climbed to a low, marshy lakewhere an Indian hunter was camped. He said we would find feed onanother lake some miles up, and we pushed on, wallowing through mudand water of innumerable streams, each moment in danger of leaving ahorse behind. I walked nearly all day, for it was torture to me aswell as to Ladrone to ride him over such a trail. Three of our horsesnow showed signs of poisoning, two of them walked with a sprawlingaction of the fore legs, their eyes big and glassy. One was too weakto carry anything more than his pack-saddle, and our going had a sortof sullen desperation in it. Our camps were on the muddy ground,without comfort or convenience.Next morning, as I swung into the saddle and started at the head ofmy train, Ladrone threw out his nose with a sharp indrawn squeal ofpain. At first I paid little attention to it, but it came again--andthen I noticed a weakness in his limbs. I dismounted and examined himcarefully. He, too, was poisoned and attacked by spasms. It was asorrowful thing to see my proud gray reduced to this condition. Hiseyes were dilated and glassy and his joints were weak. We could notstop, we could not wait, we must push on to feed and open ground; andso leading him carefully I resumed our slow march.But at last, just when it seemed as though we could not go anyfarther with our suffering animals, we came out of the poisonousforest upon a broad grassy bottom where a stream was flowing to thenorthwest. We raised a shout of joy, for it seemed this must be abranch of the Nasse. If so, we were surely out of the clutches of theSkeena. This bottom was the first dry and level ground we had seensince leaving the west fork, and the sun shone. "Old man, the worstof our trail is over," I shouted to my partner. "The land looks moreopen to the north. We're coming to that plateau they told us of."Oh, how sweet, fine, and sunny the short dry grass seemed to us afterour long toilsome stay in the sub-aqueous gloom of the Skeenaforests! We seemed about to return to the birds and the flowers.Ladrone was very ill, but I fed him some salt mixed with lard, andafter a doze in the sun he began to nibble grass with the others, andat last stretched out on the warm dry sward to let the glorious sunsoak into his blood. It was a joyous thing to us to see the faithfulones revelling in the healing sunlight, their stomachs filled at lastwith sweet rich forage. We were dirty, ragged, and lame, and ourhands were calloused and seamed with dirt, but we were strong andhearty.We were high in the mountains here. Those little marshy lakes andslow streams showed that we were on a divide, and to our minds couldbe no other than the head-waters of the Nasse, which has a watershedof its own to the sea. We believed the worst of our trip to be over.THE FAITHFUL BRONCOS    They go to certain death--to freeze,    To grope their way through blinding snow,    To starve beneath the northern trees--    Their curse on us who made them go!    They trust and we betray the trust;    They humbly look to us for keep.    The rifle crumbles them to dust,    And we--have hardly grace to weep    As they line up to die.THE WHISTLING MARMOT    On mountains cold and bold and high,    Where only golden eagles fly,    He builds his home against the sky.    Above the clouds he sits and whines,    The morning sun about him shines;    Rivers loop below in shining lines.    No wolf or cat may find him there,    That winged corsair of the air,    The eagle, is his only care.    He sees the pink snows slide away,    He sees his little ones at play,    And peace fills out each summer day.    In winter, safe within his nest,    He eats his winter store with zest,    And takes his young ones to his breast.CHAPTER XIVTHE GREAT STIKEEN DIVIDEAt about eight o'clock the next morning, as we were about to line upfor our journey, two men came romping down the trail, carrying packson their backs and taking long strides. They were "hitting the highplaces in the scenery," and seemed to be entirely absorbed in thework. I hailed them and they turned out to be two young men fromDuluth, Minnesota. They were without hats, very brown, very hairy,and very much disgusted with the country.For an hour we discussed the situation. They were the first white menwe had met on the entire journey, almost the only returningfootsteps, and were able to give us a little information of thetrail, but only for a distance of about forty miles; beyond this theyhad not ventured."We left our outfits back here on a little lake--maybe you saw ourIndian guide--and struck out ahead to see if we could find thosesplendid prairies they were telling us about, where the caribou andthe moose were so thick you couldn't miss 'em. We've been forty milesup the trail. It's all a climb, and the very worst yet. You'll comefinally to a high snowy divide with nothing but mountains on everyside. There _is_ no prairie; it's all a lie, and we're going back toHazleton to go around by way of Skagway. Have you any idea where weare?""Why, certainly; we're in British Columbia.""But where? On what stream?""Oh, that is a detail," I replied. "I consider the little camp onwhich we are camped one of the head-waters of the Nasse; but we'renot on the Telegraph Trail at all. We're more nearly in line with theold Dease Lake Trail.""Why is it, do you suppose, that the road-gang ahead of us haven'tleft a single sign, not even a word as to where we are?""Maybe they can't write," said my partner."Perhaps they don't know where they are at, themselves," said I."Well, that's exactly the way it looks to me.""Are there any outfits ahead of us?""Yes, old Bob Borlan's about two days up the slope with his train ofmules, working like a slave to get through. They're all getting shortof grub and losing a good many horses. You'll have to work your waythrough with great care, or you'll lose a horse or two in gettingfrom here to the divide.""Well, this won't do. So-long, boys," said one of the young fellows,and they started off with immense vigor, followed by their handsomedogs, and we lined up once more with stern faces, knowing now that aterrible trail for at least one hundred miles was before us. Therewas no thought of retreat, however. We had set our feet to thisjourney, and we determined to go.After a few hours' travel we came upon the grassy shore of anotherlittle lake, where the bells of several outfits were tinklingmerrily. On the bank of a swift little river setting out of the lake,a couple of tents stood, and shirts were flapping from the limbs ofnear-by willows. The owners were "The Man from Chihuahua," hispartner, the blacksmith, and the two young men from Manchester, NewHampshire, who had started from Ashcroft as markedly tenderfoot asany men could be. They had been lambasted and worried into perfectefficiency as packers and trailers, and were entitled torespect--even the respect of "The Man from Chihuahua."They greeted us with jovial outcry."Hullo, strangers! Where ye think you're goin'?""Goin' crazy," replied Burton."You look it," said Bill."By God, we was all sure crazy when we started on this damn trail,"remarked the old man. He was in bad humor on account of his horses,two of which were suffering from poisoning. When anything touched hishorses, he was "plum irritable."He came up to me very soberly. "Have you any idee where we're at?""Yes--we're on the head-waters of the Nasse.""Are we on the Telegraph Trail?""No; as near as I can make out we're away to the right of thetelegraph crossing."Thereupon we compared maps. "It's mighty little use to look atmaps--they're all drew by guess--an'--by God, anyway," said the oldfellow, as he ran his grimy forefinger over the red line whichrepresented the trail. "We've been a slantin' hellwards ever since wecrossed the Skeeny--I figure it we're on the old Dease Lake Trail."To this we all agreed at last, but our course thereafter was by nomeans clear."If we took the old Dease Lake Trail we're three hundred miles fromTelegraph Creek yit--an' somebody's goin' to be hungry before we getin," said the old trailer. "I'd like to camp here for a few days andfeed up my horses, but it ain't safe--we got 'o keep movin'. We'vebeen on this damn trail long enough, and besides grub is gittin'lighter all the time.""What do you think of the trail?" asked Burton."I've been on the trail all my life," he replied, "an' I never was insuch a pizen, empty no-count country in my life. Wasn't that bigdivide hell? Did ye ever see the beat of that fer a barren? No moregrass than a cellar. Might as well camp in a cistern. I wish I couldlay hands on the feller that called this 'The Prairie Route'--they'dsure be a dog-fight right here."The old man expressed the feeling of those of us who were too shy anddelicate of speech to do it justice, and we led him on to mostsatisfying blasphemy of the land and the road-gang."Yes, there's that road-gang sent out to put this trail intoshape--what have they done? You'd think they couldn't read orwrite--not a word to help us out."Partner and I remained in camp all the afternoon and all the nextday, although our travelling companions packed up and moved out thenext morning. We felt the need of a day's freedom from worry, and ourhorses needed feed and sunshine.Oh, the splendor of the sun, the fresh green grass, the ripplingwater of the river, the beautiful lake! And what joy it was to seeour horses feed and sleep. They looked distressingly thin and poorwithout their saddles. Ladrone was still weak in the ankle joints andthe arch had gone out of his neck, while faithful Bill, who nevermurmured or complained, had a glassy stare in his eyes, the lingeringeffects of poisoning. The wind rose in the afternoon, bringing to usa sound of moaning tree-tops, and somehow it seemed to be an auguryof better things--seemed to prophesy a fairer and dryer country tothe north of us. The singing of the leaves went to my heart with ahint of home, and I remembered with a start how absolutely windlessthe sullen forest of the Skeena had been.Near by a dam was built across the river, and a fishing trap made outof willows was set in the current. Piles of caribou hair showed thatthe Indians found game in the autumn. We took time to explore someold fishing huts filled with curious things,--skins, toboggans,dog-collars, cedar ropes, and many other traps of small value toanybody. Most curious of all we found some flint-lock muskets madeexactly on the models of one hundred years ago, but dated 1883! Itseemed impossible that guns of such ancient models should bemanufactured up to the present date; but there they were allcarefully marked "London, 1883."It was a long day of rest and regeneration. We took a bath in theclear, cold waters of the stream, washed our clothing and hung it upto dry, beat the mud out of our towels, and so made ready for theonward march. We should have stayed longer, but the ebbing away ofour grub pile made us apprehensive. To return was impossible.THE CLOUDS    Circling the mountains the gray clouds go    Heavy with storms as a mother with child,    Seeking release from their burden of snow    With calm slow motion they cross the wild--    Stately and sombre, they catch and cling    To the barren crags of the peaks in the west,    Weary with waiting, and mad for rest.THE GREAT STIKEEN DIVIDE    A land of mountains based in hills of fir,    Empty, lone, and cold. A land of streams    Whose roaring voices drown the whirr    Of aspen leaves, and fill the heart with dreams    Of dearth and death. The peaks are stern and white    The skies above are grim and gray,    And the rivers cleave their sounding way    Through endless forests dark as night,    Toward the ocean's far-off line of spray.CHAPTER XVIN THE COLD GREEN MOUNTAINSThe Nasse River, like the Skeena and the Stikeen, rises in theinterior mountains, and flows in a south-westerly direction, breakingthrough the coast range into the Pacific Ocean, not far from themouth of the Stikeen.It is a much smaller stream than the Skeena, which is, moreover,immensely larger than the maps show. We believed we were about topass from the watershed of the Nasse to the east fork of the Iskoot,on which those far-shining prairies were said to lie, with theirflowery meadows rippling under the west wind. If we could only reachthat mystical plateau, our horses would be safe from all disease.We crossed the Cheweax, a branch of the Nasse, and after climbingbriskly to the northeast along the main branch we swung around over ahigh wooded hog-back, and made off up the valley along the north andlesser fork. We climbed all day, both of us walking, leading ourhorses, with all our goods distributed with great care over the sixhorses. It was a beautiful day overhead--that was the onlycompensation. We were sweaty, eaten by flies and mosquitoes, andcovered with mud. All day we sprawled over roots, rocks, and logs,plunging into bogholes and slopping along in the running water, whichin places had turned the trail into an aqueduct. The men from Duluthhad told no lie.After crawling upward for nearly eight hours we came upon a littlepatch of bluejoint, on the high side of the hill, and there camped inthe gloom of the mossy and poisonous forest. By hard and persistentwork we ticked off nearly fifteen miles, and judging from the stream,which grew ever swifter, we should come to a divide in the course offifteen or twenty miles.The horses being packed light went along fairly well, although it wasa constant struggle to get them to go through the mud. Old Ladronewalking behind me groaned with dismay every time we came to one ofthose terrible sloughs. He seemed to plead with me, "Oh, my master,don't send me into that dreadful hole!"But there was no other way. It must be done, and so Burton's sharpcry would ring out behind and our little train would go in one afterthe other, plunging, splashing, groaning, struggling through.Ladrone, seeing me walk a log by the side of the trail, wouldsometimes follow me as deftly as a cat. He seemed to think his rightto avoid the mud as good as mine. But as there was always danger ofhis slipping off and injuring himself, I forced him to wallow in themud, which was as distressing to me as to him.The next day we started with the determination to reach the divide."There is no hope of grass so long as we remain in this forest," saidBurton. "We must get above timber where the sun shines to get anyfeed for our horses. It is cruel, but we must push them to-day justas long as they can stand up, or until we reach the grass."Nothing seemed to appall or disturb my partner; he was always readyto proceed, his voice ringing out with inflexible resolution.It was one of the most laborious days of all our hard journey. Hourafter hour we climbed steadily up beside the roaring gray-whitelittle stream, up toward the far-shining snowfields, which blazedback the sun like mirrors. The trees grew smaller, the river bedseemed to approach us until we slumped along in the running water. Atlast we burst out into the light above timber line. Around usporcupines galloped, and whistling marmots signalled with shrillvehemence. We were weak with fatigue and wet with icy water to theknees, but we pushed on doggedly until we came to a little mound ofshort, delicious green grass from which the snow had melted. On thiswe stopped to let the horses graze. The view was magnificent, andsomething wild and splendid came on the wind over the snowy peaks andsmooth grassy mounds.We were now in the region of great snowfields, under which roaredswift streams from still higher altitudes. There were thousands ofmarmots, which seemed to utter the most intense astonishment at theinexplicable coming of these strange creatures. The snow in thegullies had a curious bloody line which I could not account for. Alittle bird high up here uttered a sweet little whistle, so sad, sofull of pleading, it almost brought tears to my eyes. In form itresembled a horned lark, but was smaller and kept very close to theground.We reached the summit at sunset, there to find only other mountainsand other enormous gulches leading downward into far blue cañons. Itwas the wildest land I have ever seen. A country unmapped,unsurveyed, and unprospected. A region which had known only anoccasional Indian hunter or trapper with his load of furs on his waydown to the river and his canoe. Desolate, without life, green andwhite and flashing illimitably, the gray old peaks aligned themselvesrank on rank until lost in the mists of still wilder regions.From this high point we could see our friends, the Manchester boys,on the north slope two or three miles below us at timber line. Weakin the knees, cold and wet and hungry as we were, we determined topush down the trail over the snowfields, down to grass and water. Notmuch more than forty minutes later we came out upon a comparativelylevel spot of earth where grass was fairly good, and where thewind-twisted stunted pines grew in clumps large enough to furnishwood for our fires and a pole for our tent. The land was meshed withroaring rills of melting snow, and all around went on the incessantsignalling of the marmots--the only cheerful sound in all the widegreen land.We had made about twenty-three miles that day, notwithstandingtremendous steeps and endless mudholes mid-leg deep. It was thegreatest test of endurance of our trip.We had the good luck to scare up a ptarmigan (a sort of piebaldmountain grouse), and though nearly fainting with hunger, we heldourselves in check until we had that bird roasted to a turn. I shallnever experience greater relief or sweeter relaxation of rest thanthat I felt as I stretched out in my down sleeping bag for twelvehours' slumber.I considered that we were about one hundred and ninety miles fromHazleton, and that this must certainly be the divide between theSkeena and the Stikeen. The Manchester boys reported finding somevery good pieces of quartz on the hills, and they were all out withspade and pick prospecting, though it seemed to me they showed butvery little enthusiasm in the search."I b'lieve there's gold here," said "Chihuahua," "but who's goin' tostay here and look fer it? In the first place, you couldn't work fermor'n 'bout three months in the year, and it 'ud take ye the othernine months fer to git yer grub in. Them hills look to me to bemineralized, but I ain't honin' to camp here."This seemed to be the general feeling of all the other prospectors,and I did not hear that any one else went so far even as to dig ahole.As near as I could judge there seemed to be three varieties of"varmints" galloping around over the grassy slopes of this highcountry. The largest of these, a gray and brown creature with atawny, bristling mane, I took to be a porcupine. Next in size werethe giant whistlers, who sat up like old men and signalled, like oneboy to another. And last and least, and more numerous than all, werethe smaller "chucks" resembling prairie dogs. These animals togetherwith the ptarmigan made up the inhabitants of these lofty slopes.I searched every green place on the mountains far and near with myfield-glasses, but saw no sheep, caribou, or moose, although one ortwo were reported to have been killed by others on the trail. Theptarmigan lived in the matted patches of willow. There were a greatmany of them, and they helped out our monotonous diet veryopportunely. They moved about in pairs, the cock very loyal to thehen in time of danger; but not even this loyalty could save him.Hunger such as ours considered itself very humane in stopping shortof the slaughter of the mother bird. The cock was easilydistinguished by reason of his party-colored plumage and his pinkeyes.We spent the next forenoon in camp to let our horses feed up, andincidentally to rest our own weary bones. All the forenoon great,gray clouds crushed against the divide behind us, flinging themselvesin rage against the rocks like hungry vultures baffled in theirchase. We exulted over their impotence. "We are done with you, youstorms of the Skeena--we're out of your reach at last!"We were confirmed in this belief as we rode down the trail, which wasfairly pleasant except for short periods, when the clouds leaped thesnowy walls behind and scattered drizzles of rain over us. Later theclouds thickened, the sky became completely overcast, and myexultation changed to dismay, and we camped at night as desolate asever, in the rain, and by the side of a little marsh on which thehorses could feed only by wading fetlock deep in the water. We werewet to the skin, and muddy and tired.I could no longer deceive myself. Our journey had become a grim racewith the wolf. Our food grew each day scantier, and we were forced tomove each day and every day, no matter what the sky or trail mightbe. Going over our food carefully that night, we calculated that wehad enough to last us ten days, and if we were within one hundred andfifty miles of the Skeena, and if no accident befell us, we would beable to pull in without great suffering.But accidents on the trail are common. It is so easy to lose a coupleof horses, we were liable to delay and to accident, and the chanceswere against us rather than in our favor. It seemed as though thetrail would never mend. We were dropping rapidly down through dwarfpines, down into endless forests of gloom again. We had splashed,slipped, and tumbled down the trail to this point with three horsesweak and sick. The rain had increased, and all the brightness of themorning on the high mountain had passed away. For hours we had walkedwithout a word except to our horses, and now night was falling inthick, cold rain. As I plodded along I saw in vision and with greatlonging the plains, whose heat and light seemed paradise by contrast.The next day was the Fourth of July, and such a day! It rained allthe forenoon, cold, persistent, drizzling rain. We hung around thecampfire waiting for some let-up to the incessant downpour. Wediscussed the situation. I said: "Now, if the stream in the cañonbelow us runs to the left, it will be the east fork of the Iskoot,and we will then be within about one hundred miles of Glenora. If itruns to the right, Heaven only knows where we are."The horses, chilled with the rain, came off the sloppy marsh to standunder the trees, and old Ladrone edged close to the big fire to shareits warmth. This caused us to bring in the other horses and put themclose to the fire under the big branches of the fir tree. It wasdeeply pathetic to watch the poor worn animals, all life and spiritgone out of them, standing about the fire with drooping heads andhalf-closed eyes. Perhaps they dreamed, like us, of the beautiful,warm, grassy hills of the south.THE UTE LOVER    Beneath the burning brazen sky,    The yellowed tepes stand.    Not far away a singing river    Sets through the sand.    Within the shadow of a lonely elm tree    The tired ponies keep.    The wild land, throbbing with the sun's hot magic,    Is rapt as sleep.    From out a clump of scanty willows    A low wail floats.    The endless repetition of a lover's    Melancholy notes;    So sad, so sweet, so elemental,    All lover's pain    Seems borne upon its sobbing cadence--    The love-song of the plain.    From frenzied cry forever falling,    To the wind's wild moan,    It seems the voice of anguish calling    Alone! alone!    Caught from the winds forever moaning    On the plain,    Wrought from the agonies of woman    In maternal pain,    It holds within its simple measure    All death of joy,    Breathed though it be by smiling maiden    Or lithe brown boy.    It hath this magic, sad though its cadence    And short refrain;    It helps the exiled people of the mountain    Endure the plain;    For when at night the stars aglitter    Defy the moon,    The maiden listens, leans to seek her lover    Where waters croon.    Flute on, O lithe and tuneful Utah,    Reply brown jade;    There are no other joys secure to either    Man or maid.    Soon you are old and heavy hearted,    Lost to mirth;    While on you lies the white man's gory    Greed of earth.    Strange that to me that burning desert    Seems so dear.    The endless sky and lonely mesa,    Flat and drear,    Calls me, calls me as the flute of Utah    Calls his mate--    This wild, sad, sunny, brazen country,    Hot as hate.    Again the glittering sky uplifts star-blazing;    Again the stream    From out the far-off snowy mountains    Sings through my dream;    And on the air I hear the flute-voice calling    The lover's croon,    And see the listening, longing maiden    Lit by the moon.DEVIL'S CLUB    It is a sprawling, hateful thing,    Thorny and twisted like a snake,    Writhing to work a mischief, in the brake    It stands at menace, in its cling    Is danger and a venomed sting.    It grows on green and slimy slopes,    It is a thing of shades and slums,    For passing feet it wildly gropes,    And loops to catch all feet that run    Seeking a path to sky and sun.IN THE COLD GREEN MOUNTAINS    In the cold green mountains where the savage torrents roared,    And the clouds were gray above us,    And the fishing eagle soared,    Where no grass waved, where no robins cried,    There our horses starved and died,    In the cold green mountains.    In the cold green mountains,    Nothing grew but moss and trees,    Water dripped and sludgy streamlets    Trapped our horses by the knees.    Where we slipped, slid, and lunged,    Mired down and wildly plunged    Toward the cold green mountains!CHAPTER XVITHE PASSING OF THE BEANSAt noon, the rain slacking a little, we determined to pack up, andwith such cheer as we could called out, "Line up, boys--line up!"starting on our way down the trail.After making about eight miles we came upon a number of outfitscamped on the bank of the river. As I rode along on my gray horse,for the trail there allowed me to ride, I passed a man seatedgloomily at the mouth of his tent. To him I called with an assumptionof jocularity I did not feel, "Stranger, where are you bound for?"He replied, "The North Pole.""Do you expect to get there?""Sure," he replied.Riding on I met others beside the trail, and all wore a similar lookof almost sullen gravity. They were not disposed to joke with me, andperceiving something to be wrong, I passed on without further remark.When we came down to the bank of the stream, behold it ran to theright. And I could have sat me down and blasphemed with the rest. Inow understood the gloom of the others. _We were still in the valleyof the inexorable Skeena._ It could be nothing else; this tremendousstream running to our right could be no other than the head-waters ofthat ferocious flood which no surveyor has located. It is immenselylarger and longer than any map shows.We crossed the branch without much trouble, and found some beautifulbluejoint-grass on the opposite bank, into which we joyfully turnedour horses. When they had filled their stomachs, we packed up andpushed on about two miles, overtaking the Manchester boys on theside-hill in a tract of dead, burned-out timber, a cheerless spot.In speaking about the surly answer I had received from the man on thebanks of the river, I said: "I wonder why those men are camped there?They must have been there for several days."Partner replied: "They are all out of grub and are waiting for someone to come by to whack-up with 'em. One of the fellows came out andtalked with me and said he had nothing left but beans, and tried tobuy some flour of me."This opened up an entirely new line of thought. I understood now thatwhat I had taken for sullenness was the dejection of despair. The waywas growing gloomy and dark to them. They, too, were racing with thewolf.We had one short moment of relief next day as we entered a lovelylittle meadow and camped for noon. The sun shone warm, the grass wasthick and sweet. It was like late April in the central West--cool,fragrant, silent. Aisles of peaks stretched behind us and before us.We were still high in the mountains, and the country was less woodedand more open. But we left this beautiful spot and entered again on amorass. It was a day of torture to man and beast. The land continuedsilent. There were no toads, no butterflies, no insects of any kind,except a few mosquitoes, no crickets, no singing thing. I have neverseen a land so empty of life. We had left even the whistling marmotsentirely behind us.We travelled now four outfits together, with some twenty-five horses.Part of the time I led with Ladrone, part of the time "The Man fromChihuahua" took the lead, with his fine strong bays. If a horse gotdown we all swarmed around and lifted him out, and when any questionof the trail came up we held "conferences of the powers."We continued for the most part up a wide mossy and grassy riverbottom covered with water. We waded for miles in water to our ankles,crossing hundreds of deep little rivulets. Occasionally a horse wentdown into a hole and had to be "snailed out," and we were wet andcovered with mud all day. It was a new sort of trail and a terror.The mountains on each side were very stately and impressive, but wecould pay little attention to views when our horses were miring downat every step.We could not agree about the river. Some were inclined to the beliefthat it was a branch of the Stikeen, the old man was sure it was"Skeeny." We were troubled by a new sort of fly, a littleorange-colored fellow whose habits were similar to those of thelittle black fiends of the Bulkley Valley. They were very poisonousindeed, and made our ears swell up enormously--the itching andburning was well-nigh intolerable. We saw no life at all save onegrouse hen guarding her young. A paradise for game it seemed, but nogame. A beautiful grassy, marshy, and empty land. We passed over onelow divide after another with immense snowy peaks thickening allaround us. For the first time in over two hundred miles we were allable to ride. Whistling marmots and grouse again abounded. We had abird at every meal. The wind was cool and the sky was magnificent,and for the first time in many days we were able to take off our hatsand face the wind in exultation.Toward night, however, mosquitoes became troublesome in theirassaults, covering the horses in solid masses. Strange to say, noneof them, not even Ladrone, seemed to mind them in the least. We feltsure now of having left the Skeena forever. One day we passed over abeautiful little spot of dry ground, which filled us with delight; itseemed as though we had reached the prairies of the pamphlets. Wecamped there for noon, and though the mosquitoes were terrific wewere all chortling with joy. The horses found grass in plenty andplucked up spirits amazingly. We were deceived. In half an hour wewere in the mud again.The whole country for miles and miles in every direction was a seriesof high open valleys almost entirely above timber line. Thesevalleys formed the starting-points of innumerable small streams whichfell away into the Iskoot on the left, the Stikeen on the north, theSkeena on the east and south. These valleys were covered with grassand moss intermingled, and vast tracts were flooded with water fromfour to eight inches deep, through which we were forced to slop hourafter hour, and riding was practically impossible.As we were plodding along silently one day a dainty white gull camelilting through the air and was greeted with cries of joy by theweary drivers. More than one of them could "smell the salt water." Inimagination they saw this bird following the steamer up the Stikeento the first south fork, thence to meet us. It seemed only a shortride down the valley to the city of Glenora and the post-office.Each day we drove above timber line, and at noon were forced torustle the dead dwarf pine for fire. The marshes were green andfilled with exquisite flowers and mosses, little white and purplebells, some of them the most beautiful turquoise-green rising fromtufts of verdure like mignonette. I observed also a sort of crocusand some cheery little buttercups. The ride would have beenmagnificent had it not been for the spongy, sloppy marsh throughwhich our horses toiled. As it was, we felt a certain breadth andgrandeur in it surpassing anything we had hitherto seen. Our threeoutfits with some score of horses went winding through the wide,green, treeless valleys with tinkle of bells and sharp cry ofdrivers. The trail was difficult to follow, because in the openground each man before us had to take his own course, and there werefew signs to mark the line the road-gang had taken.It was impossible to tell where we were, but I was certain we wereupon the head-waters of some one of the many forks of the greatStikeen River. Marmots and a sort of little prairie dog continuedplentiful, but there was no other life. The days were bright andcool, resplendent with sun and rich in grass.Some of the goldseekers fired a salute with shotted guns when, poisedon the mountain side, they looked down upon a stream flowing to thenorthwest. But the joy was short-lived. The descent of thismountain's side was by all odds the most terrible piece of trail wehad yet found. It led down the north slope, and was oozy and slipperywith the melting snow. It dropped in short zigzags down through agrove of tangled, gnarled, and savage cedars and pines, whose rootswere like iron and filled with spurs that were sharp as chisels. Thehorses, sliding upon their haunches and unable to turn themselves inthe mud, crashed into the tangled pines and were in danger of beingtorn to pieces. For more than an hour we slid and slewed through thishorrible jungle of savage trees, and when we came out below we hadtwo horses badly snagged in the feet, but Ladrone was uninjured.We now crossed and recrossed the little stream, which dropped into adeep cañon running still to the northwest. After descending for somehours we took a trail which branched sharply to the northeast, andclimbed heavily to a most beautiful camping-spot between the peaks,with good grass, and water, and wood all around us.We were still uncertain of our whereabouts, but all the boys werefairly jubilant. "This would be a splendid camp for a few weeks,"said partner.That night as the sun set in incommunicable splendor over the snowypeaks to the west the empty land seemed left behind. We went to sleepwith the sound of a near-by mountain stream in our ears, and thevoice of an eagle sounding somewhere on the high cliffs.The next day we crossed another divide and entered another valleyrunning north. Being confident that this _was_ the Stikeen, we campedearly and put our little house up. It was raining a little. We haddescended again to the aspens and clumps of wild roses. It was goodto see their lovely faces once more after our long stay in the wild,cold valleys of the upper lands. The whole country seemed drier, andthe vegetation quite different. Indeed, it resembled some of theColorado valleys, but was less barren on the bottoms. There werestill no insects, no crickets, no bugs, and very few birds of anykind.All along the way on the white surface of the blazed trees weremessages left by those who had gone before us. Some of them wereprofane assaults upon the road-gang. Others were pathetic inquiries:"Where in hell are we?"--"How is this for a prairie route?"--"Whatriver is this, anyhow?" To these pencillings others had addedfacetious replies. There were also warnings and signs to help us keepout of the mud.We followed the same stream all day. Whether the Iskoot or not we didnot know. The signs of lower altitude thickened. Wild roses met usagain, and strawberry blossoms starred the sunny slopes. The grasswas dry and ripe, and the horses did not relish it after their longstay in the juicy meadows above. We had been wet every day for nearlythree weeks, and did not mind moisture now, but my shoes were rapidlygoing to pieces, and my last pair of trousers was frazzled to theknees.Nearly every outfit had lame horses like our old bay, hobbling alongbravely. Our grub was getting very light, which was a good thing forthe horses; but we had an occasional grouse to fry, and so as long asour flour held out we were well fed.It became warmer each day, and some little weazened berries appearedon the hillsides, the first we had seen, and they tasted mighty goodafter months of bacon and beans. We were taking some pleasure in thetrip again, and had it not been for the sores on our horses' feet andour scant larder we should have been quite at ease. Our course nowlay parallel to a range of peaks on our right, which we figured to bethe Hotailub Mountains. This settled the question of our position onthe map--we were on the third and not the first south fork of theStikeen and were a long way still from Telegraph Creek.THE LONG TRAIL    We tunnelled miles of silent pines,      Dark forests where the stillness was so deep    The scared wind walked a tip-toe on the spines,      And the restless aspen seemed to sleep.    We threaded aisles of dripping fir;      We climbed toward mountains dim and far,    Where snow forever shines and shines,      And only winds and waters are.    Red streams came down from hillsides crissed and crossed      With fallen firs; but on a sudden, lo!    A silver lakelet bound and barred      With sunset's clouds reflected far below.    These lakes so lonely were, so still and cool,      They burned as bright as burnished steel;    The shadowed pine branch in the pool      Was no less vivid than the real.    We crossed the great divide and saw      The sun-lit valleys far below us wind;    Before us opened cloudless sky; the raw,      Gray rain swept close behind.    We saw great glaciers grind themselves to foam;      We trod the moose's lofty home,    And heard, high on the yellow hills,      The wildcat clamor of his ills.    The way grew grimmer day by day,      The weeks to months stretched on and on;    And hunger kept, not far away,      A never failing watch at dawn.    We lost all reckoning of season and of time;      Sometimes it seemed the bitter breeze    Of icy March brought fog and rain,      And next November tempests shook the trees.    It was a wild and lonely ride.      Save the hid loon's mocking cry,    Or marmot on the mountain side,      The earth was silent as the sky.    All day through sunless forest aisles,      On cold dark moss our horses trod;    It was so lonely there for miles and miles,      The land seemed lost to God.    Our horses cut by rocks; by brambles torn,      Staggered onward, stiff and sore;    Or broken, bruised, and saddle-worn,      Fell in the sloughs to rise no more.    Yet still we rode right on and on,      And shook our clenched hands at the clouds,    Daring the winds of early dawn,      And the dread torrent roaring loud.    So long we rode, so hard, so far,      We seemed condemned by stern decree    To ride until the morning star      Should sink forever in the sea.    Yet now, when all is past, I dream      Of every mountain's shining cap.    I long to hear again the stream      Roar through the foam-white granite gap.    The pains recede. The joys draw near.      The splendors of great Nature's face    Make me forget all need, all fear,      And the long journey grows in grace.THE GREETING OF THE ROSES    We had been long in mountain snow,    In valleys bleak, and broad, and bare,    Where only moss and willows grow,    And no bird wings the silent air.    And so when on our downward way,    Wild roses met us, we were glad;    They were so girlish fair, so gay,    It seemed the sun had made them mad.CHAPTER XVIITHE WOLVES AND THE VULTURES ASSEMBLEAbout noon of the fiftieth day out, we came down to the bank of atremendously swift stream which we called the third south fork. On abroken paddle stuck in the sand we found this notice: "The trailcrosses here. Swim horses from the bar. It is supposed to be aboutninety miles to Telegraph Creek.--(Signed) The Mules."We were bitterly disappointed to find ourselves so far from ourdestination, and began once more to calculate on the length of timeit would take us to get out of the wilderness.Partner showed me the flour-sack which he held in one brawny fist. "Ibelieve the dern thing leaks," said he, and together we went over ourstore of food. We found ourselves with an extra supply of sugar,condensed cream, and other things which our friends the Manchesterboys needed, while they were able to spare us a little flour. Therewas a tacit agreement that we should travel together and standtogether. Accordingly we began to plan for the crossing of this swiftand dangerous stream. A couple of canoes were found cached in thebushes, and these would enable us to set our goods across, while weforced our horses to swim from a big bar in the stream above.While we were discussing these thing around our fires at night,another tramper, thin and weak, came into camp. He was a little manwith a curly red beard, and was exceedingly chipper and jocular forone in his condition. He had been out of food for some days, and hadbeen living on squirrels, ground-hogs, and such other small deer ashe could kill and roast along his way. He brought word ofconsiderable suffering among the outfits behind us, reporting "TheDutchman" to be entirely out of beans and flour, while others hadlost so many of their horses that all were in danger of starving todeath in the mountains.As he warmed up on coffee and beans, he became very amusing.He was hairy and ragged, but neat, and his face showed a certaindelicacy of physique. He, too, was a marked example of the craze to"get somewhere where gold is." He broke off suddenly in the midst ofhis story to exclaim with great energy: "I want to do two things, goback and get my boy away from my wife, and break the back of mybrother-in-law. He made all the trouble."Once and again he said, "I'm going to find the gold up here or lay mybones on the hills."In the midst of these intense phrases he whistled gayly or broke offto attend to his cooking. He told of his hard experiences, with prideand joy, and said, "Isn't it lucky I caught you just here?" andseemed willing to talk all night.In the morning I went over to the campfire to see if he were stillwith us. He was sitting in his scanty bed before the fire, mendinghis trousers. "I've just got to put a patch on right now or myknee'll be through," he explained. He had a neat little kit ofmaterials and everything was in order. "I haven't time to turn theedges of the patch under," he went on. "It ought to be done--youcan't make a durable patch unless you do. This 'housewife' my wifemade me when we was first married. I was peddlin' then in easternOregon. If it hadn't been for her brother--oh, I'll smash his facein, some day"--he held up the other trouser leg: "See that patch?Ain't that a daisy?--that's the way I ought to do. Say, looks like Iought to rustle enough grub out of all these outfits to last me intoGlenora, don't it?"We came down gracefully--we could not withstand such prattle. Theblacksmith turned in some beans, the boys from Manchester dividedtheir scanty store of flour and bacon, I brought some salt, somesugar, and some oatmeal, and as the small man put it away he chirpedand chuckled like a cricket. His thanks were mere words, his voicewas calm. He accepted our aid as a matter of course. No perfectlyreasonable man would ever take such frightful chances as this absurdlittle ass set his face to without fear. He hummed a little tune ashe packed his outfit into his shoulder-straps. "I ought to rattleinto Glenora on this grub, hadn't I?" he said.At last he was ready to be ferried across the river, which was swiftand dangerous. Burton set him across, and as he was about to depart Igave him a letter to post and a half-dollar to pay postage. My namewas written on the corner of the envelope. He knew me then and said,"I've a good mind to stay right with you; I'm something of a writermyself."I hastened to say that he could reach Glenora two or three days inadvance of us, for the reason that we were bothered with a lamehorse. In reality, we were getting very short of provisions and wereeven then on rations. "I think you'll overtake the Borland outfit," Isaid. "If you don't, and you need help, camp by the road till we comeup and we'll all share as long as there's anything to share. But youare in good trim and have as much grub as we have, so you'd betterspin along."He "hit the trail" with a hearty joy that promised well, and I neversaw him again. His cheery smile and unshrinking cheek carried himthrough a journey that appalled old packers with tents, plenty ofgrub, and good horses. To me he was simply a strongly accentuatedtype of the goldseeker--insanely persistent; blind to all danger,deaf to all warning, and doomed to failure at the start.The next day opened cold and foggy, but we entered upon a hard day'swork. Burton became the chief canoeman, while one of the Manchesterboys, stripped to the undershirt, sat in the bow to pull at thepaddle "all same Siwash." Burton's skill and good judgment enabled usto cross without losing so much as a buckle. Some of our poor lamehorses had a hard struggle in the icy current. At about 4 P.M. wewere able to line up in the trail on the opposite side. We pressed onup to the higher valleys in hopes of finding better feed, and campedin the rain about two miles from the ford. The wind came from thenorthwest with a suggestion of autumn in its uneasy movement. Theboys were now exceedingly anxious to get into the gold country. Theybegan to feel most acutely the passing of the summer. In the camp atnight the talk was upon the condition of Telegraph Creek and theTeslin Lake Trail.Rain, rain, rain! It seemed as though no day could pass without rain.And as I woke I heard the patter of fine drops on our tent roof. Theold man cursed the weather most eloquently, expressing the generalfeeling of the whole company. However, we saddled up and pushed on,much delayed by the lame horses.At about twelve o'clock I missed my partner's voice and looking aboutsaw only two of the packhorses following. Hitching those beside thetrail, I returned to find Burton seated beside the lame horse, whichcould not cross the slough. I examined the horse's foot and found athin stream of arterial blood spouting out."That ends it, Burton," I said. "I had hoped to bring all my horsesthrough, but this old fellow is out of the race. It is a question noweither of leaving him beside the trail with a notice to have himbrought forward or of shooting him out of hand."To this partner gravely agreed, but said, "It's going to be prettyhard lines to shoot that faithful old chap.""Yes," I replied, "I confess I haven't the courage to face him witha rifle after all these weeks of faithful service. But it must bedone. You remember that horse back there with a hole in his flank andhis head flung up? We mustn't leave this old fellow to be a prey tothe wolves. Now if you'll kill him you can set your price on theservice. Anything at all I will pay. Did you ever kill a horse?"Partner was honest. "Yes, once. He was old and sick and I believed itbetter to put him out of his suffering than to let him drag on.""That settles it, partner," said I. "Your hands are already imbuedwith gore--it must be done."He rose with a sigh. "All right. Lead him out into the thicket."I handed him the gun (into which I had shoved two steel-jacketedbullets, the kind that will kill a grizzly bear), and took the oldhorse by the halter. "Come, boy," I said, "it's hard, but it's theonly merciful thing." The old horse looked at me with such serenetrust and confidence, my courage almost failed me. His big brown eyeswere so full of sorrow and patient endurance. With some urging hefollowed me into the thicket a little aside from the trail. Turningaway I mounted Ladrone in order that I might not see what happened.There was a crack of a rifle in the bush--the sound of a heavy bodyfalling, and a moment later Burton returned with a coiled rope in hishand and a look of trouble on his face. The horses lined up againwith one empty place and an extra saddle topping the pony's pack. Itwas a sorrowful thing to do, but there was no better way. As I rodeon, looking back occasionally to see that my train was following, myheart ached to think of the toil the poor old horse hadundergone--only to meet death in the bush at the hands of his master.Relieved of our wounded horse we made good time and repassed beforenine o'clock several outfits that had overhauled us during ourtrouble. We rose higher and higher, and came at last into a grassycountry and to a series of small lakes, which were undoubtedly thesource of the second fork of the Stikeen. But as we had lost so muchtime during the day, we pushed on with all our vigor for a couple ofhours and camped about nine o'clock of a beautiful evening, with amagnificent sky arching us as if with a prophecy of better timesahead.The horses were now travelling very light, and our food supply wasreduced to a few pounds of flour and bread--we had no game andno berries. Beans were all gone and our bacon reduced to the lastshred. We had come to expect rain every day of our lives, and werefeeling a little the effects of our scanty diet of bread andbacon--hill-climbing was coming to be laborious. However, the way leddownward most of the time, and we were able to rack along at a verygood pace even on an empty stomach.During the latter part of the second day the trail led along a highridge, a sort of hog-back overlooking a small river valley on ourleft, and bringing into view an immense blue cañon far ahead of us."There lies the Stikeen," I called to Burton. "We're on the secondsouth fork, which we follow to the Stikeen, thence to the left toTelegraph Creek." I began to compose doggerel verses to express ourexultation.We were very tired and glad when we reached a camping-place. We couldnot stop on this high ridge for lack of water, although the feed wasvery good. We were forced to plod on and on until we at lastdescended into the valley of a little stream which crossed our path.The ground had been much trampled, but as rain was falling anddarkness coming on, there was nothing to do but camp.Out of our last bit of bacon grease and bread and tea we made oursupper. While we were camping, "The Wild Dutchman," a stalwart youngfellow we had seen once or twice on the trail, came by with a verysour visage. He went into camp near, and came over to see us. Hesaid: "I hain't had no pread for more dan a veek. I've nuttin' putpeans. If you can, let me haf a biscuit. By Gott, how goot dat vouldtaste."I yielded up a small loaf and encouraged him as best I could: "As Ifigure it, we are within thirty-five miles of Telegraph Creek; I'vekept a careful diary of our travel. If we've passed over the DeaseLake Trail, which is probably about four hundred miles from Hazletonto Glenora, we must be now within thirty-five miles of TelegraphCreek."I was not half so sure of this as I made him think; but it gave him agreat deal of comfort, and he went off very much enlivened.Sunday and no sun! It was raining when we awoke and the mosquitoeswere stickier than ever. Our grub was nearly gone, our horses thinand weak, and the journey uncertain. All ill things seemed toassemble like vultures to do us harm. The world was a grim place thatday. It was a question whether we were not still on the third southfork instead of the second south fork, in which case we were at leastone hundred miles from our supplies. If we were forced to cross themain Stikeen and go down on the other side, it might be even farther.The men behind us were all suffering, and some of them were sure tohave a hard time if such weather continued. At the same time I feltcomparatively sure of our ground.We were ragged, dirty, lame, unshaven, and unshorn--we were fightingfrom morning till night. The trail became more discouraging eachmoment that the rain continued to fall. There was little conversationeven between partner and myself. For many days we had moved inperfect silence for the most part, though no gloom or sullennessappeared in Burton's face. We were now lined up once more, taking thetrail without a word save the sharp outcry of the drivers hurryingthe horses forward, or the tinkle of the bells on the lead horse ofthe train.THE VULTURE    He wings a slow and watchful flight,    His neck is bare, his eyes are bright,    His plumage fits the starless night.    He sits at feast where cattle lie    Withering in ashen alkali,    And gorges till he scarce can fly.    But he is kingly on the breeze!    On rigid wing, in careless ease,    A soundless bark on viewless seas.    Piercing the purple storm cloud, he makes    The sun his neighbor, and shakes    His wrinkled neck in mock dismay,    And swings his slow, contemptuous way    Above the hot red lightning's play.    Monarch of cloudland--yet a ghoul of prey.CAMPFIRES1. _Popple_    A river curves like a bended bow,    And over it winds of summer lightly blow;    Two boys are feeding a flame with bark    Of the pungent popple. Hark!    They are uttering dreams. "I    Will go hunt gold toward the western sky,"    Says the older lad; "I know it is there,    For the rainbow shows just where    It is. I'll go camping, and take a pan,    And shovel gold, when I'm a man."2. _Sage Brush_    The burning day draws near its end,    And on the plain a man and his friend    Sit feeding an odorous sage-brush fire.    A lofty butte like a funeral pyre,    With the sun atop, looms high    In the cloudless, windless, saffron sky.    A snake sleeps under a grease-wood plant;    A horned toad snaps at a passing ant;    The plain is void as a polar floe,    And the limitless sky has a furnace glow.    The men are gaunt and shaggy and gray,    And their childhood river is far away;    The gold still hides at the rainbow's tip,    Yet the wanderer speaks with a resolute lip.    "I will seek till I find--or till I die,"    He mutters, and lifts his clenched hand high,    And puts behind him love and wife,    And the quiet round of a farmer's life.3. _Pine_    The dark day ends in a bitter night.    The mighty mountains cold, and white,    And stern as avarice, still hide their gold    Deep in wild cañons fold on fold,    Both men are old, and one is grown    As gray as the snows around him sown.    He hovers over a fire of pine,    Spicy and cheering; toward the line    Of the towering peaks he lifts his eyes.    "I'd rather have a boy with shining hair,    To bear my name, than all your share    Of earth's red gold," he said;    And died, a loveless, childless man,    Before the morning light began.CHAPTER XVIIIAT LAST THE STIKEENAbout the middle of the afternoon of the fifty-eighth day we topped alow divide, and came in sight of the Stikeen River. Our heartsthrilled with pleasure as we looked far over the deep blue andpurple-green spread of valley, dim with mist, in which a littlesilver ribbon of water could be seen.After weeks of rain, as if to make amend for useless severity, thesun came out, a fresh westerly breeze sprang up, and the sky filledwith glowing clouds flooded with tender light. The bloom of fireweedalmost concealed the devastation of flame in the fallen firs, and thegrim forest seemed a royal road over which we could pass as over acarpet--winter seemed far away.But all this was delusion. Beneath us lay a thousand quagmires. Theforest was filled with impenetrable jungles and hidden streams,ridges sullen and silent were to be crossed, and the snow was closeat hand. Across this valley an eagle might sweep with joy, but thepack trains must crawl in mud and mire through long hours of torture.We spent but a moment here, and then with grim resolution called out,"Line up, boys, line up!" and struck down upon the last two days ofour long journey.On the following noon we topped another rise, and came unmistakablyin sight of the Stikeen River lying deep in its rocky cañon. We hadridden all the morning in a pelting rain, slashed by wet trees,plunging through bogs and sliding down ravines, and when we saw thevalley just before us we raised a cheer. It seemed we could hear thehotel bells ringing far below.But when we had tumbled down into the big cañon near the water'sedge, we found ourselves in scarcely better condition than before. Wewere trapped with no feed for our horses, and no way to cross theriver, which was roaring mad by reason of the heavy rains, a swiftand terrible flood, impossible to swim. Men were camped all along thebank, out of food like ourselves, and ragged and worn and weary. Theyhad formed a little street of camps. Borland, the leader of the bigmule train, was there, calm and efficient as ever. "The WilsonOutfit," "The Man from Chihuahua," "Throw-me-feet," and theManchester boys were also included in the group. "The Dutchman" camesliding down just behind us.After a scanty dinner of bacon grease and bread we turned our horsesout on the flat by the river, and joined the little village. Borlandsaid: "We've been here for a day and a half, tryin' to induce thatdamn ferryman to come over, and now we're waitin' for reënforcements.Let's try it again, numbers will bring 'em."Thereupon we marched out solemnly upon the bank (some ten or fifteenof us) and howled like a pack of wolves.For two hours we clamored, alternating the Ute war-whoop with theSwiss yodel. It was truly cacophonous, but it produced results.Minute figures came to the brow of the hill opposite, and looked atus like cautious cockroaches and then went away. At last two shadowybeetles crawled down the zigzag trail to the ferry-boat, and beganbailing her out. Ultimately three men, sweating, scared, andtremulous, swung a clumsy scow upon the sand at our feet. It was nochild's play to cross that stream. Together with one of "The LittleDutchmen," and a representation from "The Mule Outfit," I steppedinto the boat and it was swung off into the savage swirl of graywater. We failed of landing the first time. I did not wonder at theferryman's nervousness, as I felt the heave and rush of the whirlingsavage flood.At the "ratty" little town of Telegraph Creek we purchased beans atfifteen cents a pound, bacon at thirty-five cents, and flour at tencents, and laden with these necessaries hurried back to the hungryhordes on the opposite side of the river. That night "The LittleDutchman" did nothing but cook and eat to make up for lost time.Every face wore a smile.The next morning Burton and one or two other men from the outfitstook the horses back up the trail to find feed, while the rest of usremained in camp to be ready for the boats. Late in the afternoon weheard far down the river a steamer whistling for Telegraph Creek,and everybody began packing truck down to the river where the boatwas expected to land. Word was sent back over the trail to the boysherding the horses, and every man was in a tremor of apprehensionlest the herders should not hear the boat and bring the horses downin time to get off on it.It was punishing work packing our stuff down the sloppy path to theriver bank, but we buckled to it hard, and in the course of a coupleof hours had all snug and ready for embarkation.There was great excitement among the outfits, and every man washurrying and worrying to get away. It was known that charges would behigh, and each of us felt in his pocket to see how many dollars hehad left. The steamboat company had us between fire and water andcould charge whatever it pleased. Some of the poor prospectors gaveup their last dollar to cross this river toward which they hadjourneyed so long.The boys came sliding down the trail wildly excited, driving thehorses before them, and by 5.30 we were all packed on the boat, onehundred and twenty horses and some two dozen men. We were a seedy andcareworn lot, in vivid contrast with the smartly uniformed purser ofthe boat. The rates were exorbitant, but there was nothing to do butto pay them. However, Borland and I, acting as committee, broughtsuch pressure to bear upon the purser that he "threw in" a dinner,and there was a joyous rush for the table when this good news wasannounced. For the first time in nearly three months we were able tosit down to a fairly good meal with clean nice tableware, with pieand pudding to end the meal. It seemed as though we had reachedcivilization. The boat was handsomely built, and quite new andcapacious, too, for it held our horses without serious crowding. Iwas especially anxious about Ladrone, but was able to get him into avery nice place away from the engines and in no danger of beingkicked by a vicious mule.We drifted down the river past Telegraph Creek without stopping, andlate at night laid by at Glenora and unloaded in the crisp, cooldusk. As we came off the boat with our horses we were met by a crowdof cynical loafers who called to us out of the dark, "What in hellyou fellows think you're doing?" We were regarded as wildly insanefor having come over so long and tedious a route.We erected our tents, and went into camp beside our horses on thebank near the dock. It was too late to move farther that night. Wefed our beasts upon hay at five cents a pound,--poor hay atthat,--and they were forced to stand exposed to the searching riverwind.As for ourselves, we were filled with dismay by the hopeless dulnessof the town. Instead of being the hustling, rushing gold camp we hadexpected to find, it came to light as a little town of tents andshanties, filled with men who had practically given up the TeslinLake Route as a bad job. The government trail was incomplete, thewagon road only built halfway, and the railroad--of which we hadheard so much talk--had been abandoned altogether.As I slipped the saddle and bridle from Ladrone next day and turnedhim out upon the river bottom for a two weeks' rest, my heart wasvery light. The long trail was over. No more mud, rocks, stumps, androots for Ladrone. Away the other poor animals streamed down thetrail, many of them lame, all of them poor and weak, and some of themstill crazed by the poisonous plants of the cold green mountainsthrough which they had passed.This ended the worst of the toil, the torment of the trail. It had nodangers, but it abounded in worriments and disappointments. As I lookback upon it now I suffer, because I see my horses standingankle-deep in water on barren marshes or crowding round the firechilled and weak, in endless rain. If our faces looked haggard andworn, it was because of the never ending anxiety concerning thefaithful animals who trusted in us to find them food and shelter.Otherwise we suffered little, slept perfectly dry and warm everynight, and ate three meals each day: true, the meals grew scanty andmonotonous, but we did not go hungry.The trail was a disappointment to me, not because it was long andcrossed mountains, but because it ran through a barren, monotonous,silent, gloomy, and rainy country. It ceased to interest me. It hadalmost no wild animal life, which I love to hear and see. Its lakesand rivers were for the most part cold and sullen, and its forestssombre and depressing. The only pleasant places after leavingHazleton were the high valleys above timber line. They weremagnificent, although wet and marshy to traverse.As a route to reach the gold fields of Teslin Lake and the Yukon itis absurd and foolish. It will never be used again for that purpose.Should mines develop on the high divides between the Skeena, Iskoot,and Stikeen, it may possibly be used again from Hazleton; otherwiseit will be given back to the Indians and their dogs.THE FOOTSTEP IN THE DESERT    A man put love forth from his heart,      And rode across the desert far away.    "Woman shall have no place nor part      In my lone life," men heard him say.    He rode right on. The level rim      Of the barren plain grew low and wide;    It seemed to taunt and beckon him,      To ride right on and fiercely ride.    One day he rode a well-worn path,      And lo! even in that far land    He saw (and cursed in gusty wrath)      A woman's footprint in the sand.    Sharply he drew the swinging rein,      And hanging from his saddle bow    Gazed long and silently--cursed again,      Then turned as if to go.    "For love will seize you at the end,      Fear loneliness--fear sickness, too,    For they will teach you wisdom, friend."      Yet he rode on as madmen do.    He built a cabin by a sounding stream,      He digged in cañons dark and deep,    And ever the waters caused a dream      And the face of woman broke his sleep.    It was a slender little mark,      And the man had lived alone so long    Within the cañon's noise and dark,      The footprint moved him like a song.    It spoke to him of women in the East,      Of girls in silken robes, with shining hair,    And talked of those who sat at feast,      While sweet-eyed laughter filled the air.    And more. A hundred visions rose,      He saw his mother's knotted hands    Ply round thick-knitted homely hose,      Her thoughts with him in desert lands.    A smiling wife, in bib and cap,      Moved busily from chair to chair,    Or sat with apples in her lap,      Content with sweet domestic care.    _All these his curse had put away,_      _All these were his no more to hold;_    _He had his cañon cold and gray,_      _He had his little heaps of gold._CHAPTER XIXTHE GOLDSEEKERS' CAMP AT GLENORAGlenora, like Telegraph Creek, was a village of tents and shacks.Previous to the opening of the year it had been an old Hudson Baytrading-post at the head of navigation on the Stikeen River, butduring April and May it had been turned into a swarming camp ofgoldseekers on their way to Teslin Lake by way of the much-advertised"Stikeen Route" to the Yukon.A couple of months before our arrival nearly five thousand people hadbeen encamped on the river flat; but one disappointment had followedanother, the government road had been abandoned, the pack trail hadproved a menace, and as a result the camp had thinned away, and whenwe of the Long Trail began to drop into town Glenora contained lessthan five hundred people, including tradesmen and mechanics.The journey of those who accompanied me on the Long Trail was by nomeans ended. It was indeed only half done. There remained more thanone hundred and seventy miles of pack trail before the head ofnavigation on the Yukon could be reached. I turned aside. My partnerwent on.In order to enter the head-waters of the Pelly it was necessary totraverse four hundred miles of trail, over which a year's provisionfor each man must be carried. Food was reported to be "a dollar apound" at Teslin Lake and winter was coming on. To set face towardany of these regions meant the most careful preparation or certaindeath.The weather was cold and bleak, and each night the boys assembledaround the big campfire to discuss the situation. They reported thecountry full of people eager to get away. Everybody seemed studyingthe problem of what to do and how to do it. Some were for going tothe head-waters of the Pelly, others advocated the Nisutlin, andothers still thought it a good plan to prospect on the head-waters ofthe Tooya, from which excellent reports were coming in.Hour after hour they debated, argued, and agreed. In the midst of itall Burton remained cool and unhurried. Sitting in our tent, whichflapped and quivered in the sounding southern wind, we discussed thequestion of future action. I determined to leave him here with fourof the horses and a thousand pounds of grub with which to enter thegold country; for my partner was a miner, not a literary man.It had been my intention to go with him to Teslin Lake, there tobuild a boat and float down the river to Dawson; but I was six weeksbehind my schedule, the trail was reported to be bad, and the waterin the Hotalinqua very low, making boating slow and hazardous.Therefore I concluded to join the stream of goldseekers who werepushing down toward the coast to go in by way of Skagway.There was a feeling in the air on the third day after going into campwhich suggested the coming of autumn. Some of the boys began to dreadthe desolate north, out of which the snows would soon begin to sweep.It took courage to set face into that wild land with winter comingon, and yet many of them were ready to do it. The Manchester boys andBurton formed a "side-partnership," and faced a year of bacon andbeans without visible sign of dismay.The ominous cold deepened a little every night. It seemed likeOctober as the sun went down. Around us on every side the mountainpeaks cut the sky keen as the edge of a sword, and the wind howled upthe river gusty and wild.A little group of tents sprang up around our own and every day wasfull of quiet enjoyment. We were all living very high, with plenty ofberries and an occasional piece of fresh beef. Steel-head salmon wererunning and were a drug in the market.The talk of the Pelly River grew excited as a report came indetailing a strike, and all sorts of outfits began to sift out alongthe trail toward Teslin Lake. The rain ceased at last and the daysgrew very pleasant with the wind again in the south, roaring up theriver all day long with great power, reminding me of the equatorialcurrents which sweep over Illinois and Wisconsin in September. We hadnothing now to trouble us but the question of moving out into thegold country.One by one the other misguided ones of the Long Trail came droppinginto camp to meet the general depression and stagnation. They werebrown, ragged, long-haired, and for the most part silent with dismay.Some of them celebrated their escape by getting drunk, but mainlythey were too serious-minded to waste time or substance. Some of themhad expended their last dollar on the trail and were forced to selltheir horses for money to take them out of the country. Some of thepartnerships went to pieces for other causes. Long-smoulderingdissensions burst into flame. "The Swedes" divided and so did "TheDutchman," the more resolute of them keeping on the main trail whileothers took the trail to the coast or returned to the States.Meanwhile, Ladrone and his fellows were rejoicing like ourselves infairly abundant food and in continuous rest. The old gray began tolook a little more like his own proud self. As I went out to see himhe came up to me to be curried and nosed about me, begging for salt.His trust in me made him doubly dear, and I took great joy inthinking that he, at least, was not doomed to freeze or starve inthis savage country which has no mercy and no hope for horses.There was great excitement on the first Sunday following our goinginto camp, when the whistle of a steamer announced the coming of themail. It produced as much movement as an election or a bear fight. Weall ran to the bank to see her struggle with the current, gainingheadway only inch by inch. She was a small stern-wheeler, not unlikethe boats which run on the upper Missouri. We all followed her downto the Hudson Bay post, like a lot of small boys at a circus, to seeher unload. This was excitement enough for one day, and we returnedto camp feeling that we were once more in touch with civilization.Among the first of those who met us on our arrival was a German, whowas watching some horses and some supplies in a big tent close by theriver bank. While pitching my tent on that first day he came over tosee me, and after a few words of greeting said quietly, but withfeeling, "I am glad you've come, it was so lonesome here." We werevery busy, but I think we were reasonably kind to him in the daysthat followed. He often came over of an evening and stood about thefire, and although I did not seek to entertain him, I am glad to sayI answered him civilly; Burton was even social.I recall these things with a certain degree of feeling, because notless than a week later this poor fellow was discovered by one of ourcompany swinging from the crosstree of the tent, a ghastly corpse.There was something inexplicable in the deed. No one could accountfor it. He seemed not to be a man of deep feeling. And one of thelast things he uttered in my hearing was a coarse jest which I didnot like and to which I made no reply.In his pocket the coroner found a letter wherein he had written,"Bury me right here where I failed, here on the bank of the river."It contained also a message to his wife and children in the States.There were tragic splashes of red on the trail, murder, and violentdeath by animals and by swift waters. Now here at the end of thetrail was a suicide.    So this is the end of the trail to him--    To swing at the tail of a rope and die;    Making a chapter gray and grim,    Adding a ghost to the midnight sky?    He toiled for days on the icy way,    He slept at night on the wind-swept snow;    Now here he hangs in the morning's gray,    A grisly shape by the river's flow.It was just two weeks later when I put the bridle and saddle onLadrone and rode him down the trail. His heart was light as mine, andhe had gained some part of his firm, proud, leaping walk. He hadconfidence in the earth once more. This was the first firm stretch ofroad he had trod for many weeks. He was now to take the boat for theoutside world.There was an element of sadness in the parting between Ladrone andthe train he had led for so many miles. As we saddled up for the lasttime he stood waiting. The horses had fared together for ninety days.They had "lined up" nearly two hundred times, and now for the lasttime I called out: "Line up, boys! Line up! Heke! Heke!"Ladrone swung into the trail. Behind him came "Barney," next "Major,"then sturdy "Bay Bill," and lastly "Nibbles," the pony. For the lasttime they were to follow their swift gray leader, who was goingsouth to live at ease, while they must begin again the ascent of thetrail.Ladrone whinnied piteously for his mates as I led him aboard thesteamer, but they did not answer. They were patiently waiting theirmaster's signal. Never again would they set eyes on the stately grayleader who was bound to most adventurous things. Never again wouldthey see the green grass come on the hills.I had a feeling that I could go on living this way, leading a packtrain across the country indefinitely. It seemed somehow as thoughthis way of life, this routine, must continue. I had a deep interestin the four horses, and it was not without a feeling of guilt that Isaw them move away on their last trail. At bottom the end of everyhorse is tragic. Death comes sooner or later, but death here in thiscountry, so cold and bleak and pitiless to all animals, seems somehowcloser, more inevitable, more cruel, and flings over every animal theshadow of immediate tragedy. There was something approaching crime inbringing a horse over that trail for a thousand miles only to turnhim loose at the end, or to sell him to some man who would work himto the point of death, and then shoot him or turn him out to freeze.As the time came when I must return to the south and to the tame, thesettled, the quiet, I experienced a profound feeling of regret, oflonging for the wild and lonely. I looked up at the shining green andwhite mountains and they allured me still, notwithstanding all thetoil and discomfort of the journey just completed. The wind from thesouth, damp and cool, the great river gliding with rushing roar tomeet the sea, had a distinct and wonderful charm from which I rentmyself with distinct effort.THE TOIL OF THE TRAIL    What have I gained by the toil of the trail?    I know and know well.    I have found once again the lore I had lost    In the loud city's hell.    I have broadened my hand to the cinch and the axe,    I have laid my flesh to the rain;    I was hunter and trailer and guide;    I have touched the most primitive wildness again.    I have threaded the wild with the stealth of the deer,    No eagle is freer than I;    No mountain can thwart me, no torrent appall,    I defy the stern sky.    So long as I live these joys will remain,    I have touched the most primitive wildness again.CHAPTER XXGREAT NEWS AT WRANGELLBoat after boat had come up, stopped for a night, and dropped downthe river again, carrying from ten to twenty of the goldseekers whohad determined to quit or to try some other way in; and at last thetime had come for me to say good-by to Burton and all those who haddetermined to keep on to Teslin Lake. I had helped them buy and sackand weigh their supplies, and they were ready to line up once more.As I led Ladrone down toward the boat, he called again for hisfellows, but only strangers made reply. After stowing him safely awayand giving him feed, I returned to the deck in order to wave my hatto Burton.In accordance with his peculiar, undemonstrative temperament, hestood for a few moments in silence, with his hands folded behind hisback, then, with a final wave of the hand, turned on his heel andreturned to his work.Farewells and advice more or less jocular rang across the rail of theboat between some ten or fifteen of us who had hit the new trail andthose on shore."Good-by, boys; see you at Dawson.""We'll beat you in yet," called Bill. "Don't over-work.""Let us know if you strike it!" shouted Frank."All right; you do the same," I replied.As the boat swung out into the stream, and the little group on thebank faded swiftly away, I confess to a little dimness of the eyes. Ithought of the hardships toward which my uncomplaining partner washeaded, and it seemed to me Nature was conspiring to crush him.The trip down the river was exceedingly interesting. The stream grewnarrower as we approached the coast range, and became at last verydangerous for a heavy boat such as the _Strathcona_ was. We wereforced to lay by at last, some fifty miles down, on account of theterrific wind which roared in through the gap, making the steering ofthe big boat through the cañon very difficult.At the point where we lay for the night a small creek came in.Steel-headed salmon were running, and the creek was literally linedwith bear tracks of great size, as far up as we penetrated. Thesebears are said to be a sort of brown fishing bear of enormous bulk,as large as polar bears, and when the salmon are spawning in theupper waters of the coast rivers, they become so fat they can hardlymove. Certainly I have never been in a country where bear signs wereso plentiful. The wood was an almost impassable tangle of vines andundergrowth, and the thought of really finding a bear was appalling.The Stikeen breaks directly through the coast range at right angles,like a battering-ram. Immense glaciers were on either side. Onetremendous river of ice came down on our right, presenting a facewall apparently hundreds of feet in height and some miles in width. Ishould have enjoyed exploring this glacier, which is said to be oneof the greatest on the coast.The next day our captain, a bold and reckless man, carried us throughto Wrangell by _walking_ his boat over the sand bars on itspaddle-wheel. I was exceedingly nervous, because if for any reason wehad become stuck in mid river, it would have been impossible to feedLadrone or to take him ashore except by means of another steamer.However, all things worked together to bring us safely through, andin the afternoon of the second day we entered an utterly differentworld--the warm, wet coast country. The air was moist, the grassesand tall ferns were luxuriant, and the forest trees immense. Out intoa sun-bright bay we swept with a feeling of being in safe waters oncemore, and rounded-to about sunset at a point on the island just abovea frowzy little town. This was Wrangell Island and the town was FortWrangell, one of the oldest stations on the coast.I had placed my horse under bond intending to send him through toVancouver to be taken care of by the Hudson Bay Company. He was stilla Canadian horse and so must remain upon the wharf over night. As hewas very restless and uneasy, I camped down beside him on theplanks.I lay for a long time listening to the waters flowing under me andlooking at the gray-blue sky, across which stars shot like distantrockets dying out in the deeps of the heavens in silence. An odioussmell rose from the bay as the tide went out, a seal bawled in thedistance, fishes flopped about in the pools beneath me, and a manplaying a violin somewhere in the village added a melancholy note. Icould hear the boys crying, "All about the war," and Ladronecontinued restless and eager. Several times in the night, when hewoke me with his trampling, I called to him, and hearing my voice hebecame quiet.I took breakfast at a twenty-five cent "joint," where I washed out ofa tin basin in an ill-smelling area. After breakfast I grappled withthe customs man and secured the papers which made Ladrone an Americanhorse, free to eat grass wherever it could be found under the starsand stripes. I started immediately to lead him to pasture, and thiswas an interesting and memorable experience.There are no streets, that is to say no roads, in Wrangell. There areno carriages and no horses, not even donkeys. Therefore it wasnecessary for Ladrone to walk the perilous wooden sidewalks after me.This he did with all the dignity of a county judge, and at last wecame upon grass, knee deep, rich and juicy.Our passage through the street created a great sensation. Littlechildren ran to the gates to look upon us. "There goes a horsie,"they shouted. An old man stopped me on the street and asked me whereI was taking "T'old 'orse." I told him I had already ridden him overa thousand miles and now he was travelling with me back to God'scountry. He looked at me in amazement, and walked off tapping hisforehead as a sign that I must certainly "have wheels."As I watched Ladrone at his feed an old Indian woman came along andsmiled with amiable interest. At last she said, pointing to the otherside of the village, "Over there muck-a-muck, hy-u muck-a-muck." Shewished to see the horse eating the best grass there was to be had onthe island.A little later three or four native children came down the hill andwere so amazed and so alarmed at the sight of this great beastfeeding beside the walk that they burst into loud outcry and randesperately away. They were not accustomed to horses. To them he wasquite as savage in appearance as a polar bear.In a short time everybody in the town knew of the old gray horse andhis owner. I furnished a splendid topic for humorous conversationduring the dull hours of the day.Here again I came upon other gaunt and rusty-coated men from the LongTrail. They could be recognized at a glance by reason of their sombrefaces and their undecided action. They could scarcely bringthemselves to such ignominious return from a fruitless trip on whichthey had started with so much elation, and yet they hesitated aboutattempting any further adventure to the north, mainly because theirhorses had sold for so little and their expenses had been so great.Many of them were nearly broken. In the days that followed theydiscussed the matter in subdued voices, sitting in the sun on thegreat wharf, sombrely looking out upon the bay.On the third day a steamer came in from the north, buzzing with thenews of another great strike not far from Skagway. Juneau, Dyea, aswell as Skagway itself, were said to be almost deserted. Men wereleaving the White Pass Railway in hundreds, and a number of the handson the steamer herself had deserted under the excitement. Minglingwith the passengers we eagerly extracted every drop of informationpossible. No one knew much about it, but they said all they knew anda good part of what they had heard, and when the boat swung round anddisappeared in the moonlight, she left the goldseekers exultant andtremulous on the wharf.They were now aflame with desire to take part in this new stampede,which seemed to be within their slender means, and I, being one ofthem and eager to see such a "stampede," took a final session withthe customs collector, and prepared to board the next boat.I arranged with Duncan McKinnon to have my old horse taken care of inhis lot. I dug wells for him so that he should not lack for water,and treated him to a dish of salt, and just at sunset said good-by tohim with another twinge of sadness and turned toward the wharf. Helooked very lonely and sad standing there with drooping head in themidst of the stumps of his pasture lot. However, there was plenty offeed and half a dozen men volunteered to keep an eye on him."Don't worry, mon," said Donald McLane. "He'll be gettin' fat andstrong on the juicy grass, whilst you're a-heavin' out thegold-dust."There were about ten of us who lined up to the purser's window of thelittle steamer which came along that night and purchased second-classpassage. The boat was very properly named the _Utopia_, and was socrowded with other goldseekers from down the coast, that we of theLong Trail were forced to put our beds on the floor of the littlesaloon in the stern of the boat which was called the "social room."We were all second-class, and we all lay down in rows on the carpet,covering every foot of space. Each man rolled up in his own blankets,and I was the object of considerable remark by reason of my mattress,which gave me as good a bed as the vessel afforded.There was a great deal of noise on the boat, and its passengers, bothmen and women, were not of the highest type. There were severalstowaways, and some of the women were not very nice as to theiractions, and, rightly or wrongly, were treated with scant respect bythe men, who were loud and vulgar for the most part. Sleep wasdifficult in the turmoil.Though second-class passengers, strange to say, we came first attable and were very well fed. The boat ran entirely inside a long rowof islands, and the water was smooth as a river. The mountains greweach moment more splendid as we neared Skagway, and the ride was mostenjoyable. Whales and sharks interested us on the way. The women cameto light next day, and on the whole were much better than I hadinferred from the two or three who were the source of disturbance thenight before. The men were not of much interest; they seemed pettyand without character for the most part.At Juneau we came into a still more mountainous country, and for therest of the way the scenery was magnificent. Vast rivers of ice camecurving down absolutely out of the clouds which hid the summits ofthe mountains--came curving in splendid lines down to the verywater's edge. The sea was chill and gray, and as we entered the mouthof Lynn Canal a raw swift wind swept by, making us shiver with cold.The grim bronze-green mountains' sides formed a most impressive butforbidding scene.It was nine o'clock the next morning as we swung to and unloadedourselves upon one of the long wharves which run out from the town ofSkagway toward the deep water. We found the town exceedingly quiet.Half the men had gone to the new strike. Stores were being tended bywomen, some small shops were closed entirely, and nearly everybusiness firm had sent representatives into the new gold fields,which we now found to be on Atlin Lake.It was difficult to believe that this wharf a few months before hadbeen the scene of a bloody tragedy which involved the shooting of"Soapy Smith," the renowned robber and desperado. On the contrary, itseemed quite like any other town of its size in the States. The airwas warm and delightful in midday, but toward night the piercingwind swept down from the high mountains, making an overcoatnecessary.A few men had returned from this new district, and were full ofenthusiasm concerning the prospects. Their reports increased thealmost universal desire to have a part in the stampede. The Iowa boysfrom the Long Trail wasted no time, but set about their own plans forgetting in. They expected to reach the creek by sheer force andawkwardness.They had determined to try the "cut-off," which left the wagon roadand took off up the east fork of the Skagway River. Nearly threehundred people had already set out on this trail, and the boys feltsure of "making it all right--all right," though it led over a greatglacier and into an unmapped region of swift streams. "After theTelegraph Trail," said Doc, "we're not easily scared."It seemed to me a desperate chance, and I was not ready to enter uponsuch a trip with only such grub and clothing as could be carried uponmy back; but it was the last throw of the dice for these youngfellows. They had very little money left, and could not afford tohire pack trains; but by making a swift dash into the country, eachhoped to get a claim. How they expected to hold it or use it afterthey got it, they were unable to say; but as they were out for gold,and here was a chance (even though it were but the slightest chancein the world) to secure a location, they accepted it with the sublimeaudacity of youth and ignorance. They saddled themselves with theirpacks, and with a cheery wave of the hand said "Good-by and goodluck" and marched away in single file.Just a week later I went round to see if any news of them hadreturned to their bunk house. I found their names on the register.They had failed. One of them set forth their condition of purse andmind by writing: "Dave Walters, Boone, Iowa. Busted and going home."THE GOLDSEEKERS    I saw these dreamers of dreams go by,    I trod in their footsteps a space;    Each marched with his eyes on the sky,    Each passed with a light on his face.    They came from the hopeless and sad,    They faced the future and gold;    Some the tooth of want's wolf had made mad,    And some at the forge had grown old.    Behind them these serfs of the tool    The rags of their service had flung;    No longer of fortune the fool,    This word from each bearded lip rung:    "Once more I'm a man, I am free!    No man is my master, I say;    To-morrow I fail, it may be--    No matter, I'm freeman to-day."    They go to a toil that is sure,    To despair and hunger and cold;    Their sickness no warning can cure,    They are mad with a longing for gold.    The light will fade from each eye,    The smile from each face;    They will curse the impassible sky,    And the earth when the snow torrents race.    Some will sink by the way and be laid    In the frost of the desolate earth;    And some will return to a maid,    Empty of hand as at birth.    _But this out of all will remain,_    _They have lived and have tossed;_    _So much in the game will be gain,_    _Though the gold of the dice has been lost._CHAPTER XXITHE RUSH TO ATLIN LAKEIt took me longer to get under way, for I had determined to take atleast thirty days' provisions for myself and a newspaper man whojoined me here. Our supplies, together with tent, tools, andclothing, made a considerable outfit. However, in a few days we wereready to move, and when I again took my place at the head of a littlepack train it seemed quite in the natural order of things.We left late in the day with intent to camp at the little village ofWhite Pass, which was the end of the wagon road and some twelve milesaway. We moved out of town along a road lined with refuse,camp-bottoms, ruined cabins, tin cans, and broken bottles,--all theunsightly debris of the rush of May and June. A part of the way hadbeen corduroyed, for which I was exceedingly grateful, for theSkagway River roared savagely under our feet, while on either side ofthe roadway at other points I could see abysses of mud which, in thegrowing darkness, were sufficiently menacing.Our course was a northerly one. We were ascending the ever narrowingcañon of the river at a gentle grade, with snowy mountains in vista.We arrived at White Pass at about ten o'clock at night. A littletown is springing up there, confident of being an important stationon the railroad which was already built to that point.Thus far the journey had been easy and simple, but immediately afterleaving White Pass we entered upon an exceedingly stony road, filledwith sharp rock which had been blasted from the railway above us.Upon reaching the end of the wagon road, and entering upon the trail,we came upon the Way of Death. The waters reeked with carrion. Thebreeze was the breath of carrion, and all nature was made indecentand disgusting by the presence of carcasses. Within the distance offifteen miles we passed more than two thousand dead horses. It was acruel land, a land filled with the record of men's merciless greed.Nature herself was cold, majestic, and grand. The trail rough, hard,and rocky. The horses labored hard under their heavy burdens, thoughthe floor they trod was always firm.Just at the summit in the gray mist, where a bulbous granite ridgecut blackly and lonesomely against the sky, we overtook a flock ofturkeys being driven by a one-armed man with a singularly appropriateScotch cap on his head. The birds sat on the bleak gray rocks in thegathering dusk with the suggestion of being utterly at the end of theworld. Their feathers were blown awry by the merciless wind and theylooked weary, disconsolate, and bewildered. Their faint, sad gobblingwas like the talk of sick people lost in a desert. They were on theirway to Dawson City to their death and they seemed to know it.We camped at the Halfway House, a big tent surrounded by the mostdiabolical landscape of high peaks lost in mist, with near-by slopesof gray rocks scantily covered with yellow-green grass. All was bare,wild, desolate, and drear. The wind continued to whirl down over thedivide, carrying torn gray masses of vapor which cast a gloomy halflight across the gruesome little meadow covered with rottingcarcasses and crates of bones which filled the air with odor ofdisease and death.Within the tent, which flopped and creaked in the wind, we huddledabout the cook-stove in the light of a lantern, listening to the loudtalk of a couple of packers who were discussing their business withenormous enthusiasm. Happily they grew sleepy at last and peacesettled upon us. I unrolled my sleeping bag and slept dreamlesslyuntil the "Russian nobleman," who did the cooking, waked me.Morning broke bleak and desolate. Mysterious clouds which hid thepeaks were still streaming wildly down the cañon. We got away atlast, leaving behind us that sad little meadow and its gruesomelakes, and began the slow and toilsome descent over slippery ledgesof rock, among endless rows of rotting carcasses, over poisonousstreams and through desolate, fire-marked, and ghastly forests ofsmall pines. Everywhere were the traces of the furious flood ofhumankind that had broken over this height in the early spring.Wreckage of sleighs, abandoned tackle, heaps of camp refuse,clothing, and most eloquent of all the pathway itself, worn into thepitiless iron ledges, made it possible for me to realize something ofthe scene.Down there in the gully, on the sullen drift of snow, the wintertrail could still be seen like an unclean ribbon and here, where theshrivelled hides of horses lay thick, wound the summer pathway. Upyonder summit, lock-stepped like a file of convicts, with tonguesprotruding and breath roaring from their distended throats, thousandsof men had climbed with killing burdens on their backs, mad to reachthe great inland river and the gold belt. Like the men of the LongTrail, they, too, had no time to find the gold under their feet.It was terrible to see how on every slippery ledge the ranks ofhorses had broken like waves to fall in heaps like rows of seaweed,tumbled, contorted, and grinning. Their dried skins had taken on thecolor of the soil, so that I sometimes set foot upon them withoutrealizing what they were. Many of them had saddles on and nearly allhad lead-ropes. Some of them had even been tied to trees and left tostarve.In all this could be read the merciless greed and impracticability ofthese goldseekers. Men who had never driven a horse in their lives,and had no idea what an animal could do, or what he required to eat,loaded their outfits upon some poor patient beast and drove himwithout feed until, weakened and insecure of foot, he slipped andfell on some one of these cruel ledges of flinty rock.The business of packing, however, had at last fallen into less cruelor at least more judicial hands, and though the trail was filledwith long pack trains going and coming, they were for the most partwell taken care of. We met many long trains of packhorses returningempty from Bennett Lake. They were followed by shouting drivers whoclattered along on packhorses wherever the trail would permit.One train carried four immense trunks--just behind the trunks,mounted astride of one of the best horses, rode a bold-faced,handsome white woman followed by a huge negress. The white woman hadmade her pile by dancing a shameless dance in the dissolute dens ofDawson City, and was on her way to Paris or New York for a "goodtime." The reports of the hotel keepers made her out to beunspeakably vile. The negress was quite decent by contrast.At Log Cabin we came in sight of the British flag which marks theboundary line of United States territory, where a camp of mountedpolice and the British customs officer are located. It was a drearseason even in midsummer, a land of naked ledges and cold whitepeaks. A few small pine trees furnished logs for the cabins and woodfor their fires. The government offices were located in tents.I found the officers most courteous, and the customs fair. Thetreatment given me at Log Cabin was in marked contrast with theexactions of my own government at Wrangell. All goods were unloadedbefore the inspector's tent and quickly examined. The miner sufferedvery little delay.A number of badly maimed packhorses were running about on theAmerican side. I was told that the police had stopped them by reasonof their sore backs. If a man came to the line with horses overloadedor suffering, he was made to strip the saddles from their backs."You can't cross this line with animals like that," was the sternsentence in many cases. This humanity, as unexpected as it waspleasing, deserves the best word of praise of which I am capable.At last we left behind us all these wrecks of horseflesh, thesepoisonous streams, and came down upon Lake Bennett, where the waterwas considered safe to drink, and where the eye could see somethingbesides death-spotted ledges of savage rocks.The town was a double row of tents, and log huts set close to thebeach whereon boats were building and saws and hammers were utteringa cheerful chorus. Long trains of packhorses filled the streets. Thewharfs swarmed with men loading chickens, pigs, vegetables,furniture, boxes of dry-goods, stoves, and every other conceivabledomestic utensil into big square barges, which were rigged with tallstrong masts bearing most primitive sails. It was a busy scene, butof course very quiet as compared with the activity of May, June, andJuly.These barges appealed to me very strongly. They were in some casesfloating homes, a combination of mover's wagon and river boat. Manyof them contained women and children, with accompanying cats andcanary birds. In every face was a look of exultant faith in theventure. They were bound for Dawson City. The men for Atlin weresetting forth in rowboats, or were waiting for the little steamerswhich had begun to ply between Bennett City and the new gold fields.I set my little tent, which was about as big as a dog kennel, andcrawled into it early, in order to be shielded from the winds, whichgrew keen as sword blades as the sun sank behind the westernmountains. The sky was like November, and I wondered where Burton wasencamped. I would have given a great deal to have had him with me onthis trip.THE COAST RANGE OF ALASKA    The wind roars up from the angry sea    With a message of warning and haste to me.    It bids me go where the asters blow,    And the sun-flower waves in the sunset glow.    From the granite mountains the glaciers crawl,    In snow-white spray the waters fall.    The bay is white with the crested waves,    And ever the sea wind ramps and raves.    I hate this cold, bleak northern land,    I fear its snow-flecked harborless strand--    I fly to the south as a homing dove,    Back to the land of corn I love.    And never again shall I set my feet    Where the snow and the sea and the mountains meet.CHAPTER XXIIATLIN LAKE AND THE GOLD FIELDSThere is nothing drearier than camping on the edge of civilizationlike this, where one is surrounded by ill smells, invaded by streamsof foul dust, and deprived of wood and clear water. I was exceedinglyeager to get away, especially as the wind continued cold and verysearching. It was a long dull day of waiting.At last the boat came in and we trooped aboard--a queer mixture ofmen and bundles. The boat itself was a mere scow with an uprightengine in the centre and a stern-wheel tacked on the outside. Therewere no staterooms, of course, and almost no bunks. The interiorresembled a lumberman's shanty.We moved off towing a big scow laden with police supplies for TagishHouse. The wind was very high and pushed steadily behind, or we wouldnot have gone faster than a walk. We had some eight or tenpassengers, all bound for the new gold fields, and these togetherwith their baggage and tools filled the boat to the utmost corner.The feeling of elation among these men reminded me of the great landboom of Dakota in 1883, in which I took a part. There was somethingfine and free and primitive in it all.We cooked our supper on the boat's stove, furnishing our own foodfrom the supplies we were taking in with us. The ride promised to bevery fine. We made off down the narrow lake, which lies between twowalls of high bleak mountains, but far in the distance more alluringranges arose. There was no sign of mineral in the near-by peaks.Late in the afternoon the wind became so high and the captain of ourboat so timid, we were forced to lay by for the night and so swungaround under a point, seeking shelter from the wind, which becameeach moment more furious. I made my bed down on the roof of the boatand went to sleep looking at the drifting clouds overhead. Once ortwice during the night when I awoke I heard the howling blastsweeping by with increasing power.All the next day we loitered on Bennett Lake--the wind roaringwithout ceasing, and the white-caps running like hares. We drifted atlast into a cove and there lay in shelter till six o'clock at night.The sky was clear and the few clouds were gloriously bright and cooland fleecy.We met several canoes of goldseekers on their return who shouteddoleful warnings at us and cursed the worthlessness of the districtto which we were bound. They all looked exceedingly dirty, ragged,and sour of visage. At the same time, however, boat after boat wentsailing down past us on their way to Atlin and Dawson. They drovestraight before the wind, and for the most part experienced littledanger, all of which seemed to us to emphasize the unnecessarytimidity of our own captain.There was a charm in this wild spot, but we were too impatient toenjoy it. There were men on board who felt that they were beingcheated of a chance to get a gold mine, and when the wind began tofall we fired up and started down the lake. As deep night came on Imade my bed on the roof again and went to sleep with the flyingsparks lining the sky overhead. I was in some danger of being set onfire, but I preferred sleeping there to sleeping on the floor insidethe boat, where the reek of tobacco smoke was sickening.When I awoke we were driving straight up Tagish Lake, a beautiful,clear, green and blue spread of rippling water with lofty and boldlyoutlined peaks on each side. The lake ran from southeast to northwestand was much larger than any map shows. We drove steadily for tenhours up this magnificent water with ever increasing splendor ofscenery, arriving about sunset at Taku City, which we found to be alittle group of tents at the head of Taku arm.Innumerable boats of every design fringed the shore. Men were comingand men were going, producing a bewildering clash of opinions withrespect to the value of the mines. A few of these to whom we spokesaid, "It's all a fake," and others were equally certain it was "Allright."A short portage was necessary to reach Atlin Lake, and taking a partof our baggage upon our shoulders we hired the remainder packed onhorses and within an hour were moving up the smooth path under thesmall black pines, across the low ridge which separates the twolakes. At the top of this ridge we were able to look out over themagnificent spread of Atlin Lake, which was more beautiful in everyway than Tagish or Taku. It is, in fact, one of the most beautifullakes I have ever seen.Far to the southeast it spread until it was lost to view among thebases of the gigantic glacier-laden mountains of the coast range. Tothe left--that is to the north--it seemed to divide, enclosing asplendid dome-shaped solitary mountain, one fork moving to the east,the other to the west. Its end could not be determined by the eye ineither direction. Its width was approximately about ten miles.At the end of the trail we found an enterprising Canadian with anaphtha launch ready to ferry us across to Atlin City, but wereforced to wait for some one who had gone back to Taku for a secondload.While we were waiting, the engineer, who was a round-faced and rathergreen boy, fell under the influences of a large, plump, and verytalkative lady who made the portage just behind us. She so absorbedand fascinated the lad that he let the engine run itself into somecramp of piston or wheel. There was a sudden crunching sound and thepropeller stopped. The boy minimized the accident, but the captainupon arrival told us it would be necessary to unload from the boatwhile the engine was being repaired.It was now getting dark, and as it was pretty evident that therepairs on the boat would take a large part of the night, we campedwhere we were. The talkative lady, whom the irreverent called "theglass front," occupied a tent which belonged to the captain of thelaunch and the rest of us made our beds down under the big trees.A big fire was built and around this we sat, doing more or lesstalking. There was an old Tennesseean in the party from Dawson, whotalked interminably. He told us of his troubles, trials, andvictories in Dawson: how he had been successful, how he had fallenill, and how his life had been saved by a good old miner who gave himan opportunity to work over his dump. Sick as he was he was able in afew days to find gold enough to take him out of the country to adoctor. He was now on his way back to his claim and professed to bevery sceptical of Atlin and every other country except Dawson.The plump lady developed exceedingly kittenish manners late in theevening, and invited the whole company to share her tent. A singulartype of woman, capable of most ladylike manners and havingastonishingly sensible moments, but inexpressibly silly most of thetime. She was really a powerful, self-confident, and shrewd woman,but preferred to seem young and helpless. Altogether the company wassufficiently curious. There was a young civil engineer from New YorkCity, a land boomer from Skagway, an Irishman from Juneau, arepresentative of a New York paper, one or two nondescripts from theStates, and one or two prospectors from Quebec. The night was coldand beautiful and my partner and I, by going sufficiently far awayfrom the old Tennesseean and the plump lady, were able to sleepsoundly until sunrise.The next morning we hired a large unpainted skiff and by working veryhard ourselves in addition to paying full fare we reached camp atabout ten o'clock in the morning. Atlin City was also a clump oftents half hidden in the trees on the beach of the lake near themouth of Pine Creek. The lake was surpassingly beautiful under themorning sun.A crowd of sullen, profane, and grimy men were lounging around,cursing the commissioners and the police. The beach was fringed withrowboats and canoes, like a New England fishing village, and all daylong men were loading themselves into these boats, hungry, tired, andweary, hastening back to Skagway or the coast; while others, fresh,buoyant, and hopeful, came gliding in.To those who came, the sullen and disappointed ones who were about togo uttered approbrious cries: "See the damn fools come! What d'youthink you're doin'? On a fishin' excursion?"We went into camp on the water front, and hour after hour men ladenwith packs tramped ceaselessly to and fro along the pathway justbelow our door. I was now chief cook and bottle washer, my partner,who was entirely unaccustomed to work of this kind, having the statusof a boarder.The lake was a constant joy to us. As the sun sank the glacialmountains to the southwest became most royal in their robes of purpleand silver. The sky filled with crimson and saffron clouds which thelake reflected like a mirror. The little rocky islands drowsed in themist like some strange monsters sleeping on the bosom of the water.The men were filthy and profane for the most part, and made enjoymentof nature almost impossible. Many of them were of the rudest and mostuninteresting types, nomads--almost tramps. They had nothing of theepic qualities which belong to the mountaineers and natural miners ofthe Rocky Mountains. Many of them were loafers and ne'er-do-wellsfrom Skagway and other towns of the coast.We had a gold pan, a spade, and a pick. Therefore early the nextmorning we flung a little pack of grub over our shoulders and setforth to test the claims which were situated upon Pine Creek, astream which entered Lake Atlin near the camp. It was said to beeighteen miles long and Discovery claim was some eight miles up.We traced our way up the creek as far as Discovery and back, panningdirt at various places with resulting colors in some cases. The trailwas full of men racking to and fro with heavy loads on their backs.They moved in little trains of four or five or six men, some goingout of the country, others coming in--about an equal number each way.Everything along the creek was staked, and our test work resulted innothing more than gaining information with regard to what was goingon.The camps on the hills at night swarmed with men in hot debate. Themajority believed the camps to be a failure, and loud discussionsresounded from the trees as partner and I sat at supper. Thetown-site men were very nervous. The camps were decreasing inpopulation, and the tone was one of general foreboding.The campfires flamed all along the lake walk, and the talk of eachgroup could be overheard by any one who listened. Altercations wenton with clangorous fury. Almost every party was in division. Someenthusiastic individual had made a find, or had seen some one elsewho had. His cackle reached other groups, and out of the dark hulkingfigures loomed to listen or to throw in hot missiles of profanity.Phrases multiplied, mingling inextricably."Morgan claims thirty cents to the pan ... good creek claim ... hissluice is about ready ... a clean-up last night ... I don't believeit.... No, Sir, I wouldn't give a hundred dollars for the whole damnmoose pasture.... Well, it's good enough for me.... I tell you it'srotten, the whole damn cheese.... You've got to stand in with thepolice or you can't get...." and so on and on unendingly, withoutcoherence. I went to sleep only when the sound of the wordy warfaredied away.I permitted myself a day of rest. Borrowing a boat next day, we wentout upon the water and up to the mouth of Pine Creek, where we pannedsome dirt to amuse ourselves. The lake was like liquid glass, thebottom visible at an enormous depth. It made me think of themarvellous water of McDonald Lake in the Kalispels. I steered theboat (with a long-handled spade) and so was able to look about me andabsorb at ease the wonderful beauty of this unbroken and unhewnwilderness. The clouds were resplendent, and in every direction thelake vistas were ideally beautiful and constantly changing.Toward night the sky grew thick and heavy with clouds. The water ofthe lake was like molten jewels, ruby and amethyst. The boat seemedfloating in some strange, ethereal substance hitherto unknown toman--translucent and iridescent. The mountains loomed like dim purplepillars at the western gate of the world, and the rays of thehalf-hidden sun plunging athwart these sentinels sank deep into theshining flood. Later the sky cleared, and the inverted mountains inthe lake were scarcely less vivid than those which rose into the sky.The next day I spent with gold pan and camera, working my way upSpruce Creek, a branch of Pine. I found men cheerily at work gettingout sluice boxes and digging ditches. I panned everywhere, but didnot get much in the way of colors, but the creek seemed to growbetter as I went up, and promised very rich returns. I came backrushing, making five miles just inside an hour, hungry and tired.The crowded camp thinned out. The faint-hearted ones who had nocourage to sweat for gold sailed away. Others went out upon theirclaims to build cabins and lay sluices. I found them whip-sawinglumber, building cabins, and digging ditches. Each day the news grewmore encouraging, each day brought the discovery of a new creek or alake. Men came back in swarms and reporting finds on "Lake Surprise,"a newly discovered big body of water, and at last came the report ofsurprising discoveries in the benches high above the creek.In the camp one night I heard a couple of men talking around acampfire near me. One of them said: "Why, you know old Sperry wasdigging on the ridge just above Discovery and I came along and seehim up there. And I said, 'Hullo, uncle, what you doin', diggin' yourgrave?' And the old feller said, 'You just wait a few minutes andI'll show ye.' Well, sir, he filled up a sack o' dirt and toted itdown to the creek, and I went along with him to see him wash it out,and say, he took $3.25 out of one pan of that dirt, and $1.85 out ofthe other pan. Well, that knocked me. I says, 'Uncle, you're allright.' And then I made tracks for a bench claim next him. Well,about that time everybody began to hustle for bench claims, and nowyou can't get one anywhere near him."At another camp, a packer was telling of an immense nugget that hadbeen discovered somewhere on the upper waters of Birch Creek. "Andsay, fellers, you know there is another lake up there pretty near asbig as Atlin. They are calling it Lake Surprise. I heard a feller saya few days ago there was a big lake up there and I thought he meant alake six or eight miles long. On the very high ground next to Birch,you can look down over that lake and I bet it's sixty miles long. Itmust reach nearly to Teslin Lake." There was something pretty fine inthe thought of being in a country where lakes sixty miles long werebeing discovered and set forth on the maps of the world. Up to thistime Atlin Lake itself was unmapped. To an unpractical man likemyself it was reward enough to feel the thrill of excitement whichcomes with such discoveries.However, I was not a goldseeker, and when I determined to give up anyfurther pursuit of mining and to delegate it entirely to my partner,I experienced a feeling of relief. I determined to "stick to mylast," notwithstanding the fascination which I felt in the sight ofplacer gold. Quartz mining has never had the slightest attraction forme, but to see the gold washed out of the sand, to see it appearbright and shining in the black sand in the bottom of the pan, isreally worth while. It is first-hand contact with Nature's stores ofwealth.I went up to Discovery for the last time with my camera slung over myshoulder, and my note-book in hand to take a final survey of theminers and to hear for the last time their exultant talk. I foundthem exceedingly cheerful, even buoyant.The men who had gone in with ten days' provisions, the tenderfootminers, the men "with a cigarette and a sandwich," had gone out.Those who remained were men who knew their business and were resoluteand self-sustaining.There was a crowd of such men around the land-office tents and manyfilings were made. Nearly every man had his little phial of gold toshow. No one was loud, but every one seemed to be quietly confidentand replied to my questions in a low voice, "Well, you can safely saythe country is all right."The day was fine like September in Wisconsin. The lake as I walkedback to it was very alluring. My mind returned again and again tothe things I had left behind for so long. My correspondence, mybooks, my friends, all the literary interests of my life, began toreassert their dominion over me. For some time I had realized thatthis was almost an ideal spot for camping or mining. Just over in thewild country toward Teslin Lake, herds of caribou were grazing. Mooseand bear were being killed daily, rich and unknown streams werewaiting for the gold pan, the pick and the shovel, but--it was notfor me! I was ready to return--eager to return.THE FREEMAN OF THE HILLS    I have no master but the wind,      My only liege the sun;      All bonds and ties I leave behind,    Free as the wolf I run.    My master wind is passionless,      He neither chides nor charms;    He fans me or he freezes me,      And helps are quick as harms.    He never turns to injure me,      And when his voice is high    I crouch behind a rock and see      His storm of snows go by.    He too is subject of the sun,      As all things earthly are,    Where'er he flies, where'er I run,      We know our kingly star.THE VOICE OF THE MAPLE TREE    I am worn with the dull-green spires of fir,    I am tired of endless talk of gold,    I long for the cricket's cheery whirr,    And the song that the maples sang of old.    O the beauty and learning and light    That lie in the leaves of the level lands!    They shake my heart in the deep of the night,    They call me and bless me with calm, cool hands.      _Sing, O leaves of the maple tree,_      _I hear your voice by the savage sea,_      _Hear and hasten to home and thee!_CHAPTER XXIIITHE END OF THE TRAILThe day on which I crossed the lake to Taku City was most glorious. ASeptember haze lay on the mountains, whose high slopes, orange, ruby,and golden-green, allured with almost irresistible attraction.Although the clouds were gathering in the east, the sunset wassuperb. Taku arm seemed a river of gold sweeping between gates ofpurple. As the darkness came on, a long creeping line of fire creptup a near-by mountain's side, and from time to time, as it reachedsome great pine, it flamed to the clouds like a mighty geyser ofred-hot lava. It was splendid but terrible to witness.The next day was a long, long wait for the steamer. I now had in mypocket just twelve dollars, but possessed a return ticket on one ofthe boats. This ticket was not good on any other boat, and naturallyI felt considerable anxiety for fear it would not turn up. My dinnerconsisted of moose steak, potatoes, and bread, and was mostthoroughly enjoyed.At last the steamer came, but it was not the one on which I hadsecured passage, and as it took almost my last dollar to pay for deckpassage thereon, I lived on some small cakes of my own baking, whichI carried in a bag. I was now in a sad predicament unless I shouldconnect at Lake Bennett with some one who would carry my outfit backto Skagway on credit. I ate my stale cakes and drank lake water, andthus fooled the little Jap steward out of two dollars. It was a sadbusiness, but unavoidable.The lake being smooth, the trip consumed but thirteen hours, and wearrived at Bennett Lake late at night. Hoisting my bed and luggage tomy shoulder, I went up on the side-hill like a stray dog, and made mybed down on the sand beside a cart, near a shack. The wind, cold anddamp, swept over the mountains with a roar. I was afraid the ownersof the cart might discover me there, and order me to seek a bedelsewhere. Dogs sniffed around me during the night, but on the wholeI slept very well. I could feel the sand blowing over me in the wildgusts of wind which relented not in all my stay at Bennett City.I spent literally the last cent I had on a scanty breakfast, andthen, in company with Doctor G. (a fellow prospector), started on myreturn to the coast over the far-famed Chilcoot Pass.At 9 A.M. we took the little ferry for the head of Lindernan Lake.The doctor paid my fare. The boat, a wabbly craft, was crowded withreturning Klondikers, many of whom were full of importance and talkof their wealth; while others, sick and worn, with a wistful gleam intheir eyes, seemed eager to get back to civilization and medicalcare. There were some women, also, who had made a fortune indance-houses and were now bound for New York and Paris, where dressescould be had in the latest styles and in any quantities.My travelling mate, the doctor, was a tall and vigorous man fromWinnipeg, accustomed to a plainsman's life, hardy and resolute. Hesaid, "We ought to make Dyea to-day." I said in reply, "Very well, wecan try."It was ten o'clock when we left the little boat and hit the trail,which was thirty miles long, and passed over the summit threethousand six hundred feet above the sea. The doctor's pace wastremendous, and we soon left every one else behind.I carried my big coat and camera, which hindered me not a little. Forthe first part of the journey the doctor preceded me, his broadshoulders keeping off the powerful wind and driving mist, which grewthicker as we rose among the ragged cliffs beside a roaring stream.That walk was a grim experience. Until two o'clock we climbedresolutely along a rough, rocky, and wooded trail, with the heavymist driving into our faces. The road led up a rugged cañon and overa fairly good wagon road until somewhere about twelve o'clock. Thenthe foot trail deflected to the left, and climbed sharply overslippery ledges, along banks of ancient snows in which carcasses ofhorses lay embedded, and across many rushing little streams. The waygrew grimmer each step. At last we came to Crater Lake, and from thatpoint on it was a singular and sinister land of grassless cragsswathed in mist. Nothing could be seen at this point but a desolate,flat expanse of barren sands over which gray-green streams wanderedin confusion, coming from darkness and vanishing in obscurity.Strange shapes showed in the gray dusk of the Crater. It was like alandscape in hell. It seemed to be the end of the earth, where nolife had ever been or could long exist.Across this flat to its farther wall we took our way, facing theroaring wind now heavy with clouds of rain. At last we stood in themighty notch of the summit, through which the wind rushed as thoughhurrying to some far-off, deep-hidden vacuum in the world. The peaksof the mountains were lost in clouds out of which water fell invicious slashes.The mist set the imagination free. The pinnacles around us were likethose which top the Valley of Desolation. We seemed each moment aboutto plunge into ladderless abysses. Nothing ever imagined by Poe orDoré could be more singular, more sinister, than these summits insuch a light, in such a storm. It might serve as the scene for anexiled devil. The picture of Beelzebub perched on one of those gray,dimly seen crags, his form outlined in the mist, would shake theheart. I thought of "Peer Gynt" wandering in the high home of theTrolls. Crags beetled beyond crags, and nothing could be heard butthe wild waters roaring in the obscure depths beneath our feet. Therewas no sky, no level place, no growing thing, no bird or beast,--onlycrates of bones to show where some heartless master had pushed afaithful horse up these terrible heights to his death.And here--just here in a world of crags and mist--I heard a shout oflaughter, and then bursting upon my sight, strong-limbed, erect, andfull-bosomed, appeared a girl. Her face was like a rain-wet rose--asplendid, unexpected flower set in this dim and gray and desolateplace. Fearlessly she fronted me to ask the way, a laugh upon herlips, her big gray eyes confident of man's chivalry, modest andsincere. I had been so long among rude men and their coarse consortsthat this fair woman lit the mist as if with sudden sunshine--just amoment and was gone. There were others with her, but they passedunnoticed. There in the gloom, like a stately pink rose, I set theGirl of the Mist.Sheep Camp was the end of the worst portion of the trail. I had nowcrossed both the famed passes, much improved of course. They are nolonger dangerous (a woman in good health can cross them easily), butthey are grim and grievous ways. They reek of cruelty and everyassociation that is coarse and hard. They possess a peculiar value tome in that they throw into fadeless splendor the wealth, the calm,the golden sunlight which lay upon the proud beauty of Atlin Lake.The last hours of the trip formed a supreme test of endurance. AtSheep Camp, a wet and desolate shanty town, eight miles from Dyea, wecame upon stages just starting over our road. But as they were allopen carriages, and we were both wet with perspiration and rain, andhungry and tired, we refused to book passage."To ride eight miles in an open wagon would mean a case of pneumoniato me," I said."Quite right," said the doctor, and we pulled out down the road at asmart clip.The rain had ceased, but the air was raw and the sky gray, and I wasvery tired, and those eight miles stretched out like a rubber string.Night fell before we had passed over half the road, which lay for themost part down the flat along the Chilcoot River. In fact, we crossedthis stream again and again. In places there were bridges, but mostof the crossings were fords where it was necessary to wade throughthe icy water above our shoe tops. Our legs, numb and weary, threwoff this chill with greater pain each time. As the night fell wecould only see the footpath by the dim shine of its surface pattedsmooth by the moccasined feet of the Indian packers. At last I walkedwith a sort of mechanical action which was dependent on mysubconscious will. There was nothing else to do but to go through.The doctor was a better walker than I. His long legs had more reachas well as greater endurance. Nevertheless he admitted being about astired as ever in his life.At last, when it seemed as though I could not wade any more of thoseicy streams and continue to walk, we came in sight of the electriclights on the wharfs of Dyea, sparkling like jewels against the graynight. Their radiant promise helped over the last mile miraculously.We were wet to the knees and covered with mud as we entered upon thestraggling street of the decaying town. We stopped in at the firstrestaurant to get something hot to eat, but found ourselves almosttoo tired to enjoy even pea soup. But it warmed us up a little, andkeeping on down the street we came at last to a hotel of verycomfortable accommodations. We ordered a fire built to dry ourclothing, and staggered up the stairs.That ended the goldseekers' trail for me. Henceforward I intended toride--nevertheless I was pleased to think I could still walk thirtymiles in eleven hours through a rain storm, and over a summit threethousand six hundred feet in height. The city had not entirely eatenthe heart out of my body.We arose from a dreamless sleep, somewhat sore, but in amazingly goodtrim considering our condition the night before, and made our wayinto our muddy clothing with grim resolution. After breakfast we tooka small steamer which ran to Skagway, where we spent the dayarranging to take the steamer to the south. We felt quite at home inSkagway now, and Chicago seemed not very far away. Having madeconnection with my bankers I stretched out in my twenty-five centbunk with the assurance of a gold king.Here the long trail took a turn. I had been among the miners andhunters for four months. I had been one of them. I had lived theessentials of their lives, and had been able to catch from them somehint of their outlook on life. They were a disappointment to me insome ways. They seemed like mechanisms. They moved as if drawn bysome great magnet whose centre was Dawson City. They appeared todrift on and in toward that human maelstrom going irresolutely totheir ruin. They did not seem to me strong men--on the contrary, theyseemed weak men--or men strong with one insane purpose. They settheir faces toward the golden north, and went on and on through everyobstacle like men dreaming, like somnambulists--bending their backsto the most crushing burdens, their faces distorted with effort. "Onto Dawson!" "To the Klondike!" That was all they knew.I overtook them in the Fraser River Valley, I found them in Hazleton.They were setting sail at Bennett, tugging oars on the Hotalinqua,and hundreds of them were landing every day at Dawson, there to standwith lax jaws waiting for something to turn up--lost among thousandsof their kind swarming in with the same insane purpose.Skagway was to me a sad place. On either side rose green mountainscovered with crawling glaciers. Between these stern walls, a cold andviolent wind roared ceaselessly from the sea gates through which theships drive hurriedly. All these grim presences depressed me. Ilonged for release from them. I waited with impatience the coming ofthe steamer which was to rescue me from the merciless beach.At last it came, and its hoarse boom thrilled the heart of many ahomesick man like myself. We had not much to put aboard, and when Iclimbed the gang-plank it was with a feeling of fortunate escape.A GIRL ON THE TRAIL    A flutter of skirts in the dapple of leaves on the trees,    The sound of a small, happy voice on the breeze,    The print of a slim little foot on the trail,    And the miners rejoice as they hammer with picks in    the vale.    For fairer than gold is the face of a maid,    And sovereign as stars the light of her eyes;    For women alone were the long trenches laid;    For women alone they defy the stern skies.    These toilers are grimy, and hairy, and dun    With the wear of the wind, the scorch of the sun;    But their picks fall slack, their foul tongues are mute--    As the maiden goes by these earthworms salute!CHAPTER XXIVHOMEWARD BOUNDThe steamer was crowded with men who had also made the turn at theend of the trail. There were groups of prospectors (disappointed andsour) from Copper River, where neither copper nor gold had beenfound. There were miners sick and broken who had failed on theTanana, and others, emaciated and eager-eyed, from Dawson City goingout with a part of the proceeds of the year's work to see their wivesand children. There were a few who considered themselves greatcapitalists, and were on their way to spend the winter in luxury inthe Eastern cities, and there were grub stakers who had squanderedtheir employers' money in drink and gaming.None of them interested me very greatly. I was worn out with thefilth and greed and foolishness of many of these men. They werecommonplace citizens, turned into stampeders without experience orskill.One of the most successful men on the boat had been a truckman in thestreets of Tacoma, and was now the silly possessor of a one-thirdinterest in some great mines on the Klondike River. He told every oneof his great deeds, and what he was worth. He let us know how bighis house was, and how much he paid for his piano. He was not a badman, he was merely a cheap man, and was followed about by a gang ofheelers to whom drink was luxury and vice an entertainment. Theseparasites slapped the teamster on the shoulder and listened to everyempty phrase he uttered, as though his gold had made of him somethingsacred and omniscient.I had no interest in him till being persuaded to play the fiddle hesat in the "social room," and sawed away on "Honest John," "TheDevil's Dream," "Haste to the Wedding," and "The Fisher's Hornpipe."He lost all sense of being a millionnaire, and returned to hissimple, unsophisticated self. The others cheered him because he hadgold. I cheered him because he was a good old "corduroy fiddler."Again we passed between the lofty blue-black and bronze-green wallsof Lynn Canal. The sea was cold, placid, and gray. The mist cut themountains at the shoulder. Vast glaciers came sweeping down from thedread mystery of the upper heights. Lower still lines of runningwater white as silver came leaping down from cliff to cliff--slender,broken of line, nearly perpendicular--to fall at last into the grayhell of the sea.It was a sullen land which menaced as with lowering brows andclenched fists. A landscape without delicacy of detail or warmth orvariety of color--a land demanding young, cheerful men. It was noplace for the old or for women.As we neared Wrangell the next afternoon I tackled the purser aboutcarrying my horse. He had no room, so I left the boat in order towait for another with better accommodations for Ladrone.Almost the first man I met on the wharf was Donald."How's the horse?" I queried."Gude!--fat and sassy. There's no a fence in a' the town can holdhim. He jumped into Colonel Crittendon's garden patch, and there's adollar to pay for the cauliflower he ate, and he broke down a fenceby the church, ye've to fix that up--but he's in gude trim himsel'.""Tell 'm to send in their bills," I replied with vast relief. "Has hebeen much trouble to you?""Verra leetle except to drive into the lot at night. I had but to godown where he was feeding and soon as he heard me comin' he made forthe lot--he knew quite as well as I did what was wanted of him. He'sa canny old boy."As I walked out to find the horse I discovered his paths everywhere.He had made himself entirely at home. He owned the village and wasable to walk any sidewalk in town. Everybody knew his habits. Hedrank in a certain place, and walked a certain round of dailyfeeding. The children all cried out at me: "Goin' to find the horsie?He's over by the church." A darky woman smiled from the door of acabin and said, "You ole hoss lookin' mighty fine dese days."When I came to him I was delighted and amused. He had taken on somefat and a great deal of dirt. He had also acquired an aldermanicpaunch which quite destroyed his natural symmetry of body, but hewas well and strong and lively. He seemed to recognize me, and as Iput the rope about his neck and fell to in the effort to make himclean once more, he seemed glad of my presence.That day began my attempt to get away. I carted out my feed andsaddles, and when all was ready I sat on the pier and watched theburnished water of the bay for the dim speck which a steamer makes inrounding the distant island. At last the cry arose, "A steamer fromthe north!" I hurried for Ladrone, and as I passed with the horse thecitizens smiled incredulously and asked, "Goin' to take the horsewith you, eh?"The boys and girls came out to say good-by to the horse on whose backthey had ridden. Ladrone followed me most trustfully, lookingstraight ahead, his feet clumping loudly on the boards of the walk.Hitching him on the wharf I lugged and heaved and got everything inreadiness.In vain! The steamer had no place for my horse and I was forced towalk him back and turn him loose once more upon the grass. I renewedmy watching. The next steamer did not touch at the same wharf.Therefore I carted all my goods, feed, hay, and general plunder,around to the other wharf. As I toiled to and fro the citizens beganto smile very broadly. I worked like a hired man in harvest. At last,horse, feed, and baggage were once more ready. When the next boatcame in I timidly approached the purser.No, he had no place for me but would take my horse! Once more I ledLadrone back to pasture and the citizens laughed most unconcealedly.They laid bets on my next attempt. In McKinnon's store I was greetedas a permanent citizen of Fort Wrangell. I began to grow nervous onmy own account. Was I to remain forever in Wrangell? The bay was mostbeautiful, but the town was wretched. It became each day moreunendurable to me. I searched the waters of the bay thereafter, withgaze that grew really anxious. I sat for hours late at night holdingmy horse and glaring out into the night in the hope to see the lightsof a steamer appear round the high hills of the coast.At last the _Forallen_, a great barnyard of a ship, came in. I metthe captain. I paid my fare. I got my contract and ticket, andleading Ladrone into the hoisting box I stepped aside.The old boy was quiet while I stood near, but when the whistlesounded and the sling rose in air leaving me below, his big eyesflashed with fear and dismay. He struggled furiously for a moment andthen was quiet. A moment later he dropped into the hold and was safe.He thought himself in a barn once more, and when I came hurrying downthe stairway he whinnied. He seized the hay I put before him andthereafter was quite at home.The steamer had a score of mules and work horses on board, but theyoccupied stalls on the upper deck, leaving Ladrone aristocraticallyalone in his big, well-ventilated barn, and there three times eachday I went to feed and water him. I rubbed him with hay till his coatbegan to glimmer in the light and planned what I could do to helphim through a storm. Fortunately the ocean was perfectly smooth evenacross the entrance to Queen Charlotte's Sound, where the open seaenters and the big swells are sometimes felt. Ladrone never knew hewas moving at all.The mate of the boat took unusual interest in the horse because ofhis deeds and my care of him.Meanwhile I was hearing from time to time of my fellow-sufferers onthe Long Trail. It was reported in Wrangell that some of theunfortunates were still on the snowy divide between the Skeena andthe Stikeen. That terrible trail will not soon be forgotten by anyone who traversed it.On the fifth day we entered Seattle and once more the sling-boxopened its doors for Ladrone. This time he struggled not at all. Heseemed to say: "I know this thing. I tried it once and it didn't hurtme--I'm not afraid."Now this horse belongs to the wild country. He was born on thebunch-grass hills of British Columbia and he had never seen astreet-car in his life. Engines he knew something about, but notmuch. Steamboats and ferries he knew a great deal about; but all thestrange monsters and diabolical noises of a city street were new tohim, and it was with some apprehension that I took his rein to leadhim down to the freight depot and his car.Again this wonderful horse amazed me. He pointed his alert andquivering ears at me and followed with never so much as a singlestart or shying bound. He seemed to reason that as I had led himthrough many dangers safely I could still be trusted. Around us hugetrucks rattled, electric cars clanged, railway engines whizzed andscreamed, but Ladrone never so much as tightened the rein; and whenin the dark of the chute (which led to the door of the car) he puthis soft nose against me to make sure I was still with him, my heartgrew so tender that I would not have left him behind for a thousanddollars.I put him in a roomy box-car and bedded him knee-deep in clean yellowstraw. I padded the hitching pole with his blanket, moistened hishay, and put some bran before him. Then I nailed him in and took myleave of him with some nervous dread, for the worst part of hisjourney was before him. He must cross three great mountain ranges andride eight days, over more than two thousand miles of railway. Icould not well go with him, but I planned to overhaul him at Spokaneand see how he was coming on.I did not sleep much that night. I recalled how the great foresttrees were blazing last year when I rode over this same track. Ithought of the sparks flying from the engine, and how easy it wouldbe for a single cinder to fall in the door and set all that dry strawablaze. I was tired and my mind conjured up such dire images as mendream of after indigestible dinners.O THE FIERCE DELIGHT    O the fierce delight, the passion      That comes from the wild,    Where the rains and the snows go over,      And man is a child.    Go, set your face to the open,      And lay your breast to the blast,    When the pines are rocking and groaning,      And the rent clouds tumble past.    Go swim the streams of the mountains,      Where the gray-white waters are mad,    Go set your foot on the summit,      And shout and be glad!CHAPTER XXVLADRONE TRAVELS IN STATEWith a little leisure to walk about and talk with the citizens ofSeattle, I became aware of a great change since the year before. Theboom of the goldseeker was over. The talk was more upon the Spanishwar; the business of outfitting was no longer paramount; the recklesshurrah, the splendid exultation, were gone. Men were sailing to thenorth, but they embarked, methodically, in business fashion.It is safe to say that the north will never again witness such afurious rush of men as that which took place between August, '97, andJune, '98. Gold is still there, and it will continue to be sought,but the attention of the people is directed elsewhere. In Seattle, asall along the line, the talk a year ago had been almost entirely ongold hunting. Every storekeeper advertised Klondike goods, but thesesigns were now rusty and faded. The fever was over, the reign of thehumdrum was restored.Taking the train next day, I passed Ladrone in the night somewhere,and as I looked from my window at the great fires blazing in theforest, my fear of his burning came upon me again. At Spokane Iwaited with great anxiety for him to arrive. At last the train drewin and I hurried to his car. The door was closed, and as I nervouslyforced it open he whinnied with that glad chuckling a gentle horseuses toward his master. He had plenty of hay, but was hot andthirsty, and I hurried at risk of life and limb to bring him coolwater. His eyes seemed to shine with delight as he saw me coming withthe big bucket of cool drink. Leaving him a tub of water, I bade himgood-by once more and started him for Helena, five hundred milesaway.At Missoula, the following evening, I rushed into the ticket officeand shouted, "Where is '54'?"The clerk knew me and smilingly extended his hand."How de do? She has just pulled out. The horse is all OK. We gave himfresh water and feed."I thanked him and returned to my train.Reaching Livingston in the early morning I was forced to wait nearlyall day for the train. This was no hardship, however, for it enabledme to return once more to the plain. All the old familiar presenceswere there. The splendid sweep of brown, smooth hills, the glory ofclear sky, the crisp exhilarating air, appealed to me with greatpower after my long stay in the cold, green mountains of the north.I walked out a few miles from the town over the grass brittle andhot, from which the clapping grasshoppers rose in swarms, anddropping down on the point of a mesa I relived again in drowse thejoys of other days. It was plain to me that goldseeking in the RockyMountains was marvellously simple and easy compared to even the bestsections of the Northwest, and the long journey of the Forty-ninerswas not only incredibly more splendid and dramatic, but had theallurement of a land of eternal summer beyond the final great range.The long trail I had just passed was not only grim and monotonous,but led toward an ever increasing ferocity of cold and darkness tothe arctic circle and the silence of death.When the train came crawling down the pink and purple slopes of thehills at sunset that night, I was ready for my horse. Bridle in handI raced after the big car while it was being drawn up into thefreight yards. As I galloped I held excited controversy with the headbrakeman. I asked that the car be sent to the platform. He objected.I insisted and the car was thrown in. I entered, and while Ladronewhinnied glad welcome I knocked out some bars, bridled him, and said,"Come, boy, now for a gambol." He followed me without the slightesthesitation out on the platform and down the steep slope to theground. There I mounted him without waiting for saddle and away weflew.He was gay as a bird. His neck arched and his eyes and ears werequick as squirrels. We galloped down to the Yellowstone River andonce more he thrust his dusty nozzle deep into the clear mountainwater. Then away he raced until our fifteen minutes were up. I wasglad to quit. He was too active for me to enjoy riding without asaddle. Right up to the door of the car he trotted, seeming tounderstand that his journey was not yet finished. He enteredunhesitatingly and took his place. I battened down the bars, nailedthe doors into place, filled his tub with cold water, mixed him abran mash, and once more he rolled away. I sent him on this time,however, with perfect confidence. He was actually getting fat on hisprison fare, and was too wise to allow himself to be bruised by thejolting of the cars.The bystanders seeing a horse travelling in such splendid lonelinessasked, "Runnin' horse?" and I (to cover my folly) replied evasively,"He can run a little for good money." This satisfied every one thathe was a sprinter and quite explained his private car.At Bismarck I found myself once more ahead of "54" and waited all dayfor the horse to appear. As the time of the train drew near Iborrowed a huge water pail and tugged a supply of water out besidethe track and there sat for three hours, expecting the train eachmoment. At last it came, but Ladrone was not there. His car wasmissing. I rushed into the office of the operator: "Where's the horsein '13,238'?" I asked."I don't know," answered the agent, in the tone of one who didn'tcare.Visions of Ladrone side-tracked somewhere and perishing for want ofair and water filled my mind. I waxed warm."That horse must be found at once," I said. The clerks and operatorswearily looked out of the window. The idea of any one being soconcerned about a horse was to them insanity or worse. I insisted. Ibanged my fist on the table. At last one of the young men yawnedlanguidly, looked at me with dim eyes, and as one brain-cellcoalesced with another seemed to mature an idea. He said:--"Rheinhart had a horse this morning on his extra.""Did he--maybe that's the one." They discussed this probability withlazy indifference. At last they condescended to include me in theirconversation.I insisted on their telegraphing till they found that horse, and withan air of distress and saint-like patience the agent wrote out atelegram and sent it. Thereafter he could not see me; nevertheless Ipersisted. I returned to the office each quarter of an hour to ask ifan answer had come to the telegram. At last it came. Ladrone wasahead and would arrive in St. Paul nearly twelve hours before me. Ithen telegraphed the officers of the road to see that he did notsuffer and composed myself as well as I could for the long wait.At St. Paul I hurried to the freight office and found the horse hadbeen put in a stable. I sought the stable, and there, among the bigdray horses, looking small and trim as a racer, was the lost horse,eating merrily on some good Minnesota timothy. He was just as much atease there as in the car or the boat or on the marshes of the Skeenavalley, but he was still a half-day's ride from his final home.I bustled about filling up another car. Again for the last time Isweated and tugged getting feed, water, and bedding. Again therailway hands marvelled and looked askance. Again some one said,"Does it pay to bring a horse like that so far?""Pay!" I shouted, thoroughly disgusted, "does it pay to feed a dogfor ten years? Does it pay to ride a bicycle? Does it pay to bring upa child? Pay--no; it does not pay. I'm amusing myself. You drink beerbecause you like to, you use tobacco--I squander my money on ahorse." I said a good deal more than the case demanded, being hot anddusty and tired and--I had broken loose. The clerk escaped through aside door.Once more I closed the bars on the gray and saw him wheeled out intothe grinding, jolting tangle of cars where the engines cried out likesome untamable flesh-eating monsters. The light was falling, thesmoke thickening, and it was easy to imagine a tragic fate for thepatient and lonely horse.Delay in getting the car made me lose my train and I was obliged totake a late train which did not stop at my home. I was still payingfor my horse out of my own bone and sinew. At last the luscious greenhills, the thick grasses, the tall corn-shocks and the portlyhay-stacks of my native valley came in view and they never looked soabundant, so generous, so entirely sufficing to man and beast as nowin returning from a land of cold green forests, sparse grass, and icystreams.At ten o'clock another huge freight train rolled in, Ladrone's carwas side-tracked and sent to the chute. For the last time he felt thejolt of the car. In a few minutes I had his car opened and a planklaid."Come, boy!" I called. "This is home."He followed me as before, so readily, so trustingly, my heartresponded to his affection. I swung to the saddle. With neck archedhigh and with a proud and lofty stride he left the door of his prisonbehind him. His fame had spread through the village. On every cornerstood the citizens to see him pass.As I opened the door to the barn I said to him:--"Enter! Your days of thirst, of hunger, of cruel exposure to rain andsnow are over. Here is food that shall not fail," and he seemed tounderstand.It might seem absurd if I were to give expression to the relief anddeep pleasure it gave me to put that horse into that familiar stall.He had been with me more than four thousand miles. He had carried methrough hundreds of icy streams and over snow fields. He hadresponded to every word and obeyed every command. He had sufferedfrom cold and hunger and poison. He had walked logs and wallowedthrough quicksands. He had helped me up enormous mountains and I hadguided him down dangerous declivities. His faithful heart had neverfailed even in days of direst need, and now he shall live amid plentyand have no care so long as he lives. It does not pay,--that issure,--but after all what does pay?THE LURE OF THE DESERT    I lie in my blanket, alone, alone!    Hearing the voice of the roaring rain,    And my heart is moved by the wind's low moan    To wander the wastes of the wind-worn plain,    Searching for something--I cannot tell--    The face of a woman, the love of a child--    Or only the rain-wet prairie swell    Or the savage woodland wide and wild.    I must go away--I know not where!    Lured by voices that cry and cry,    Drawn by fingers that clutch my hair,    Called to the mountains bleak and high,    Led to the mesas hot and bare.    O God! How my heart's blood wakes and thrills    To the cry of the wind, the lure of the hills.    I'll follow you, follow you far;    Ye voices of winds, and rain and sky,    To the peaks that shatter the evening star.    Wealth, honor, wife, child--all    I have in the city's keep,    I loose and forget when ye call and call    And the desert winds around me sweep.CHAPTER XXVITHE GOLDSEEKERS REACH THE GOLDEN RIVERThe goldseekers are still seeking. I withdrew, but they went on. Inthe warmth and security of my study, surrounded by the peace andcomfort of my native Coolly, I thought of them as they went toilingover the trail, still toward the north. It was easy for me to imaginetheir daily life. The Manchester boys and Burton, my partner, leftGlenora with ten horses and more than two thousand pounds ofsupplies.Twice each day this immense load had to be handled; sometimes inorder to rest and graze the ponies, every sack and box had to betaken down and lifted up to their lashings again four times each day.This meant toil. It meant also constant worry and care while thetrain was in motion. Three times each day a campfire was built andcoffee and beans prepared.However, the weather continued fair, my partner wrote me, and theyarrived at Teslin Lake in September, after being a month on the road,and there set about building a boat to carry them down the river.Here the horses were sold, and I know it must have been a sad momentfor Burton to say good-by to his faithful brutes. But there was nohelp for it. There was no more thought of going to the head-watersof the Pelly and no more use for the horses. Indeed, the gold-huntersabandoned all thought of the Nisutlin and the Hotalinqua. They werefairly in the grasp of the tremendous current which seemed to getever swifter as it approached the mouth of the Klondike River. Theywere mad to reach the pool wherein all the rest of the world wasfishing. Nothing less would satisfy them.At last they cast loose from the shore and started down the river,straight into the north. Each hour, each mile, became a menace. Dayby day they drifted while the spitting snows fell hissing into thecold water, and ice formed around the keel of the boat at night. Theypassed men camped and panning dirt, but continued resolute, haltingonly "to pass the good word."It grew cold with appalling rapidity and the sun fell away to thesouth with desolating speed. The skies darkened and lowered as thedays shortened. All signs of life except those of other argonautsdisappeared. The river filled with drifting ice, and each nightlanding became more difficult.At last the winter came. The river closed up like an iron trap, andbefore they knew it they were caught in the jam of ice and fightingfor their lives. They landed on a wooded island after a desperatestruggle and went into camp with the thermometer thirty below zero.But what of that? They were now in the gold belt. After six months ofincessant toil, of hope deferred, they were at last on the spottoward which they had struggled.All around them was the overflow from the Klondike. Their desire togo farther was checked. They had reached the counter current--theback-water--and were satisfied.Leaving to others the task of building a permanent camp, my sturdypartner, a couple of days later, started prospecting in company withtwo others whom he had selected to represent the other outfit. Thethermometer was fifty-six degrees below zero, and yet for seven days,with less than six hours' sleep, without a tent, those devoted idiotshunted the sands of a near-by creek for gold, and really stakedclaims.On the way back one of the men grew sleepy and would have lain downto die except for the vigorous treatment of Burton, who mauled himand dragged him about and rubbed him with snow until his blood beganto circulate once more. In attempting to walk on the river, which wasagain in motion, Burton fell through, wetting one leg above the knee.It was still more than thirty degrees below zero, but what of that?He merely kept going.They reached the bank opposite the camp late on the seventh day, butwere unable to cross the moving ice. For the eighth night they"danced around the fire as usual," not daring to sleep for fear offreezing. They literally frosted on one side while scorching at thefire on the other, turning like so many roasting pigs before theblaze. The river solidified during the night and they crossed to thecamp to eat and sleep in safety.A couple of weeks later they determined to move down the river to anew stampede in Thistle Creek. Once more these indomitable soulsleft their warm cabin, took up their beds and nearly two thousandpounds of outfit and toiled down the river still farther into theterrible north. The chronicle of this trip by Burton is ofmathematical brevity: "On 20th concluded to move. Took four days.Very cold. Ther. down to 45 below. Froze one toe. Got claim--nowbuilding cabin. Expect to begin singeing in a few days."The toil, the suffering, the monotonous food, the lack of fire, hedid not dwell upon, but singeing, that is to say burning down throughthe eternally frozen ground, was to begin at once. To singe a holeinto the soil ten or fifteen feet deep in the midst of the sunlessseventy of the arctic circle is no light task, but these men will doit; if hardihood and honest toil are of any avail they will all sharein the precious sand whose shine has lured them through all the darkdays of the long trail, calling with such power that nothing couldstay them or turn them aside.If they fail, well--    This out of all will remain,    They have lived and have tossed.    So much of the game will be gain,    Though the gold of the dice has been lost.HERE THE TRAIL ENDS    Here the trail ends--Here by a river    So swifter, and darker, and colder    Than any we crossed on our long, long way.    Steady, Dan, steady. Ho, there, my dapple,    You first from the saddle shall slip and be free.    Now go, you are clear from command of a master;    Go wade in the grasses, go munch at the grain.    I love you, my faithful, but all is now over;    Ended the comradeship held 'twixt us twain.    I go to the river and the wide lands beyond it,    You go to the pasture, and death claims us all.    _For here the trail ends!_    _Here the trail ends!_    Draw near with the broncos.    Slip the hitch, loose the cinches,    Slide the saw-bucks away from each worn, weary back.    We are done with the axe, the camp, and the kettle;    Strike hand to each cayuse and send him away.    Let them go where the roses and grasses are growing,    To the meadows that slope to the warm western sea.    No more shall they serve us; no more shall they suffer    The sting of the lash, the heat of the day.    Soon they will go to a winterless haven,    To the haven of beasts where none may enslave.    _For here the trail ends_.    _Here the trail ends._    Never again shall the far-shining mountains allure us,    No more shall the icy mad torrents appall.    Fold up the sling ropes, coil down the cinches,    Cache the saddles, and put the brown bridles away.    Not one of the roses of Navajo silver,    Not even a spur shall we save from the rust.    Put away the worn tent-cloth, let the red people have it;    We are done with all shelter, we are done with the gun.    Not so much as a pine branch, not even a willow    Shall swing in the air 'twixt us and our God.    Naked and lone we cross the wide ferry,    Bare to the cold, the dark and the rain.    _For here the trail ends._    _Here the trail ends._ Here by the landing    I wait the last boat, the slow silent one.    We each go alone--no man with another,    Each into the gloom of the swift black flood--    Boys, it is hard, but here we must scatter;    The gray boatman waits, and I--I go first.    All is dark over there where the dim boat is rocking--    But that is no matter! No man need to fear;    For clearly we're told the powers that lead us    Shall govern the game to the end of the day.    _Good-by--here the trail ends!_       *       *       *       *       *WORKS BYGILBERT PARKER16mo.

It is here, and here alone,where a land of another continent approaches so near to America that apassage of man with primitive means of navigation and provisioning waspossible. All the affinities of the American native point toward themore eastern parts of Asia. In Siberia, Mongolia, Tibet, Manchuria,Formosa, and in some of the islands off southeastern Asia, livingremnants of the same type of man as the American aborigines are to thisday encountered, and it is here in the farthest northwest where actualpassings of parties of natives between the Asiatic coast and the BeringSea islands and between the latter and the American coasts have always,since these parts were known, been observed and are still of commonoccurrence.With these facts before them, the students of the peopling of thiscontinent were always drawn strongly to Alaska and the opposite partsof Asia; but the distances, the difficulties of communication, andthe high costs of exploration in these far-off regions have proven aserious hindrance to actual investigation. As a result, but littledirect, systematic, archeological or anthropological (somatological)research has ever been carried out in these regions; though sinceBering's, Cook's, and Vancouver's opening voyages to these parts alarge amount of general, cultural, and linguistic observations on thenatives has accumulated.For these observations, which are much in need of a compilation andcritical analysis, science is indebted to the above-named captains;to the subsequent Russian explorers, and especially to the Russianclerics who were sent to Alaska as missionaries or priests to thenatives; to various captains, traders, agents, miners, soldiers,and men in collateral branches of science, who came in contact withthe aborigines; to special United States Government exploratoryexpeditions, with an occasional participation of the Biological Surveyand the Smithsonian Institution, such as resulted in the fine "Corwin"reports and the highly valuable accounts of Leffingwell, Dall, Nelson,and Murdoch; to the separate pieces of scientific work by men such asGordon and Jennes; and to Jochelson and Bogoras of the Jesup exploringexpedition of the American Museum.As a result of all these contributions, it may be said that therehas been established a fair cultural and linguistic knowledge of theAleut, the Eskimo, and the Chukchee, not to speak of the Tlingit,consideration of which seems more naturally to fall with that of theIndians of the northwest coast.There are also numerous though often very imperfect and occasionallyrather contradictory notes on the physical status of these peoples,and some valuable cultural and even skeletal collections were made.Since 1912 we possess also a good series of measurements on the St.Lawrence Island natives, together with valuable cranial material fromthat locality, made, under the direction of the writer, by Riley D.Moore, at that time aide in the Division of Physical Anthropology inthe United States National Museum.The need of a further systematic archeological and somatologicalresearch in this important part of the world was long since felt,and several propositions were made in this line to the NationalResearch Council (Hrdlička) and to the Smithsonian Institution (Hough,Hrdlička); but nothing came of these until the early part of 1926,when, a little money becoming available, the writer was intrustedby the Bureau of American Ethnology with the making of an extensivepreliminary survey of Alaska. The objects of the trip were, in brief,to ascertain as much as possible about the surviving Indians andEskimos; to trace all indications of old settlements and migrations;and to collect such skeletal and archeological material as might be ofimportance.The trip occupied approximately four months, from the latter partof May to the latter part of September, affording a full season inAlaska. It began with the inside trip from Vancouver to Juneau, whereat several of the stopping places groups of the northwest coastIndians were observed. At Juneau examination was made of the valuablearcheological collections in the local museum. After this followed atrip with several stops along the gulf, a railroad trip with some stopsto Fairbanks, a return trip to Nenana, a boat trip on the Tanana to theYukon, and then, with little boats of various sorts, a trip with manystops for about 900 miles down the Yukon. This in turn was followed bya side trip in Norton Sound, after which transportation was securedto the island of St. Michael and to Nome. From Nome, after some workin the vicinity, the revenue cutter _Bear_ took the writer to the St.Lawrence and Diomede Islands, to Cape Wales, and thence from place toplace of scientific interest up to Barrow. On the return a number ofthe more important places, besides some new ones, were touched upon,while the visit to others was prevented by the increasing storms, andthe trip ended at Unalaska.Throughout the journey, the writer received help from the Governor,officials, missionaries, traders, and people of Alaska; from thecaptain, officers, and crew of the _Bear_; and from many individuals;for all of which cordial thanks are hereby once more rendered. Gratefulacknowledgments are especially due to the following gentlemen: GovernorGeorge A. Parks, of Alaska; Mr. Harry G. Watson, his secretary; Mr.Karl Thiele, Secretary for Alaska; Judge James Wickersham, formerlyDelegate from Alaska; Father A. P. Kashevaroff, curator of theTerritorial Museum and Library of Juneau; Dr. William Chase, ofCordova; Mr. Noel W. Smith, general manager Government railroad ofAlaska; Mr. B. B. Mozee, Indian supervisor, and Dr. J. A. Romig, ofAnchorage; Prof. C. E. Bunnell, president Alaska Agriculture College,at Fairbanks; Mr. and Mrs. Fullerton, missionaries, at Tanana; Rev.J. W. Chapman and Mr. Harry Lawrence, at Anvik; Father Jetté andJim Walker, at Holy Cross; Mr. C. Betsch, at the Russian Mission;Messrs. Frank Tucker and E. C. Gurtler, near the mission; Mr. Frank P.Williams, of St. Michael; Judge G. J. Lomen and his sons and daughter,at Nome; Rev. Dr. Baldwin, Fathers La Fortune and Post, Captain Ross,United States Coast Guard, and Mr. Elmer Rydeem, merchant, at Nome;C. S. Cochran, captain of the _Bear_, and his officers, particularlyMr. H. Berg, the boatswain; Rev. F. W. Goodman and Mr. LaVoy, at PointHope; the American teachers at Wales, Shishmareff, Kotzebue, PointHope, and elsewhere; Messrs. Tom Berryman, Jim Allen; and CharlesBrower, traders, respectively, at Kotzebue, Wainright, and Barrow; Mr.Sylvester Chance, superintendent of education, Kotzebue, Alaska; theUnited States marshals, deputy marshals, and postmasters along theroute; and the numerous traders, miners, settlers, and others who werehelpful with specimens, advice, guidance, and in other matters.GENERAL REMARKSThe account of the survey will be limited in the main toanthropological and archeological observations; but it is thoughtbest to give it largely in the form of the original notes made on thespot or within a few hours after an event. These notes often containcollateral observations or thoughts which could be excluded, butthe presence of which adds freshness, reliability, and some localatmosphere to what otherwise would be a rather dry narrative. Apreliminary account of the trip and its results was published in theSmithsonian exploration volume for 1926 (Washington, 1927, pp. 137-158).Not much reference is possible to previous work of the nature heredealt with in the parts visited, except in the Aleutian Islands, wheregood archeological work was done in the late sixties by William H.Dall,[1] and in 1909-10 by Waldemar Jochelson.[2]The archeology and anthropology of the Gulf of Alaska, the inland, theYukon Basin, the Bering Sea coasts and islands, and those of the Arcticcoasts up to Point Barrow are but little known. The archeology is inreality known only from the stone and old ivory implements that havebeen incidentally collected and have reached various institutions wherethey have been studied; from the excavations about Barrow, conductedby an expedition of the University Museum, Philadelphia, in charge ofW. B. Van Valin, and by the trader, Mr. Charles Brower, the resultsof which have not yet been published; and from the recent diggings atWales and on the smaller Diomede Island by Doctor Jenness.[3] NeitherDall, Nelson, Rau, nor Murdoch conducted any excavations outside thealready mentioned work in the Aleutians.FOOTNOTES:[1] Dall, Wm.

The boat stoppedat a number of settlements on the scenic "inside" route--whichimpresses one as a much enlarged and varied trip through theCatskills--permitting some observations on the Indians of these parts.The main opportunity was had at Aleut Bay. Here many British ColumbiaIndians were seen on the dock, belonging to several tribes. Names ofthese, as pronounced to me, were unfamiliar. They have a large agencyhere; engage in salmon industry. A minority, only, full bloods--of theyounger a large majority mixed (white blood). The full bloods all showone marked type, of short to moderate stature, rather short legs, hugechest and head, i. e., face. Color near onion-brown, without luster.Indians, but modified locally. Remind one (chest, stature, stockiness,shortness of neck and legs) of Peruvian Indians.Indians at Prince Rupert same type; color pale brown; eyes and noserather small for the faces in some, in others good size. Look good deallike some Chinese or rather some hand-laboring Chinese and Japaneselook like them.Indians at Juneau (the Auk tribe) very similar, but most mixed withwhites._Juneau._--A week was spent at Juneau, gathering information, obtainingletters of introduction, and making a few excursions. The city hasan excellent museum devoted to Alaskan history and archeology, underthe able curatorship of Father Andrew P. Kashevaroff, himself a partof the history of the Territory. The archeological collections ofAlaska Indians and Eskimos are in some respects--e. g., pottery--morecomprehensive than those of any other of our museums; but they,together with the valuable library, are housed in a frail framebuilding, under great risks from both fire and thieves. Fortunately thelatter are still scarce in Alaska, but the fire risk is great and everpresent. The museum is a decided cultural asset to Juneau.NOTES OF ARCHEOLOGICAL INTEREST_Auk Point._--Thanks to Father Kashevaroff and Mr. Charles H. Flory,the district forester, an excursion was arranged one day to Auk Point,approximately 15 miles distant, a picturesque wooded little promontorynear which there used to be a settlement of the Auk Indians. On thepoint were several burials of shamans and a chief of the tribe (allother dead being cremated), and near the graves stood until a shorttime ago a moderate-sized totem pole. Of all this we found but bareremnants. The burials of three shamans and one chief had been in hugeboxes above ground; but they had all been broken into and most of thecontents belonging to the dead were taken away, including the skulls.The skeletal parts of two of the bodies and a few bones of the chiefremained, however, with a few objects the vandals had overlooked. Thelatter were placed in the Juneau Museum while the bones, showing somefeatures of interest, were collected and sent to Washington. A largepainted board near the graves of the shamans remained, though damaged.The totem pole, however, had been cut down the year before by a youngman from Juneau, who then severed the head, which he carried home,and left the rest on the beach, from where it was soon washed away.Thus a group of burials, the only ones known of the once good-sized Auktribe, have been despoiled and their record lost to science. And such afate is, according to all accounts, rapidly overtaking similar remainseverywhere in southeastern Alaska._Rare stone lamp (?)._--At the museum one of the first and mostinteresting objects shown the writer by Father Kashevaroff was alarge, heavy, finely sculptured oblong bowl, made of hard, darkcrystalline stone, decorated in relief on the rim and with a squattingstone figure, cut from the same piece, near one of the ends. Thebowl looks like a ceremonial lamp, though showing no trace of oil orcarbon. Subsequently four other bowls of this same remarkable typeand workmanship were learned of, two, the best of the lot, in theUniversity Museum at Philadelphia; one in the Museum of the AmericanIndian, New York; and one, somewhat inferior and of reddish stone, inthe possession of Mr. Müller, the trader at Kaltag, on the Yukon (laterin that of Mr. Lynn Smith, marshal at Fairbanks). The localities wherethe five remarkable and high-grade specimens have been found rangefrom the Kenai Peninsula in southwestern Alaska to the lower Yukon.The Juneau specimen comes from Fish Creek, near Kuik, Cook Inlet (seeDescriptive Booklet Alaska Hist. Mus., Juneau, 1922, pp. 26, 27); thatin the Heye Museum is from the same locality; the one in Philadelphiawas found in the Kenai Peninsula; while that at Kaltag came from an oldIndian site on the Kaiuh slough of the Yukon. Locally, there is muchinclination to regard these specimens as Asiatic, especially Japanese,and a bronze Japanese Temple medal has been found near that now atJuneau. On the other hand, a strong suggestion of similarity to thesedishes is presented by some undecorated large stone lamps from Alaska,and by a class of pottery bowls with a human figure perched on therim at one end from some of the Arkansas mounds, Mexico, and farthersouthward. (See Mason, J. A. A remarkable stone lamp from Alaska. TheMuseum Jour., Phila., 1928, 170-194.)_Copper mask._--Shortly before leaving Juneau I became acquainted withMr. Robert Simpson, manager of the "Nugget" curio shop, and found inhis possession a number of interesting specimens made in the past bythe Tlingit Indians. An outstanding piece was an old copper mask, whichwas purchased for the National Museum. Mr. Simpson obtained it yearsago from a native of Yakutat and stored it with native furs and otherarticles of value. It originally belonged to a shaman of the Yakutattribe and was said to have been worn by him in sacrificial slavekillings, the shaman with the mask representing some mythical being. Itis an exceedingly good and rare piece of native workmanship._Copper "shield."_--Another interesting article secured from Mr.Simpson is a large old shieldlike plate of beaten copper, decorated onone side with a characteristic Tlingit engraved design. Mr. Simpson,in a letter to Doctor Hough, dated June 26, 1926, says: "The shield,or to speak more correctly the copper plate--for it was not used as ashield--was the most valuable possession of the Tlingits. They wereusually valued in slaves, this one, at the last known exchange, havingbeen traded for three slaves. The possessor of four or five such plateswas a man of the utmost wealth. Some claim that they got these copperplates from the early New England traders and others that they camefrom the Copper River. Either is possible. Lots of the Copper Rivernuggets were very large and flat and could have readily been hammeredinto plate form. I bought this in the village of Klawak on the westcoast of Prince of Wales Island. I do not know of another one aroundhere. All of the local elderly natives are familiar with its previousvalue, and when they have wandered into my shop to sell things theyalways made deep obeisance to this plate."_Talks._--While in Juneau the writer spoke before the Rotarians, whohonored him with a lunch; and later, in the auditorium of the fine newhigh school, gave a public lecture on "The Peopling of America," etc.The object of these and the many subsequent talks in Alaska was, onthe one hand, to reciprocate as far as possible the kindness and helpreceived on all sides, and on the other to leave wholesome informationand stimulus in things anthropological. The audience was invariablyall that a lecturer could desire, and many were left everywhere eagerfor help and cooperation. The aid of some of these men, includingprospectors, miners, settlers, engineers, foresters, and variousofficials, may some day prove of much value in the search for Alaskanantiquities._Juneau--Seward._--June 8, leave Juneau. It has been raining every day,with one exception, and is misting now, depriving us of a view of mostof the coast. Wherever there is a glimpse of it, however, it is seen tobe mountainous, wooded below, snowy and icy higher up, inhospitable,forbidding.June 10, arrive at Cordova, a former native and Russian settlementof some importance. Will stay here large part of the day and goto see about Indians, old sites, burials, and specimens, the mainhotel keeper, the assistant superintendent of the local railway, thepostmaster, the supervisor of the forests, and Dr. William Chase, whohas been connected with the work of the Biological Survey in theseregions. Mr. W. J. McDonald, the forester, takes me out some milesinto the very rugged country, where there are still plenty of bear andmountain goat. After which Doctor Chase takes me to the old Russianand Indian cemetery. There are many graves, mostly Indian, but also afew whites, and even a Chinaman. Russian crosses are still common. Theolder Indian part could be easily excavated. Learn of skulls and boneson "mummy" island in Prince William Sound._Indians._--See quite a few. Nearly all appear more or less mixed;color in these more or less pronounced tan with red in cheeks andsome tendency to paleness. Heads still all brachycephalic and of onlymoderate height; faces broad, noses not prominent, in males tend tolarge.Two adult men, evidently full-bloods--pure Indian type of thebrachycephalic form, head moderate in size, medium short, face notvery large, nose slightly or moderately convex, not prominent, butall Indian. Color of skin submedium to near medium brown, no trace ofwhitish or pink. Stature and build medium; feet rather small; hairtypical Indian, black, straight; beard sparse and short; mustachesparse, no hair on sides of the face.The boat makes two or three more commercial and passenger stopsbefore reaching Seward, the main one at Valdez, the terminal of theRichardson Trail to the interior. These stops permit us to see somefish canneries, which are of both general and anthropological interest.These establishments employ Japanese, Philippine, and Chinese labor,and it was found to be quite a task to distinguish these, and to tellthem from the coast Indians. The Chinamen can be distinguished mostoften, though not always, the Japanese less so, while the Filipinousually can not be told from the Indian, even by an expert. Here was astriking practical lesson in relationships._Seward--Anchorage._--Seward found to be a fine little town, full ofthe same good brand of people that one finds everywhere in Alaska andwho go so far to restore one's faith in humanity. It is the terminus ofthe Government railroad to Fairbanks and a port of some importance._Indian basketry._--No Indians were seen here, though some comeoccasionally. But several of the stores, including that of the SewardDrug Co. (Mr. Elwyn Swestmann), have an unexpectedly good supply ofdecorated Alaska Indian baskets. It was found later, in fact, that theAlaskan Indians, with the Aleutians, compare well in basketry withthose of Arizona and California._Anchorage._--June 12-13. Anchorage, on Cook's Inlet, is a good-sizedtown for Alaska and the headquarters of the railroad. Here were metsome very good friends, particularly Mr. Noel W. Smith, general managerof the railroad; Dr. J. H. Romig, formerly of the Kuskokwim; and Mr.B. B. Mozee, the Indian supervisor. Here, at Ellis Hall, I lecturedon "The Origin and Racial Affiliations of the Indians," and the largeaudience included seven male (some full blood) and two female (mixblood) Indians--of the latter, one very pretty, approaching a Spanishtype of beauty. Near town I also visited with a launch two small Indianfishing camps. From Doctor Romig information was obtained about theIndians and some old sites of the Kuskokwim; and through the kindnessof Messrs. Smith and Mozee I was enabled to visit the Indian school atEklutna. Here at Anchorage I also was given the first and rather rareold Indian stone implement.The Indians at the camps included 6 full bloods--4 men, 2 women. One ofthe men tested on chest. Typical full-blood results.Type of full bloods: Color slightly submedium to medium brown, neverdarker; heads, subbrachycephalic to full brachycephalic, rather small;forehead in men more or less sloping in two; face, not large, Indian;nose tends to convex but not high. Indian in features and behavior, butfeatures not as pronounced as general in the States tribes.The full bloods in town: Medium to short stature, not massive frames,moderate-sized faces, Indian type, but not the pronounced form; headbrachycephalic; hair all black; mustache and beard scarce, as inIndians in general; color of skin submedium brown. Children in camp(up to about 5 years) were striking by a relatively considerableinterorbital breadth, otherwise typical Indian._Birch-bark dishes._--At Anchorage, in several of the stores, butparticularly at one small store, were seen many nicely decoratedbirch-bark dishes or receptacles. They are made by inland Indians, areprettily decorated with colored porcupine quills, and evidently takethe place of the baskets of other tribes. It was difficult to learnjust what Indians made the best or most, though the Tanana people werementioned. No such fine assortment of these dishes was seen afterleaving Anchorage._Eklutna._--Sixteen miles from Anchorage, along the railroad, is theIndian village and school Eklutna. Mr. Smith made it possible for me toreach this place on a freight and to be picked up later the same day bythe passenger train.At Eklutna was found an isolated but prettily located and well-keptIndian school, with about fifty children from many parts ofsouthwestern Alaska. More than half of these children showed moreor less admixture of white blood, but there was a minority ofunquestionable full bloods. There were two children from Kodiak Islandand two or three southern Eskimo. The main impression after a detailedlook at the children was that, while they all showed clear Indianaffinities and some were typically Indian, yet on the whole therewas a prevalent trace of something Eskimoid in the physiognomies--anobservation that was to be repeated more than once in other parts ofIndian Alaska._Burials._--At a few minutes' walk from the school at Eklutna thereis in a clearing of the forest a small Indian village, with a lategraveyard showing Russian influence. A short distance farther, however,according to the Indians, there is an old burial place of somemagnitude, with traces of graves, although quite obliterated._Eklutna--Fairbanks._--Since reaching Seward the almost incessantdrizzles have ceased and the weather has been fine and pleasantly warm.Everything is green, grass is luxuriant, and there are many flowers.The railroad journey is a regular scenic tour, with its crowningpoint a glorious view of Mount McKinley. The trains run only in thedaytime. For the night a stop is made at a railroad hotel, in a quiet,picturesque location, at the edge of a good-sized river. They havefoxes in cages here and a tame reindeer. There are no natives in thisvicinity.There are two interesting passengers on the train, with both of whom Ibecame well acquainted. One is Joe Bernard, an explorer and collector(besides his other occupations) in Alaska and Siberia. He furnishesme with some valuable pictures and much information. The other man isCaptain Wilkins, the flier of Point Barrow fame, who strikes me as anable and modest man.The next day, as the train stops at Nenana, I am met, thanks to a wordsent by Mr. Noel W. Smith, by Chief Thomas and a group of his people.These behave kindly and tell me of a potlatch to be held at Tanana"after some days," where they will visit. The chief impresses me withhis rather refined though thoroughly Indian countenance._Fairbanks._--Before reaching Fairbanks, the inland capital of Alaska,I am met by Prof. C. E. Bunnell, head of the Alaska AgriculturalCollege. This college, located on an elevation about 4 miles out ofthe city, I visit with Professor Bunnell soon after arrival, to findthere some interesting paleontological and archeological collections.Here are fair beginnings which well deserve the good will of theAlaskans. Unfortunately the college has not yet the means for anysubstantial progress or research in these lines, and the collectionsare housed in a frame building where they are in serious danger fromfire. But their presence will aid, doubtless, in the saving of othermaterial of similar nature from the Tanana region, and specimens ofspecial scientific importance will doubtless be referred to scientificinstitutions outside.Fairbanks is a good-sized town, built on the wide flats of the TananaRiver. Its population, now reduced, includes some civilized natives,most of whom, however, are mix breeds. A large petrified mammothtusk on the porch of one of the semi-log houses shows that theseare regions of more than ordinary biological interest. And there issoon an occurrence which demonstrates this further. Mr. John Buckley,the deputy marshal, takes me to an old Japanese resident, now arooming-house keeper, who has had a hobby of collecting fossils, andwho in the end is happy to donate to the National Museum a fine skullof a fossil Alaskan horse, together with some other specimens, refusingall payment. Such is the human Alaska, or at least the most of it.Here, too, to a full hall in the library, a lecture is given on "ThePeopling of Alaska and America," after which follows a return to Nenanato catch a steamer to the Yukon.THE WRITER'S TRIP ON THE YUKONTANANA--YUKONJune 17. Nenana: This is a small town on the Tanana, mostly railroadbuildings, with a hospital; there is one street of stores (three shortblocks), most of them now empty. About half a mile off a small Indiansettlement about an Episcopalian mission.Country flat on both sides of the rather large river, except for somehills back of the right shore beyond the railroad bridge, for a shortdistance. The river flats seem scarcely 3 or 4 feet above water,overgrown with brush and a few scrubby trees, later spruce thickets.Purple flowers (fireweed) strike the eye.No relics found at Nenana; no information concerning old sites orabandoned villages along the stream.Physically, the Indians seen at Nenana were submedium brown, good manystill full blood, pure Indian type, brachycephalic, faces (nose, etc.),however, of but medium prominence. Moderate to good stature.They are all fairly "civilized," wear white men's clothing, to which ongala occasions are added bands or collars of beadwork, and speak moreor less English. The younger men are evidently good workers.The distance from Nenana to Tanana is given as about 190 miles by theriver.The government boat _Jacobs_, on which we shall go down the Tanana,is a moderate-sized, shallow-bottomed stern-wheeler, and, like allsuch boats on these rivers, will push a heavily laden freight bargebefore it. There are about a dozen passengers, the boat labor, a traderor two. All kindly, open. A few women--most of both sexes of theScandinavian type. On barge some horses, a cow, pigs, chickens.Leave after lunch--very good, generous, and pleasant meal in a localrestaurant that would do credit to a large city; only the people arebetter, more human. Meals $1, the almost universal price in Alaska.Some quaint expressions: When anyone has been away, especially to theStates, they say he was "outside." I am an "outsider;" show it "by mycollar." Underdone bacon is "easy." To assent they say "you bet." Ina restaurant, to a decent, cheerful girl: "May I have a little hotcoffee?" "You bet!" Which bright answer is heard so often that onefinishes by being shy to ask.Dogs, of course, do not pull, but "mush." This is from the CanadianFrench "marche." Dogs do not understand "go" or "go on," only "mush."Extensive flats. Below Nenana these flats, plainly recent alluvial, aresaid to extend up to 60 miles to the left (southwestward) and to 20miles to the right. As one passes nearer they are seen to range from 3up to about 8 feet above the level of the river at this stage of water.Cabins and fishing camps along the river, mostly flimsy structures,with a few tents. Indians in some. The Indians are said by the whitesto be pretty lazy, living from day to day; yet they seem industriousenough in their own camps and in their own way.Storage or caches, little houses on stilts. Dog houses in rows. Curiouswheel fish traps, revolving like hay or wheat lifting machines, runby the current. They scoop out the fish and let them fall into a box,from which the fisherman collects them twice a day. It is the laziestfishing that could be devised. The contraption is said to come fromthe northwest coast, but has become one of the characteristic parts ofthe scenery along the Tanana and the Yukon. An Indian camp--stacks ofcordwood--canoes.The day is sunny, moderately warm and rather dry--about as a warm,dry, fall day with us. The river shows bars, with caught driftwood;also considerable floating wood. There are seagulls, said to destroyyoung ducks and geese and water birds' eggs. Shores now wooded, mainlypoplar, not large. Farther back and farther down, spruce.The river averages about 200 to 300 yards but differs much in placesand there are numerous side channels (sloughs). It is crooked; manybends. The current is quite marked, stated to run 4 to 6 miles an hour.The water is charged with grayish-brown silt, part from glaciers higherabove, part from banks that are being "cut." The banks are entirelysilt, no trace of gravel or stone. Indian camps getting very scarce.Boat making good time, but now and then requires careful manipulation,with its big, heavy barge in front. Once driven to shore, but nodamage, and after some effort gets away again. No trouble yet frommosquitoes, but there are some horseflies.Pass a large camp--a Finn married to a squaw, and three or four Indianfamilies--all snug in a clearing of the fresh-looking woods on the bankof the river.Bend after bend in the stream, and boat has to follow them all, andmore, for the current and deeper water are now near this bank and againat the opposite bank.The water in many places is undermining the bank, exposing frozenstrata of silt. The top often falls in without breaking, with trees andall, and it then looks like heavy, ragged mats hanging over the bank,with green trees or bushes dipping into the water, and perhaps a clumpof wild roses projecting from the sward. There are many low bushes ofwild roses in this country, pink and red kinds, now blooming. Also manysmall bushes of wild berries--cranberries (low and high), raspberries,dewberries or blueberries.Meat is imported even to here from Seattle, and carried far down theYukon. When received they place it in a "cellar" or hole dug down tothe frozen ground and place the meat there--a natural and thoroughlyefficient refrigerator.Past Old Minto, a little Indian village, a few little log houses in arow facing the river, with a wheel fish trap in front (pl. 1, _a_).Later a few Indian houses and a "road house" with a store at Tolovana.Most Indians there (and elsewhere here) died of the "flu" in 1918, thebodies being left and later buried by the Government. A few isolatedlittle Indian camps.The boat ties to trees along the banks. No docks or anything of thatnature. Not many mosquitoes yet, more horseflies, which, however, donot bother man very much.After reaching Hot Springs (right bank), there is seen a long range ofmore or less forested, fairly steep-sloped hills along the right bank,coming right down to the water's edge for miles, with bush and forestedflats opposite. At the end of one of the ravines with a little stream,right on the bank, remnants of a little glacier melting very slowly inthe sun. Strange contrast, ice and green touching. Boat making goodtime along the hills.June 18. Hardly any sleep. Sun set after 10 and rose about 2.30, withno more than dusk between. Then heat in the cabin, and above all thenoises. The boat stuck five hours on a bar and there were all sorts ofjerks and shudders and calls.Flats again on both sides, but hills beyond, with just one little spotof snow. Will be warm day again.ANCIENT MANProspects of old remains of man all along the river are slight ifany. Old silt flats have doubtless been mostly washed away (as now)and rebuilt. Only on the older parts, now often far from water,could anything remain and there it is all a jungle of forest withundergrowth, with all surface traces absent (no stone, no shell), andno one here to find things accidentally. As to the hills that approachthe river, the slopes (shales, overlain by what looks like stratifiedmud and silt rock) are mostly of recent exposure, and have doubtlessbeen receding slowly through erosion, so that the bank line along themis not old; and their valleys are few, narrow, and were higher formerlyas well as more extended toward where the river flowed then. The onlyhopeful spot is about Hot Springs, where fossil animal remains are saidto exist, but here nothing as yet has been noted suggesting ancient man.June 18, 4 p. m. River getting broader. Some low dunes. In distancea range of bluish hills before us--the hills along the Yukon. Boatmeandering from side to side. Every now and then a necessary steamblow-out of mud, or a short whistle, hurry of a man over the top of thebarge and of two half-breeds along its side to the prow to test, withlong pointed and graduated poles, the depth of the water, calling itout to the captain. The calls range from "no bottom" to "4 feet," atthe latter of which the boat begins to touch and back water.5 p. m. Arrived at Tanana, a cheerful looking town, extending overabout half a mile along the right bank of the Yukon, here about 20feet high; but now, with the gold rush over, rather "slack" on bothbusiness and population, as are all other Yukon towns. Somewhatdisappointed with the Yukon--not as majestic here as expected. Seestorekeeper--introduced by captain. Hear good news. The Indians have abig potlatch at the mission, 2 miles above. Tanana Indians expected.And there will be many in attendance. Rumors of this potlatch wereheard before, but this was the first definite information. Get on alittle motor boat with Indians who were making some purchases, and goto the St. Thomas Episcopal Mission, Mr. Fullerton in charge.THE INDIANS AT TANANAThe mission above Tanana is beautifully located on the elevated rightYukon bank, facing Nuklukhayet island and point, the latter, accordingto old reports, an old trading and meeting spot of the Kuchin tribes,and the confluence of the Tanana with the Yukon. The mission house,located on rising ground, the wooden church lower down, the cemetery abit farther up, and the Indian village a bit farther downstream, withtheir colors and that of the luxuriant vegetation, form a picturesquecluster.I am kindly received by Mr. Fullerton and his wife and givenaccommodation in their house. On the part of the good-sized Indianvillage everything is life and bustle and we soon are over. Motorlaunches owned and operated by the Indians in the river; dogs, scoresof the big, half-wild, noisy sled dogs tied to stakes along the slopeof the bank, fighting stray ones, barking in whole outbursts, feedingon smelly fish, or digging cooling holes into the bank in which theyhide most of the body from the warm rays of the sun; and many Indians,about 400 in all, in whole families, in houses, large canvas tents,cooking, eating, visiting--a busy multitude, but with white man'sclothes, utensils, etc., not nearly so interesting as a group of moreprimitive Indians would be.Walk, visit, talk, and observe. Note many mix-bloods, especially amongthe younger ones and the children. Among the full bloods, many, aboutone-half, with features reminding more or less of Eskimoid; but a fewtypically Indian, i. e., like most of the States Indians.Medium stature, substantial but not massive build, quite a few ofthe older women stout. Color of full bloods generally near mediumbrown, features regular Indian but not exaggerated, noses ratherlow especially in upper half, eyes and hair Indian. Epicanthus notexcessive in children, absent in adults (traces in younger women), eyesnot markedly oblique. Behavior, Indian.The more pronounced Eskimoids have flatter and longer faces, moreoblique eyes, and more marked epicanthus. They should come, it wouldseem, from Eskimo admixture. The Tanana Indians (Nenana) did not, sofar as seen, show such physiognomies.Toward evening, and especially after supper, natives sing and dance.Songs of Indian characteristics, and yet different from those in south;some more expressive. A song "for dead mother," very sad, affects someto crying aloud (a woman, a man). A wash song--a row of women and evensome men imitating, standing in a row, the movements in washing, whileothers sing; humorous. A dance in a line, curving to a circle, of amore typical Indian character. Late at night, a war dance, with muchsupple contortion. Also other songs and dances up to 2.30 a. m.--heardin bed.June 19. With dogs barking and whining and Indians singing, got littlerest. All Indians sleep until afternoon. No chance of doing anything,so go down to town to get instruments and blanks. Find that storekeeperhas an old stone ax--sells it to me for $1. Also tells of a farmerwho has one--go there with the boat and obtain it as a gift; told ofanother one--a Finn--has two, sells them for $1. Come from the gravellybank of the river or are dug out in gardening. There may well have beenold settlements in this favorable location. After return, visit sometents to see sick. Much sickness--eyes, tuberculosis--now and thenprobably syphilis.Indians relatively civilized, more than expected, and most speaktolerable English. Have flags, guns, sleep in some cases on iron bedsand under mosquito netting, smoke cigarettes and cigars; and even playfiddles. Of course some have also learned the white man's cupidity andvices.This day I met with something unexpected, due to perversity ofmix-breed nature. Seeing so many Indians present, and after a goodreception by them the evening preceding, I thought of utilizing theoccasion for taking some measurements. I therefore mentioned the thingto some of the head men shortly after my arrival and receiving whatseemed assent, went to-day to Tanana to get my instruments. On comingback and finding a few of the old men, who were quite friendly, Iinvited them into the "kashim" (community house) and began to questionthem on old sites, etc., when in came, probably somewhat under theinfluence of liquor, a mix-breed to whom I had been introduced thenight before and who at that time acted quite civilly, but now comingforward began rather loudly and offensively to question about what Iwanted here and about authority, giving me to understand at last quiteplainly that he wanted to "be paid" if I was to take any measurements.He claimed to be one of the "chiefs," and I would not be allowed todo anything without his help. His harangue quite disturbed the otherIndians, who evidently were both ashamed and afraid of the fellow. Andas I would not be coerced into employing and paying him, and therebeing no one, as I learned, of supreme authority, the "chief" of theseIndians being little more than a figurehead, it was decided to give upthe attempt at measurements. The rest of the visit was therefore givento further observations and to the witnessing of the potlatch. ChiefJoseph (pl. 14), nominally the head of these Yukon Indians, expressedhis sorrow and tried to make amends by offering himself.The potlatch was evidently in the main a social gathering of the YukonIndians, with the Tanana natives as visitors. It consisted mainly ofeating, singing, and dancing, to be terminated by a big "give-away."This latter was witnessed. It proved a disappointing and rathersenseless affair. The whole transaction consists in the buying andgathering, and on this occasion giving away, of all sorts of objects,by some one, or several, who have lost a husband, wife, mother,etc., during the preceding year. The possessions of the deceased areincluded in this and doubtless often transmit disease. All the colorof the observance is now gone. The goods--blankets, clothing, fabrics,guns, and many other objects, even pieces of furniture, trunks, orstoves--are gathered in the open and when the time comes are one afteranother selected by those dispensing and brought to this or that manor woman of those who have gathered around. No song, no ceremony,no talks, no thanking, no "wake" following. Just a poor shadow ofsomething that formerly may have been a tragic, memorable, and meaningoccasion.Returned to Tanana near 10 p. m. and found lodging with a storekeeperwho kept a "hotel." Got a big room, big bed, and when store closed wasalone in the house, the storekeeper sleeping elsewhere.June 20. But, Alaska was evidently not made for sleepers. Had not awink until after 3 a. m.--daylight, people talking loud and walking onthe board walk outside, and heard so clearly in my room--loud-laughinggirls, the dogs, and at last another boat with its siren; and everynow and then a singing mosquito trying to get at me through even thesmall opening left under the sheet for breathing--there being nonetting. Finally doze off, to wake near 9 a. m., but everything closed,deadlike. However, go to a little frame house for breakfast, and inwaiting until it is made find myself with two elderly men who go to-daydown the river with their boats. One is a former store clerk, etc.,and now an "optician"--peddles eyeglasses down the river; the otherwas a prospector, miner, and blacksmith, now an itinerant "jeweler"and a reputed "hootch" peddler. As the latter--otherwise a pretty goodfellow--has a good-sized though old boat, arrange to go down with him.See the marshal, storekeeper, settle with my hotel man (had to go at 11to awake him), and ready to start.The outfit is largely homemade, not imposing, old, unpainted, and unfitfor the rough--but it could be worse. It consists of a scow, a low,flat-bottomed boat, partly covered with canvas roof on birch hoops,in which Peake (the owner) carries fresh meat to some one, a stove,dishes, bedding, and many other things; and the motor boat proper, inwhich there is little room except for the machine and its tender. Thelatter sits on a soap box; I, on a seat extemporized from a cylindricalpiece of firewood with a little board across it, with my two boxesand bedding within easy reach. Sit in front of the scow, except whendriven back by spray. But our motor works and so we start quite wellat some time after 11. The arrangement is to stop at every white man'scamp or settlement down to Ruby. I could have gone on a better boatwith its owner, but they charge here $15 a day, with "keep," and twicethe amount for the return of the man and the boat, which is beyond myresources.Tanana--Ruby. The river is clearer than the Tanana, and much broader.It is a great fine stream and its shores, while mostly still low on theleft, on the right rise here and there into moderate loess bluffs, farbeyond which are seen higher elevations and bluish forested mountains.All covered with poplar and spruce.2.15 p. m. Wind has so increased that the scow bumps and squeaks andthere is danger of opening its seams. Therefore side to the beach andmake lunch--a roast of fat pork, over-salted, canned spinach, drybread, and black coffee. All on a simple, old, but efficient littlestove in the boat. Our companion, the oculist, rides not with us but ina nice little green canoe with a plaything of a gasoline motor fastenedto the backboard, but we all eat and sleep together.But a few small Indian camps seen, and no white man's house. Soon afterlunch, however, approach "The Old Station," where there are a fewIndian houses, and later a white man's place (Burchell's). Stop at thelatter. Learn that we are 20 miles from Tanana and on a 5-mile-longchannel. There are here 15 to 40 feet high loess-like (silt) bluffswith a flat on the top, which latter was from far back one of the mostimportant sites of the Indians of these regions. Mr. Burchell and hispartner kindly take me back, with their better boat, to the main oldsite. Many old graves there, a few still marked. Traces of dugouts(birch-bark lined), houses, caches, etc., from Burchell's place to oldmain site. Important place that deserves to be thoroughly excavated,though this will entail no little work. Site was of the choicest,dominant, healthy. Connects by a trail, still traceable, with theKoyukuk region.There are said to be no traces of pottery in any of these parts. Butaverage to very large stone axes are washed out occasionally from thebanks, and other articles are dug out (long ivory spear, bone scraper,etc.). Promise of bones, etc., by Mr. Burchell.One hundred miles more to Ruby. Near 8 p. m. start again--sun stillhigh, little wind--endeavor to get to the "bone yard," a great bankbearing fossils. Fine clean scenery, flat on left, flat to elevatedwith grey-blue mountainous beyond on right. Water now calm and we makegood progress. Very few camps--dogs on the beach, fish-drying racksa little farther, then a little log cabin and perhaps a tent, withsomewhere near by in the river the inevitable fish wheel, turningslowly with the current.Had supper at Burchell's; white fish, boiled potato, coffee, somecanned greens.Scenery in spots precious, virginal, flat at the river, elevatedbehind, foreground covered by the lighter green of poplars and birches,with upright, somber, dark spruce behind. Sun on the right, half moonon the left, and river like a big glassy lake, just rippling a littlehere and there. Cooler--need a coat. On right, getting gradually nearerthe mountains.Near 10 p. m. Sun still above horizon. On left a long (several miles),mostly wooded, but here and there denuded, palisade-like bank,apparently 200-400 feet high--the "graveyard."Monday, June 21. Just at sunset last night--after 10 o'clock--came tothe "bone yard" bank--a long curving line of loess bluffs 100 to 300feet high, steep right to water's edge, riven by many ravines. Lowestthird (approximately) light compact loess; then a thick layer of riversand (stratified more or less) and small gravel, then from one-third tonearly two-fifths of darker loess. In spots quite dark, frozen, but onsurface melting, "running," also tumbling in smaller or larger masses.Wherever darker there emanates from it and spreads far out over theriver a decided mummy-like smell. Too late to photograph from boat,and no other place available. Also impracticable to explore with anydetail--would take several days and be a difficult work. The bluffsbecome gradually lower downstream. No bones seen from boat, but mostlywere not near enough to discern. A remarkable formation, in many ways,and in need of masterly study as well as description.Night on a low gravelly and pebbly beach. Many mosquitoes. Mosquitonetting found bad--sides too short (gave directions, but they weredisregarded) and mesh not small enough. In a short time impossible tostay under. Supplemented by old netting of Mr. Peake, who will sleepunder his canvas in the boat; but the old dirty net has holes in itand the mosquitoes keep on coming through the two. Fighting them untilsome time after midnight, then under all my things--netting, blanket,clothes--find some rest, sleeping until 4.30 a. m. After that--fullday, of course--sleep impossible. The "optician," who slept well underproper Alaska netting, gets up, wakes my man; we both get up, shake,roll up bedding, have a cat-wash, then breakfast, and at 6.30 off oncemore along the beautiful but not hospitable river.Inquiry at a local white man's cabin about fossils and Indian thingsnegative--has paid no attention, and fossil bones that he sometimescomes across generally not in good state of preservation.Right bank now hilly, with greater hills and then mountains behind.Warm, river smooth, just a light breeze. How puny we are in all thisgreatness.A lot of trouble develops with the engine to-day--bad pump. Will notget to Ruby until evening. Meat, on which I must sit occasionally,begins to smell, and there are numerous horseflies, probably attractedby the smell.Four p. m. Visit Kokrines, on a high bank, native village, cemetery.Photograph some natives, are good natured, talk pidgin English. Clearlyconsiderable old Eskimo admixture, but the substratum and main portionis Indian. All kind and cheerful here, glad to have pictures taken.Only white man is a "road-house" keeper; i. e., storekeeper. Store,however, poorly stocked, probably in all not over $200 worth of goods."Optician," who is hoggish, has headache, but eats and drinks all hecan nevertheless. "Jeweler" repaired his pump, and so we are once moreon the way--35 miles more to Ruby. No trace of any relics at Kokrines.River now a mile wide, with many "slews" (side channels, sloughs), andmany low, flat, forested islands. Mountains to right, higher, tracesof snow. Smoke wall from forest fire advancing from the west--nowalso smell. Islands beautiful, fresh colors and clean--light grass onborder, then green and grayish poplars, birches, and alder, from amongwhich rise the blackish green spruces. Little native fishing camps amile or two apart, right bank--on left wilderness of flats, as usual.A few miles above Ruby conditions change--high bluffs (rocky) nowon left, flat on right side. Ruby, from a distance and after theloneliness of the day, looks quite a little town on the left bank, atthe base of the higher ground.RUBYJune 22-23. Our approach to Ruby was very modest. With Mr. Peake paidoff, we just sided against and tied to the bank, on which are thelowest houses of the village, and carried out my boxes and bedding onthe bank. There two or three men were idly watching our arrival. Iasked about the local marshal, to whom I had a note, and had my thingscarried to the combined post office and hotel. In almost no time I meetMr. Thomas H. Long, the marshal, become acquainted with the peopleabout, tell my mission, and begin to collect. It does not take longfor one properly introduced to be thoroughly and warmly at home inAlaska. The first specimen I get is a fine fossilized mammoth molar. Itis brought to me by Albert Verkinik, who was about to depart for somemines, but went back to get the tooth. And he asks no compensation.The parts of two days spent at Ruby were quite profitable. Visiting,and in the jail, were several Indians who could be noted andphotographed. At the old jail there were two skulls of Indiansthat were donated. The teacher had two of the characteristic Yukontwo-grooved axes. The postmaster, Mr. H. E. Clarke, gave a collectionof fresh animal skulls. Mr. Louis Pilback donated two mammoth molars,found 2 miles up the Yukon on Little Melozey Creek, about 8 feet deep,in the muck right over the gravel. Mrs. Monica Silas brought me agood old stone knife. Several of the men took me down to the beach tosee a damaged fossil elephant skull, also to see some fossiliferousworkings above the town. Another party took me a few miles up andacross the river to see an Indian camp and near by some old burials.The collections were sent through parcel post; and the evening beforedeparture I gave a lecture to an attentive and respectful audience.The town itself, however, is now a mere damaged and crumbling shellof what it was in the heyday of its glory, during the gold rush. Manyof the frame dwellings and stores are empty; the board sidewalks arerickety and with big holes; and in the air is a general lack of impetus.June 23. Failing to find another suitable boat, I once more made anarrangement to go farther down the river with Mr. Peake and his friend.Peake's boat and scow were not much to look at, and the troubles withthe engine, and with its owner's raw swearing at times, were somewhattrying; but for my purpose the outfit did well enough, and I wastreated very well and given all needed opportunity to examine what wasof importance on the banks. I was quite sorry when eventually we had topart company, and I know Mr. Peake has not forgotten my quest, for Iheard of his talking about it to parties, with whom I was very glad tocome in contact, on the Kuskokwim.June 23. The sunny evening of my second busy day at Ruby, near 10p. m., Peake unexpectedly comes to the hotel to tell me he will beready to start to-night, on account of quiet water. His wash "isbeing ironed" and will be ready soon. The marshal comes in, calls theprisoners to take down my baggage, and at 10.15, after true, heartygood-byes, I am once more in the old scow. Then Peake goes for hiswash, with an Indian woman, and does not come until near 11. Riverpeaceful, sun shortly set, sky somewhat cloudy, forest fire on oppositeshore below still smoking a great deal. Leaving good people at Ruby,who promise to help in the future. It is getting much cooler after apretty warm day. Will lie on the hard boxes and try to get a littlesleep.Thursday, June 24. We went long into the night, then stopped at a lonecabin. Up timely, but slow start--it is 10.10 a. m. before we go.The time gained at night lost now--bad habits. Breeze up the river,occasionally strong, but not severe.The cabin was the "Dutchman's," or Meyer's. He came out at 1 a. m. tomeet us, at the bark of his big dogs, a good-hearted, weather-searedprospector, fisherman, and trapper of about 40, alone with his huskies.Asked me into his little log hut, prepared a place for my bedding ona frame, burned powder against the mosquitoes, brought out from cool"cellar" a bottle of root beer he brews, and then we went to sleep. Butdogs kept waking us and Meyer went out several times to quiet them.Fall asleep at 3.20 and oblivious until near 7. Meyer forces on me sixbottles of root beer, I leave him some prescriptions, and taking my bedroll we go down to the boat. My men still sleeping, as I expected. Andthen slow awakening, breakfast, and late starting.Meyer never saw any Indian bones or stones, but promises cheerfully towatch for them hereafter and to make inquiries. Of course, he also,like so many in these lands, tells of a "prospect" of a gold find, andis quite confident he'll "make good." As usual, also, it is a "lead"that was "lost" and he believes he has found it. And all the time thegold is inside, not outside, of these hunters of the yellow star.Hills on the right again; flat islands, banks, etc., on the left.Meyer's is 18 miles down from Ruby, right bank. About 5 miles fartherdown on the slopes of the right bank is a pretty little Indiangraveyard (pl. 1, _b_), and a little lower down there are three nowempty Indian huts.Hills and mountains seen also now beyond the wide flats of the leftbank. The hills on right, along which we pass, are more or lessforested, but often just bushy and grassy. They rise to about 600 to700 feet and the slopes are seldom steep. Along their base there aremany elevated platforms, low swells, and nooks, that could have servedof old--as they serve here and there now--for native habitation, thoughonly few could have accommodated larger villages.Pass an Indian camp--the inevitable staked dogs; a swimming boy--firstbeing seen bathing in the open.Whiskey Creek next. Sixty-two dogs, all along the bank, and eachone-half or more in his own cooling hole; holes they dig down to nearthe frozen ground. A settler, and two Indians--a photograph. No relicsor bones now, but will watch; promise also to save some animal skulls,etc.Twelve o'clock. Off again. Day better now, less squally, warm.Hills above and below lower and earthy--loess, at least much of it. Theright shore is all along sunnier, higher, more beautiful, and more opento wind (less mosquitoes). These are the reasons, doubtless, why it wasof old and is still the favored side for habitations by natives as wellas whites.Just before reaching "Old Lowden," overtaken by a rather crazily drivensmall motor boat with four young Indians, who hand us a crude messagefor the storekeeper at Galena, telling him that a baby in the campis to die to-night. I offer to see the baby. Find a boy infant aboutone year or a little over, ill evidently with bronchitis. Father andmother, each about 30, sit over it brooding in dumb grief, each on oneside. Respond not to my presence, and barely so to my questions. Andwhen I begin to tell to the fellow who interprets and is some relativethat the baby need not die, and what to do--I note that he is somewhatunder the influence of liquor and a little flushed--to my dismay hebegins to rant against me as a doctor and against the Government, andwants me perforce, seemingly, to say that the child is going to dieand die to-night. There are two guns around and I almost anticipatehis catching hold of one. The gist of the piecemeal talk is that theybelieve I am a Government doctor, who ought to stay four or five dayswith them and take over the child's treatment, and yet the fellowinsists that the child will die before next morning. I do not know whatthey would say or do to the doctor if he undertook to stay and thechild died--or if it recovered. It is dismal. They have the idea thatthe "Government" is obliged to do all sorts of things for them, withoutbeing clear just what, and that it does not do them. They believe,and try to say so, that I am sent and paid by the Government to treatthem. Probably they have heard about the Government medical party thatis to examine conditions along the river this summer, and think that Ido not want to do or give what is necessary. I give all the possibleadvice, but there is plainly no inclination to follow it. I offer somemedicine; they sneer at medicine. Even the father says he does notunderstand it or want it. They are all surly and in a dangerous, stupidmood. So there is nothing left but to go away as well as one may.On way down the bank a woman is seen cleaning and cutting fish--knifesteel, with wood or ivory handle, of the Chinese and Eskimo type. Aporcupine, bloated, and with flies and maggots on it already aboutthe nose, mouth, and eyes, lies next to the woman, and its turn willprobably come next after the fish.Have modest lunch--canned pears, a bit of cold bacon left from morning,a bit of cheese, and coffee; and start once more onward. So much beautyhere, and such human discord.3.30 p. m. Passing on right bank a line of bluffs, wholly of loess,about 200 feet high and approximately 4 miles long, and as if shavenwith knife from top to water's edge. After that flats only on bothsides, with but one hill far ahead of us.Motor trouble again--same old pump; but not for long; in half an houron again. A steamer upward passes us--like a stranger, and power.GALENAA little town (village), on a flat promontory. An old consumptivestorekeeper--no knowledge of any old implements or skeletal remains.Lowden village moved here due to mine opposite and better site. About10 Indian houses here; inhabitants now mostly in fishing camps.From Galena down, low shores and islands as on the Tanana, as far ascan be seen, with mountains, grayish blue, in far distance (and onlyoccasional glimpses). River never less than three-fourths of a mile andsometimes together with its sloughs and islands several miles broad.Some geese; occasional rabbit seen on land; otherwise but little life.First gulls.The Indians at Ruby and Galena show here and there an Eskimoid type,with the younger nearly all mix bloods (with whites). Full bloods ofsame type as all along the river, brachycephalic, low to moderatehigh vault of head, moderate to medium (rarely above) stature, mediumbrown, noses not prominent, concavo-convex, moderately convex ornearly straight, Indian cast of the face, but quite a few more or lessEskimoid. Not very bright.Sit in the bottom of the scow, in front, before the stove and makenotes. When we stop, jump out to tie the boat; when leaving, push itoff. Getting sunburnt dark. Forgetting once again that I have a stomachor any other organ. Only sleep, never fully, much less than ought to;but even that is somehow much more bearable here than it would be athome.6.45 p. m. Suddenly, after a turn, confronted with a steep rockypromontory about 500 feet high--stratified mud rocks. On side, highabove, a tall white cross; learn later an Indian murdered a bishophere. A little farther, on a flat below the slope, a small settlement.A remarkable landmark, known as the Bishop's Rock. Afterwards againflats, but some more elevated than before to the left. River like agreat looking-glass. Same character of vegetation and colors as fartherabove, but details varied.At Ruby had made a genuine, effective, Alaska mosquito netting, andso now feel quite independent of the pest; also have two bottles ofmosquito oil, which helps. Fortunately on the water we are not bothered.Toward night reach Koyukuk River, and later on, Koyukuk village, apleasant row of houses, white and native, on a high bank. Here, atlast, pass one good night, sleeping under good mosquito netting in thehouse and on the bed of an Italian trader. Also had good supper ofsalmon, and good breakfast of bacon and eggs, and so feel rested andstrong.Friday, June 25. But in the morning the sky is overcast and every nowand then there is a loose shower. Of course my boon companions arenot ready again until long after 9 o'clock, and then the engine willnot go again, so a longer delay. They were inclined, in fact, to "layover," but I urged them on. But they are determined if it rains a bitmore to "tie to" somewhere. Fortunately there is no wind. About 3 milesbelow Koyukuk and its flats, the high bluffs with steep more or lessshaved-like barren slopes recommence. A gloomy day.About 7 miles down, after a large rocky promontory, a small graveyardon the side of a hill, with a little native camp about a third of amile beyond.10.45 a. m. Beautiful wooded great hills, 400 to 800 feet high, allalong the right bank again, with large ~V~-shaped valleys between. Afine, rounded, slightly more than usually elevated island ahead. Leftbanks flat.Sun coming out a little; cool, but not unpleasant. No more showers,river smooth, boat making time. Blue hazy mountains far to the leftfront.Hills to right rocky, strata horizontal to warped, mud rocks, broadbanks of sandy, gravelly or mucky materials, not consolidated, betweenhard strata.Now and then a small Indian camp, usually two or three tents, Indians,dogs, boats; some drying fish (not much).11.00 a. m. Another isolated little graveyard, right slope, near an oldcamp.There is no possibility now of excavating any of these graveyards,for the Indians are in unpleasant disposition toward the Governmentfor various reasons. But such a place as that near Burchell's couldbe excavated as soon as conditions improve. Also that above Rubyand another opposite and just below Ruby. There are no longer anysuperstructures left at these (or but traces), and the graves, as seenabove Ruby, are near (within 2 feet of) the surface.No trace or indication of anything older than the double-grooved axculture has thus far been seen anywhere in the valley; and largestretches of present banks are quite barren.As we approach Nulato the horizon before us becomes hilly andmountainous. The sun is now fully out and its warmth is very pleasant.Pass an Indian woman paddling a canoe; later an Indian family goingupstream in a motor boat. Most of these Indians possess a motor boat ofsome sort, and know how to run it, though it is not in their nature tobe overcareful.NULATO(Pl. 1, _b_)Arrive midday. Quite a village, as usual along the water front on ahigh bank. Large fancy modern surface burial ground with brightlypainted boxes and flying flags on a hill to the right. Met by localmarshal and doctor; my things are taken to a little hospital. Nativeshere have poor reputation, but now said to be better. Boys nearly allmix bloods. Several men and women show Eskimo type, but majorityare Indian to somewhat Eskimoid. Soon find they are not very welldisposed--want pay for everything, and much pay. Have a few specimens,but to obtain anything from them is difficult. Have been spoiled.A visit with the marshal to the site of old Nulato on the proximatepoint; nothing there, just a rabbit's skull and a lot of mosquitoes.Photograph old graveyard (that of old Nulato), on the distal pointbeyond the creek.Mr. Steinhauser, trader, of Czech descent, helpful and kind. Butnothing further to do here. Steamer that was to be here to-nightor to-morrow will not arrive, just learned, until Tuesday (this isFriday); and so must engage a little gasoline boat to the next station,Kaltag, 40 miles down the river.Sleep under my new netting in the hospital. In the morning, afterparting with doctor and marshal, start 8.30 a. m. Boat little, shaky,run by a half-breed boy of about 18. My old scow with Peake and hiscompanion will stay a day longer. Partly cloudy, warm.Pass flats, and come again to similar shaved-off bluffs like yesterday.We are now running close to the shore so that I can see everything.Flowers, but not many or many varieties.9.50 a. m. Pass (about 8 miles from Nulato) a few burials (old boxes)on right slope. (Pl. 1, _c_.) Indian camp about one-half mile farther,and a few old abandoned huts and caches.Everything on and along the river about the same as yesterday, exceptin little details. Sky clouded; light clouds, however. The boy with mehas had good schooling (for a native) and is a good informer. But thereis little of archeological or anthropological interest hereabouts. (Pl.2, _a_.)12.10 p. m. Another rounded island ahead of us; far beyond itgrayish-blue hills and mountains. Six miles more to Kaltag. But littlelife here--a few small birds, a lone robin, a lone gull.KALTAG1.00 p. m. Kaltag in view--a small modern village on right bank, lessthan half the size of Nulato; a nearly compact row of log and plankhouses. Nothing of any special interest seen from distance, and butlittle after landing. The old village used to be somewhat higher up theriver.There is an old abandoned site also just opposite the present Kaltag.Another site, "Klenkakaiuh," is, I am told, in the Kaiuh slough southof Kaltag, in a straight line about 10 miles, but no one there; andseveral other old villages in that region along that slough--sameIndians as those of Kaltag. All of Kaltag go there on occasions, but donot live there permanently any more.[Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 1_a_, "Old Minto" on the Tanana.

H., 1926)]At Kaltag Eskimoid features already predominate and some of those seenare fully like Eskimo.There is a tradition of an Asiatic (Chukchee) attempt at Kaltag once.Later in the afternoon photograph some natives and go with Mr. Müller,the storekeeper, and Mr. McLeod, the intelligent local teacher, on thelatter's boat, "hunting" along the banks up the stream. Meet an oldIndian (Eskimo type) paddling a birch-bark canoe, said to be the onlycanoe of that sort now on the Yukon. About three-fourths of a mileabove the village see caved bank and find a skull and bones--"split"old burial of a woman.A canoe coming, so we all go farther up the beach, pretending toexamine stones. It is only the boy who brought me, however, going homewith some planks, and he grins knowingly.After that we locate three exposed coffins, two undisturbed and coveredwith sod. These two, for fear of irritating the natives, are left.But the third is wrapped only in birch bark. It was a powerful woman.With her a bone tool and a white man's spoon. With the burial that hadtumbled out of the bank there were large blue and gray beads and threeiron bracelets--reserved by the teacher.I gather all the larger bones and we put them temporarily in a pieceof canvas. It is hard to collect all--the men are apprehensive--itmight be dangerous for them if detected. Everything smoothed as much aspossible, and we go across the river to examine two fish nets belongingto the trader. One of these is found empty; but the other containsfive large king salmon, 15 to 20 pounds each, three drowned, twostill alive. The latter are hooked, hoisted to the edge of the boat,killed with a club, and, full of blood, thrown into the boat--great,stout, fine fish. To secrete our other findings from the natives thestorekeeper gets a large bundle of grass and ties it to my package. Weshall be bringing "medicine."Arrive home, only to learn that against our information the riverboat has left Tanana on schedule time, is now above Koyukuk, and isexpected to arrive at Kaltag before 8 p. m. Hurriedly pack, a few morephotographs, supper, and the smoke of the steamer begins to be visible.In a little while she is at the bank, my boxes are brought down, agreeting with old friends on the boat--the same boat (_Jacobs_) onwhich I went from Nenana to Tanana--and we start off for Anvik.Mr. Müller, the trader at Kaltag, German by birth, has a young, fairlyeducated Eskimo wife, a good cook, housekeeper, and mother of onechild. The child is an interesting white-Eskimo blend.In his store Mr. Müller showed me a good-sized heavy bowl of red stonewith a figure seated in a characteristic way near one end. The specimenwas said to have come from an old site on the Kaiuh and is of thesame type as that at the museum in Juneau and the two in the east, oneat the Museum of the American Indian, New York, and the other at theUniversity Museum, Philadelphia. Regrettably Mr. Müller would not partwith the specimen. (See also p. 34.)The natives of Kaltag, so far as seen, are more Eskimoid than those ofany of the other settlements farther up the river.Fine evening; sit with a passenger going to Nome, until late. Learnthat the boat to St. Michael is waiting for this boat and will go righton--not suitable for my work. Also we are to stop but a few minutes atAnvik, where I am to meet Doctor Chapman, the missionary.Sunday, June 27. About 5 a. m. arrive in the pretty cove of Anvik.Received on the bank by Doctor Chapman, the head of the localEpiscopalian mission and school, and also the Anvik postmaster. Thedoctor for the present is alone, his wife and daughter having goneto Fairbanks, and so he is also the cook and everything. In a fewminutes, with the help of some native boys, I am with my boxes inDoctor Chapman's house, and after the boat has left and the necessitiesconnected with what she left attended to we have breakfast. I amsoon made to feel as much as possible "at home," and we have a longconversation. Then see a number of chronic patients and incurables;attend a bit lengthy service in Doctor Chapman's near-by little church;have a lunch with the ladies at the school; visit the hill graveyard.They have reburied all the older remains and there is nothing left.Attend an afternoon service and give a talk to the congregation ofabout half a dozen whites and two dozen more or less Eskimoid Indianson the Indians and our endeavors; and then do some writing, ending theday by going out for about a mile and a half along the banks of theAnvik River, looking in vain for signs of something older, human oranimal. (Pl. 2, _c_.)There are many and bad gnats here just now--how bad I only learnedlater, when I found my whole body covered with patches of their bites;and also many mosquitoes, which proved particularly obnoxious duringthe lunch. As the doctor is alone, the three excellent white ladies ofthe school, matron and teachers, invited us, as already mentioned, tolunch with them. We had vegetable soup, a bit of cheese, two crackerseach, a piece of cake, and tea. But I chose an outlandish chair theseat of which was made of strips of hide with spaces between; and fromthe beginning of the lunch to its end there was a struggle between theproprieties of the occasion and the mosquitoes that kept on biting methrough the spaces in the seat. Chairs of this type, and I finally toldthat to the ladies to explain my seeming restlessness during the meal,should be outlawed in Alaska.THE ANVIK PEOPLEThe Anvik people, it will be recalled, were the first Yukon nativesseen by a white man. They were discovered in 1834 by Glazunof, andsince then have occupied the same site, located favorably on a pointbetween the Anvik and the Yukon Rivers. They belonged to the Inkaliktribe, a name given to them, according to Zagoskin, by the coastpeople and signifying "lousy," from the fact that they never cut theirhair, which in consequence, presumably, harbored some parasites. Theirvillage was the lowest larger settlement of the Indians on the Yukon,the Eskimo commencing soon after.The Anviks to-day are clearly seen to be a hybrid lot. There areunmistakable signs of a prevalent old Eskimo mixture. The men arenearly all more or less Eskimoid, and even the head is not infrequentlynarrower, fairly long, jaws much developed. The women, however, showthe Eskimo type less, and the children in a still smaller measure--theyare much more Indian. Yet even some women and an occasional childare Eskimoid--face flat, long, lower jaw high, cheek bones prominentforward (like welts on each side of the nose), whole physiognomyrecalling the Eskimo. The more Indianlike types resemble closely thoseof the upper Yukon. There is perceptible, too, some mixture withwhites, particularly in the young.To bed about 11. Attic warm and window can not be opened because of theinsects. Sleep not very good; some mosquitoes in room anyway. Wake upafter 3 and just begin to doze off again when the doctor gets up. About4 he puts his shoes on--one can hear every sound throughout the framehouse, even every yawn--and then goes to the kitchen where there sooncomes the rattling of pots. At 4.30 comes up to bid me good morning andask me if I am ready to get up and have breakfast. A man with a boat isto be ready at 6 to take me to some old site. So a little after 5 I getup, shave, dress and go down. Another night to make up for sometime,somewhere.We finish breakfast and the doctor goes to look for the man, buteverything deadlike, no one stirring anywhere. So I pack my stonespecimens from the river above and the bones from Kaltag, etc. It is8 a. m. and then at last Harry Lawrence, our man, appears--havingunderstood to come about that time--and before long we start, in agood-sized boat, up the Yukon.Day mostly cloudy but fairly good; no wind. Must use mosquito mixtureall the time, even after I get on boat, but they quit later. Amstanding on the back of the boat against and over the "house" overit--inside things shake too much and I can not see enough.Passing by fish wheels--heaps of fish in their boxes--some just beingcaught and dumped in. Picturesque bluffs passed yesterday seen tobe of volcanic stone, near basalt, not granite, with indication ofminerals. Passing close to vertical cliffs of fissured and fragmentedrocks 200 to 500 feet high--dangerous. Consolidated volcanic ashes withinclosure of many bowlders--fine lessons in geology. Slides of soiland vegetation here and there. Large spruces and altogether a richervegetation since this particular rock region was reached. There wasin fact a plain line of demarcation in the vegetation where the rockschanged.Sleepy. Afraid to doze and fall off, so go inside. But there the motorthumps and shakes too much for a nap to be possible.About 12 miles upstream from Anvik, on the north bank, the mineralizedrocks and tufa suddenly cease, to be superseded by a line, severalmiles long, of sheared-off loess bluffs about 200 feet high. Here thevegetation changes very perceptibly. Two mammoth jaws obtained fromthese deposits have a few years ago been given to Mr. Gilmore, of theUnited States National Museum.22 to 23 miles up the river, north bank, a fine large platform and anold native site. Many signs still of pit and tunnel houses. A littlefarther upstream a hill with abandoned burials. Excavate a grave on apromontory over the river--not very old--wet and not much left of softparts, but succeed in getting the skeleton. Fine middle-aged adult,somewhat Eskimoid, about typical for this region. Carry down in a bag,dry on the beach gravel. Lunch on beach; cheese, bread, coffee. Thesite is known as that of the Greyling River. (Pl. 2, _b_.)Start back a little after 3. Very warm day. River smooth. Sky lookslike there might be a storm later.Hear of pottery--40 years ago it was still made at Anvik. Was black,of poor quality. The women used to put feathers in the clay "tomake the pots stronger." When buried it soon rotted and fell topieces. In shapes and otherwise it was much like the Eskimo pottery.Its decorations consisted of nail or other impressions, in simplegeometrical designs, particularly about the rim. It was rather gross,but better pieces did occur, though rarely.It is becoming plain that there are no known traces of any really oldsettlements along the present banks of the Yukon; nothing beyond a fewhundred years at most. If there was anything older no external signs ofit have been noted, and no objects of it have ever been found. It seemscertain that the stone implements thus far seen were used and made bythe pre-Russian and probably even later Indians. They all belong to thepolished-stone variety. No "paleolithic" type of instrument has yetbeen seen.It is also evident that the Eskimo admixture and doubtless alsocultural influence extended far up the river. The farther downthe river, particularly from Ruby, the more the Eskimoid physicalcharacteristics become marked and the Indian diluted, until at Anvikmost, or at least much, physical and cultural, is clearly Eskimo.Have further learned quite definitely that native villages on theYukon were seldom if ever stable. Have been known (as at Kaltag andelsewhere) to have changed location as much as three times within thelast few scores of years, though in general they keep to the samelocality in a larger sense of the word. Anvik alone seems to haveremained on the old site since the advent of the whites.Anvik, Tuesday, June 29. Last night gave talk on evolution to whiteteachers, etc. Quite appreciated, regardless of previous state ofmentality.Caught up with some sleep, even though my attic room was so hot thatthe gum from the spruce boards was dropping down on me. Good breakfastwith the doctor--canned grapefruit, corn flakes with canned milk, breadtoasted in the oven, and coffee.Pack up my Greyling skeleton--much drier to-day--and dispatch by parcelpost, through the doctor as postmaster.Photograph school children and village. Gnats bad and have to wearsubstantial underclothing (limbs are already full of dark red itchingblotches where bitten by them) though it is a hot day again.The full-blood and especially the slightly mixed children would befine, not seldom lovely, were they fully healthy; but their lungs areoften weak or there is some other tubercular trouble.The color of the full-bloods, juvenile and others, on the body, isinvariably submedium to near medium brown, the exposed parts darker;and the chest test (mine) for full-bloodedness holds true. The youngare often good looking; the old rather ugly.All adults fishing now, the fish running much since a day or two; allbusy at the fish camps, not many, in the daytime especially, about themission.At noon air fills with haze--soon recognized as smoke from a fire whichis located at only about a mile, and that with the wind, from themission. We all hasten to some of the houses in the brush--find enoughclearing about them for safety. The school here burned two years agoand so all are apprehensive. Natives from across the river hasten totheir caches. Luckily not much wind.After lunch children come running in saying they hear thunder; one girlsaying in their usual choppy, picturesque way, "Outside is thunder";another smaller one says, "It hollers above." Before long a sprinkleand then gradually more and more rain until there is a downpourfollowed by several thunderclaps (as with us) and then some more rain.That, of course, stops the fire from approaching closer and all issafe. Such storms are rare occurrences hereabouts.My limbs are a sight from the gnats. Must apply Aseptinol. Worse thanany mosquitoes; like the worst chiggers. Poisonous--some hemolyticsubstance, which causes also much itching, especially at night.Arrange to leave to-morrow. Good people these, unpretentious, but whitethrough and through.Mr. Lawrence, the local trader, who with his boy was with me yesterday,is going to take me to an old site down the river and then to HolyCross. Donates a fine old ivory arrow point from the site mentioned.Doctor Chapman gives three old dishes and two stone axes--haft on oneof recent manufacture. The natives seem to have nothing of this nature,and no old site is near. The nearest is Bonasila, where we go to-morrow.This is truly a fish country. Along the placid Anvik River fish smelleverywhere--dead fish on shore here and there, or fish eggs, or offal.Wednesday, June 30. Hazy and cool, 52° F. Take leave with friend,Doctor Chapman, then at school, and leave 8 a. m. for Bonasila.The gnat pest was bad this morning--could hardly load my baggage; hadto apply the smear again, but this helps only where put and for a timeonly.BONASILAClose to 10 a. m. arrive at the Bonasila site. Not much--just a lowbank of the big river, not over 4 feet high in front, and a higher rankgrass-covered flat with a little stream on the left and a hill on theright. But the flat is full of fossae of old barabras (pit and tunneldwellings), all wood on surface gone; and there is a cemetery to theright and behind, on a slope.Examine beach and banks minutely until 12. Modest lunch--twosandwiches, a bit of cake and tea--and then begin to examine theshore again. Soon after arrival finding bones of animals, some partlyfossilized; beaver, deer, caribou, bear, fox, dog, etc., all speciesstill living in Alaska, as found later, though no more in the immediateneighborhood.Mosquitoes and gnats bad--use lot of oil. Begin soon to find remarkablyprimitive looking stone tools, knockers, scrapers, etc. Crawl throughwashed-down trees and brush. Many stones on the beach show signs ofchipping or use. Very crude--a protolithic industry; but a few piecesbetter and showing polished edge. Also plenty of fragments of pottery,not seldom decorated (indented). Make quite a collection. And then, tocap it, find parts of human skeleton, doubtless washed out from thebank. Much missing, but a good bit recovered, and that bit is verystriking. (See p. 156.) Also a cut bone (clean cut, as if by a sharpknife) in situ in the mud of the bank, and a little birch-bark basketstill filled with mud from the bank, with later a larger basket of samenature in situ; could save but a piece. Conditions puzzling. Was therean older site under one more recent?2 p. m. About 2 p. m. go to the cemetery. About a dozen burialsrecognizable. A pest of mosquitoes and gnats--Lawrence soon bleeds overface and neck, while I keep them off only by frequent smearing. Hesoon has to smear, too. Open five graves--placed above ground, wooden(split and no nails) boxes covered with earth and sod. Skeletons allin contracted position, head to the east and lying on right side. Somein poor condition. Three women, one man, one child. Gnats swarm in themoss and the graves, and with the smears, here and there a trickle ofblood, the killed pests and the dust, we soon look lovely. But thereis enough of interest. With each burial appears something--with theman two large blue Russian beads; first woman--a pottery lamp (ordish), iron knife; with the second two fire sticks, stone objects(sharpeners), partly decayed clay dish; with the third, a Russian beadand a birch-bark snuffbox; with the child a "killed" (?) glass bottleof old form and an iron flask; in the grave of an infant (bones gone) aRussian bead. A grave of a child--bones burned.6.15 p. m. Rest must be left. Lawrence may be enabled to do some workin the fall. Leave 6.15; carry quite a lot--in sacks, gasoline cans,lard cans. Wonder how I shall be able to send things from Holy Cross,and what next. Cool, sky overcast whole day.HOLY CROSSThursday, July 1. Slept on the floor of a little store last nightat Ghost Creek. The Catholic mission at Holy Cross, with all sortsof room, about 1½ miles down, and where, though late and tired, Ivisited Father Jules Jetté, a renowned student of the dialects of theYukon Indians, did not offer to accommodate me, and the trader intheir village could only offer me a "bunk" in one little room withthree other people. So after 10 p. m. we went down to the "GhostCreek," where I was gladly given a little corner in the store of AlecRichardson. Of course there were whining dogs outside, right nextto the store on both sides, and they sang at times (or howled) likewolves, whose blood they seem to carry. And a cat got closed in withme and was pulling dried fish about, which she chewed, most of thenight it seemed. So there was not much sleep until from about 5 a. m.to 8.30, after the cat was chased out and the dogs got weary. Then nobreakfast till near 9.30.Went to mission again to see Father Jetté--he is not of the mission--afine old Frenchman and scholar. He was not responsible for last nightand anyway I was spoiled farther up the river. His meritorious workdeserves to be known and published.After a very simple lunch packed yesterday's collections from theBonasila site--five boxes. The parcel post here alone will cost $20.40.How odd that the transportation of the collections of a Governmentinstitution must be paid for from the little appropriation received forscientific work to another department of the same Government.It is cloudy, drizzly, cold. Am endeavoring to leave to-morrow, butthey want $35 to the next station, and the boat does not leave forSt. Michael until the 11th. Fortunately I am able to send away thecollections, and there will surely be some way down the river.GHOST CREEKJuly 1-2, 10.30 p. m. A night on the Yukon. (Pl. 3, _a_,) They havelit a powder against the mosquitoes. Smear the many gnat bites withMentholatum--helps but for a while--and having now my fine meshednetting, my own bedding, and a clean pillow, I feel fine, safe from allthe pests, and ready for a quiet night, all alone.Commenced dozing off when a he-cat, who hid in the store at closing,begins to make all kinds of unnamable noises. Stand it for a while, buthe does not stop and one could never sleep--so crawl out from the bed,catch the beast, and throw him out.In again and settling down, when another cat--did not know there weretwo here--begins to mew and tries to force its way out under the door,which is about 2½ inches above the floor. Persists until I have to getup the second time. Throw that cat out and in bed once more.In a minute, however, the dogs outside espied the cats and began apandemonium of howls and yelps and barks. Try hard, but can not standit. Moreover, the last cat got on the roof, where I hear him walking,and he seems in no hurry to get off. So finally have to get out, catchthe cat on the edge of the roof, throw him back into the store, andto bed for another trial. But soon have to smear the body; the bitesitch too much. The sleepiness is now quite gone. A mild amusementas to what next. It must be midnight or later now, and it has growncold. One blanket is not sufficient. Doze off a little, wake up withcold, readjust blanket and flaps of bag, doze off a little again--thedogs commence to howl, just for a song this time, in two, three, thena unison. The bites itch bitterly, now here, now there. The sun hasrisen; it is real cold, probably no more than about 40° to 45° F. Andso on until 5.30, when at last fall into a deep, dreamless sleep,regardless of light, cats, dogs, and everything and sleep until 8.30.Wake up, can not believe my watch; but it goes, and so probably isright. But no one anywhere yet stirring.Dress, wash a bit in the muddy river; head feels as if it had beenknocked by something heavy. Make my "roll" of bedding and then workon notes, putting down faithfully what has transpired. About 9.30, atlast, the storekeeper comes to say they overslept and that a cup ofcoffee will be ready before long.Friday, July 2. "Ghost Creek" was named so because of many burialsabout the creek. The flat between the hills here is about three-fourthsof a mile long by the water front, with rising slopes, and used toextend considerably farther out, but was "cut" or washed away by theriver. It has been used for a village site and burial ground by the oldIndians of the vicinity. As the banks tumble away, bone arrow points,barbed and not, stone scrapers, and other objects wash out. Graves arefound in the ground as well as above it. Russian influence prevalentin the objects buried with the bodies, but site extends to pre-Russiantime. Same type graves as at Bonasila, with slight local modifications.At Bonasila the burials above ground were in boxes of hewn wood,joined somewhat as the logs in a log house, and without any base. Thebody inside was covered with birch bark (three or four pieces), thencovered with the top planks, unfastened, and these in turn coveredwith about a foot of earth and sod. At Ghost Creek the same, but thereis an undressed-stake base or platform on which the sides of the"coffin" rest and with somewhat less earth and sod on the top of thebox. But graves differ here from underground and birch bark alone (notrace of wood, if any was ever there; but probably none used) to suchaboveground as have iron nails and sawed planks. Here, as at Bonasila,a few simple articles are generally found buried at the head, andfor these many of the graves were already despoiled and the skeletalremains scattered or reburied.There appears to be no line of demarcation between the underground andaboveground graves; possibly the latter were winter burials, but thismust be looked into further.The bodies here, except the latest, are buried flexed. Exceptionally,both at Bonasila and here, the planks surrounding the grave werepainted with some mineral pigments which resist decomposition betterthan the wood, and decorated in a very good native way with seriesof animals and men, caribou, bear, etc. Too faint to photograph, andtoo bulky and decayed to take away; but decoration much superior toordinary Indian pictographs, and apparently connecting with the typeof art of the northwest coast. It is of interest that practically thesame decorated burials were seen by Dall among the Eskimo of NortonSound (Unalaklik).[4] In this case it was probably the Indian habitthat was adopted by the near-by Eskimo, for none of the more northernEskimo practiced such burials. The habit was also known in southeasternAlaska. (Pl. 3, _b_.)Jim Walker, the helpful local mix-breed trader, has dug out many ofthese graves (alone or with Harry Lawrence), and a good many of theobjects are said to have been taken away by Father O'Hara, formerly ofthe Holy Cross Mission.According to all indications the stone culture of Bonasila and of GhostCreek (1½ miles upstream from Holy Cross) were related, both passingapparently into the Russian period, and that at Ghost Creek continuingdown to our times, for there is still living here an old man whobelongs to this place which once had a large village. Much could bedone yet and saved in both places.Saturday, July 3. At last slept, notwithstanding everything, andsucceeded even in being warm.Breakfast 8.30, for a wonder. Two soft-boiled Seattle eggs, two bitsof toast with canned butter (not bad at all), some over-preservedraspberries, and a faded-looking nearly cold "flapjack" with sirup,also mediocre tea. But all goes here, and the stomach calls for noother attention than to fill it.Finishing work, getting further information from the old Indian,writing, and waiting to go away with a trader to Paimute, thefirst all-Eskimo village, 25 miles farther down the river. Rainsoccasionally, but not very cold. Many gnats when wind moderates.Lunch--canned sardines (in this land of fresh salmon!), a bit of toast,some canned fruit, and that unsavory tea.Have utilized this day in a profitable manner. Have learned that therewas another burial ground about half a mile farther upstream, behindan elevation. So got a rowboat and with Jim Walker's young boy rowedover. Had to wade through high grass over a wet flat, and then up therank grass and bush-covered slope, and there found a number of oldburials. All rifled, but most of the bones still there. So send boyback, on the quiet--there is above the store the camp of the old manwith an old Indian woman and sick girl--for some boxes, and meanwhilecollect. It is an unceasing struggle with the mosquitoes and gnats inthe tall grass and weeds; but one after another I find what remains ofthe usual old box burials. The bones are mostly in good condition.The boy arrives with several empty gasoline boxes, we gather driergrass and moss, and pack right on the spot, eventually get to the boat,strike off as far as possible from the shore so none could see what iscarried, and proceed to Walker's storehouse. Old Indian and his oldcrony nevertheless stand on bank and look long at us. In storehouseboxes closed, later delivered by the boy to the mail boat, and so thatmuch is saved; for were it not collected, in a few years the weather,vegetation, and animals, human and other, would destroy everything.[Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 3_a_, Midnight on the Yukon_b_, Lower middle Yukon: Painted burial box of a Yukon Indian (before1884) said to have been a hunter of Bielugas (white whales), which usedto ascend far up the Yukon][Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 4_a_, Eskimo camp below Paimute, Yukon River_b_, Old "protolithic" site 12 miles down from Paimute, right bank,just beyond "12-mile hill." (skull, bones, stones)_c_, "Old" site in bank seen in middle of picture, 12 miles down fromPaimute, opposite that shown in preceding figure. (A. H., 1926)]Moreover, the utmost care is taken always to leave everything in asgood shape as found; and the remains taken will be treated so well andmay give us so much that we need that there is no more hesitation insecuring them than there would be on the part of a paleontologist insecuring old bones for his purposes.For supper, though it is still early, am invited by Simel, an elderlyJew mail carrier. Have fine meat-and-potato soup, lettuce-and-cucumbersalad (even if the cucumbers from the Holy Cross hothouse are overripeand bitter), fresh (storage) meat, cooked dried apples, and poorbut hot coffee--all seasoned with the best will and genuine, simplefriendliness.Max Simel, whose home is at Ophir, has been in this country 29 years,and "never needed to buy a quarter's worth of medicine." Has a wife inSeattle, also a daughter and a son; has not seen them for four years.Wants me to call on them and tell them I met him. With his companion,Paul Keating, of Holikachakat, gives me some interesting information.They tell me independently and then together of an occurrence thatshows what may happen along this great river. A well-known white manand woman, prospectors on their mail route, have last year thawed anddug out a shaft, nearly 40 feet deep, through muck and silt, to thegravel, in which they hoped to get gold; and just before they reachedthe gravel they found a piece of calico, old and in bad condition, butstill showing some of its design and color.7 p. m. It rains, but wind has moderated, and so near 7 p. m. we starton our way farther down the river, stopping just long enough at HolyCross to attend to my reservation for St. Michael. The agent has noidea when the boat will go--maybe the 11th, maybe not until the 14th orlater.Going on an old leaky scow with an elderly, faded, chewing, not verytalkative but for all that very kindly and accommodating man, who withone hand holds the steering wheel and with the other most of the timekeeps on bailing. He carries supplies for his store and I my outfit,camera, and umbrella. Sky has here and there cleared, even patches ofsun appear on far-away clean-cut hills. Water not very rough; make fairtime downstream. Banks flat now, river broad, some hills in distance.8.00 p. m. Hills nearer ahead of us. Some of the flats look fromdistance like fine tree nurseries. Getting cool. Cloudy ahead. Thebanks flat and low, no good site for habitation. Not even fishing campshere--just long "cut-banks" (banks being cut by the river) and lowbeaches. Here and there new bars and islands that are being built bythe river. No birds, no boats, just an occasional floating snag or arare solitary gull.FOOTNOTES:[4] Alaska and Its Resources, p. 19: "Our attention was attracted bythe numerous graves. These are well worth the careful attention ofthe ethnologist; many of them are very old. The usual fashion is toplace the body, doubled up, on its side, in a box of plank hewed outof spruce logs and about 4 feet long; this is elevated several feetabove the ground on four posts, which project above the coffin or box.The sides are often painted with red chalk, in figures of fur animals,birds, and fishes."PAIMUTEPaimute down river, I am told, has nothing but Eskimo; Holy Cross, buta few natives now, mainly Indian; above Holy Cross, Indian, Eskimo onlyas adapted or in admixture.July 3, 8.30 p. m. Hills on right now right before us. Behind first afish camp of the Holy Cross Mission natives. River narrows and bends.Two other fish camps become visible. Stop; damp, cold, smoke, fishsmell, a few natives, Eskimo. River now like molten glass, but air dampand cold, and I must sit behind the engine and keep my hands over thehot exhaust pipe to keep somewhat comfortable.Pass bulging bluffs on right--old stratified shales.11.00 p. m. Arrive at our destination about 11 p. m. But a few log hutson the right side of the river, with few others and a primitive framechurch in the back. A little store and a big storehouse (with skins,etc.), trader's house (log cabin) a few rods away. Open store, only tofind that a pup had been forgotten there, made a lot of mess and dirtand ate most of one side of bacon.12.00 p. m. Got to bed in the cabin at 12. Spread bed roll on tworeindeer skins which, with fire in the stove, keep me fairly warm. Rainin night and several earth tremors--common in these parts; feel severallight ones every night and a stronger one occasionally even in daytime(a big "fault" in the Alaskan range and a proximity to the Aleutianvolcanic zone).Awake before 8, but as it still rains nothing can be done, while my manwithin a few feet of me still snores; stay in blanket till 9. Modestbreakfast at 10 a. m.10.00 a. m. A little house cleaning--watch kitten clean windows ofthe many flies, which it eats; and then my man, a Swede by birth,sailor, self-taught painter (of ships and sea scenes), and musician(accordion), goes to bail out the boat. Still full of bites thatitch and need a lot of Aseptinol, which in turn makes underwear lookdreadful. And no bath possible.Last night met some of the local Eskimo, full bloods, mostly from theKuskokwim River. Strong, kinder than the Yukon Indians. But they differbut little in some cases from the latter. They are medium brown incolor, hair exactly like the Indian, beard also--only the rather flat(not prominent) mid parts of the face, with rather long and narrow(upper two-thirds) nose, and the cheek bones protruding more or lessforward, with face long (often), due to the vertical development of thejaws, helps to distinguish them as Eskimo. There is no clear line ofdemarcation between the Indian farther up the river and the Eskimo downhere, yet in some here the Eskimo type is unmistakable. They have moreepicanthus, flatter, longer, and stronger (more massive) face, strongerframe, rather submedium length of legs, and less brachycephalic (ormore oblong) head, but not the characteristic, narrow and high,keel-shaped dome that one is used to associate with the Eskimo.1 p. m. A little lunch--just a cup of coffee and a few crackers.Photograph two natives.1.30 p. m. Start toward Russian Mission. Trader carries sugar in bagsand tea for camps.Near 2. Stop at an Eskimo camp, see sick baby, photograph a fewindividuals. Get an ax for a pocketbook--old man happy as a childat the exchange. Made another one happy this morning in payment forinformation with one of my steamer caps. (Pl. 4, _a_.)Pass along the still continuing bulging hills on the right. They areforested over lower parts, barren, though mostly greenish, above. Asusual flats on left, devoid of man. Occasionally a fish camp on right,or a small village, somewhat different, though in essentials like theIndian (more gregariousness noticeable--up river mostly individual orat most two or three families). Every favorable higher flat or lowsaddle among the hills on the right and facing the river (or a slough)is utilized by the natives, but such places are scarce.The ax obtained looks as if it had been broken after found, to make ofit a single-edge tool. Tumbled out of a bank. Old Eskimo knew not whomade it. Found some miles below Paimute by the old man. Others found,but lost. Ivory arrow and spear points also known to natives, but noone now has any.A mountain ahead of us. Sky clouded mostly, high diffuse vapors andlow, heavy but separated cumuli in the east; one would expect soona heavy rain. Visibility exceptionally good, horizons far away,uncommonly clear. Mountains sharply outlined against the sky.About 12 miles below Paimute, on left, some higher banks (old silts anddunes). The ax from the old man had been found here. Stop. Find pottery12 feet, charcoal 15 feet from surface. Also polished and workedstones. But most of bank has already been cut off and what remainsshows no signs of man on the top. (Pl. 4, _b_.)Cross river obliquely to right bank, just beyond last ("12-mile") hill.Find at once numerous evidences of stone work along the stony beach. Inan hour have a fair collection, mainly rejects, but interesting. On topof bank find several mounds and ridges, doubtless dunes, though the onefarthest up the river looks very much like a large oval man-made mound.Parts of two much-weathered skulls and one bone lay on the top of this.No definite marks of graves excepting perhaps in one instance. A signof old clearing farther down, but no "barabras." A spot well worthyof exploration. It was, I learned a little later from Nick Williams,a native who used to act as a pilot on the river, the old mountainvillage or "Ingrega-miut," and the site is 12 miles downstream fromPaimute. (Pl. 4, _c_.)Beyond are flats and cut banks, both sides, but with hills (old waterfront) behind on the right and mountains in front. River here very wide.Many of the worked stones, and occasionally, according to nativeinformation, skulls and bones, are washed out from the banks anddeposited (rolling, etc.) lower on the beach in something like strata,and in that way evidence is being perverted. Some day a new bank oreven a dune may be formed over these secondary deposits and a greatsource of possible future error be completed.All the natives along the river (to here) like to bury on the lowerslopes of near-by hills.To bed on floor of kitchen tent at the fine, clean little place ofTucker's, at 10.30. At 1.30 the 20 dogs start a fine, sustained, unisonhowl song, and I seem to hear an approaching boat. As the Governor ofAlaska is expected, slip on shoes and necktie, brush hair, and run out.There is a little boat at the little "dock" (the only one seen so faron the Yukon). Tucker and his son are already there, and I soon hearthat the governor is on the boat, which is that of Mr. Townsend, of theFish Commission. In a few minutes we meet, both in shirt sleeves. AndI learn the _Matanuska_, the boat that was to take me from the RussianMission to St. Michael, has broken down and is not coming. In herplace, but no telling as to time, will be sent the _Agnes_, a smallerand slower boat, on which three people have already this season been"gassed" (overcome by the exhaust gases), one of them jumping into theriver. She has accommodation for four persons at most, and that of themost primitive, they say. The governor fortunately gives me some hopethat I may be picked up and taken down by the same boat which is takinghim to Holy Cross. He also tells me of a skull for me at one of thestopping places, Old Hamilton. A frank, good, strong man.Boat leaves in a few minutes. Back to bed, but now almost fulldaylight--also cold, and so no more than a doze until 6.15, at whichtime the boy comes to the kitchen where I was kindly accommodatedto start fire and breakfast. So up with a drowsy head. At 7breakfast--coffee, oatmeal, flapjacks, and good company. Everythingabout this place is neat, fresh, pleasing--the best individual placeon the river. Cloudy, blustery, cool; can not start, so go 1½ milesdown to Dogfish village, or I-ka-thloy-gia-miut--probably the same asZagoskin's I-ka-lig-vig-miut. Only three or four families there now;nearly all the inhabitants died of influenza in 1900. But alreadybefore reaching the village, in examining the stones along the beach, Ifind some chipped ones, and they represent the same industry evidentlyas those at the two sites yesterday. Later find numerous chippedscrapers, pointed hammers, crude cutters and chisels, and a few axes.Make quite a collection, including a few objects found in possession ofnatives.This is a good site, above high water. Must be old. Pottery alsoencountered occasionally by present occupants, but not one bead;little if any river cutting here for a long period. Worth exploration.Photograph another Indianlike Eskimo. Want to buy an old dish from anEskimo, border inlaid with six white stones, shaped like an oblonglozenge with rounded corners, but he wants $20. Lunch all together,some Eskimo included, at Tucker's, and then as the wind moderates andthe sun comes out, start for the Russian Mission. Mostly still cloudsand cool, with some rain in the mountains to the right.Finds and inquiries made at Dogfish village make it positive that thestone culture there is Eskimo, i. e., of the Eskimo of this regionwho are probably not a little mixed with Indians. Their head is butmoderately oblong, not keel shaped. The majority, however, have Eskimofeatures.But the cupid-bow (double-grooved) axes are not known to have been madeby these people, and when used after being found or brought down fromfarther up the river they apparently were broken. One such example wasseen already at Ruby--another one at Anvik--secured; and one foundyesterday at Mountain village. The axes here are most often oblong,quadrilateral, without groove, or approaching the single-grooved axesof the Indians in the States.July 6. Proceed down the river toward Russian Mission, examining thebanks as closely as possible. Toward evening stop at "Gurtler's," ashort distance above the mission.Mr. Gurtler is a German by birth; his wife is half Indian, of Ruby.She, as well as her 14-year-old daughter, are neat, apt, and veryindustrious, quiet and nice mannered. With an Eskimo woman, she cleansand cuts up--a whole art of its own--on the average over 200 good-sizedsalmon a day. Clean place, very good smoking house--much superior tothose up the river, except Tucker's.Sleep in a clean bed of theirs; would much prefer my own and the hardfloor, but fear to offend.RUSSIAN MISSIONPack my stones and bones collected between here and Holy Cross, andafter lunch go to Russian Mission. Meet Mr. Cris Betsch, the trader,and find him both friendly and anxious to help. Teacher and her motherinvite me to supper. Before that Mr. Betsch calls in a number of theolder men, and we have a talk about ancient things, but they knownothing worth while beyond a few score of years at most; they give me,however, some data and names of old villages.A few years ago some human bones and skulls were dug up here andreburied. Eskimo readily agree to help us find them and to let metake them. Moreover, they are quite eager to dig up an old medicineman supposed to be buried under a good-sized (for this country) bluespruce. They get shovels, soon find some of the old bones and a damagedskull, and later on, with the help of information given by an elderlywoman, uncover also a female skull. Uncover further the end of twobirch-bark-covered coffins, from Russian time, and would readily digthem out did I not restrain them; as also with the medicine man. Weshall probably get some such specimens from this locality later, sothere is no need of disturbing the burials.Mrs. Barrick, the teacher, gives us a "civilized" supper, at which Iam introduced for the first time to a great and fine Yukon specialty,namely, smoked raw strips of king salmon, and find them excellent. Thena good talk with all, after which pack specimens--still somewhat damp,but it would be difficult to wait--deliver to the post, and am sent tomy place around the hill at a little past 10 p. m. with an invitationby Mr. Betsch to go to-morrow to "the slough of the 32 kashims (councilor communal house)," about 10 miles down the river. But I have alreadybeen promised by Gurtler to take me down to this place, and so I cannot accept. Just now I need sleep.July 7. After breakfast examine banks and beach along Gurtler's placeand find two stone implements, two pieces of decorated pottery, and abone of some animal. Wash, dry, and pack, then a cup of coffee--theGurtler's have a habit of drinking a second cup at about 10 a. m. eachday--and then, after some of the seemingly inevitable trouble withmotor, start down the river. It rained yesterday; the clouds show lowpressure; it is not warm and the water is somewhat rough.Stop a bit at the mission to give Mrs. Barrick a fish and get a bagor two from Mr. Betsch, and then proceed. From the river the RussianMission settlement is seen to be very favorably situated at the footof the southern slope of a big hill. But the recency of the flat belowand in front of the church and schoolhouse is clearly seen again. Thesite about where the church and school are may--in fact must, it is sofavored--be a very old one, and doubtless a thorough excavation of theslope from the back of the houses upward would be both easy and veryinstructive. The place should by all means receive attention.Reach and examine the "32 kashim slough," a beautiful side channelabout 7 miles long; reach about 1½ miles from its entrance, examinebanks and pass through jungle, find tracks of foxes and of a bear,also see one big beautiful red fox trotting ahead of us on the otherbeach--but not a trace of man. Examine also the "mounds" on GrandIsland, but find them to be only dunes.Lunch on the beach; remarkably few mosquitoes and no gnats; smoked rawsalmon strips again, and coffee; and at 5 leave for home, it beingimpossible so late to go down to the end of the channel.On return all going nicely until 5. Then, in a slough 3½ miles from theRussian Mission, after an examination of another likely site, breakdownof the motor. Do everything possible to make it go until about 8, butin vain. Then I take the crazy little rowboat that luckily we took withus, bail out the water with our shovel, and row to the mission forhelp. Get there about 9, send back a launch with some natives, have alittle supper with the teacher, and row home around the hill, reachingGurtler's near 11. In a few minutes the launch is towed in and all iswell once more. Mr. Betsch got for us two good native "kantágs" orwooden dishes. Also we fix to go down to the "32 kashims" to-morrowonce more with Mr. Betsch and the teacher.July 8. Up a little after 6; breakfast; and then comes in a native fromthe mission with two letters and information that the _Agnes_, thelittle mail-carrier boat, has arrived during the night and is waitingfor me to take me to Marshall and to Old Hamilton, whence anotherboat will take me in a day or two to St. Michael. So get ready in aminute, put my baggage on a native's boat, pay my bill, leave anotherlot of good friends, and row to the mission. There is the littledinghy _Agnes_ with its "accommodation" for three passengers alreadytwo-thirds filled up, and towing two big logs as a freight. Put mythings partly in a "bunk," partly on the roof, give good-byes to Betschand the teacher, help to push off the boat which is stuck in the mud,and we are off for another Yukon chapter.We pass by the lower end of the "32 kashim" slough--no sign of anysite--all recently made flats. If there is anything left of the oldsites it must be at the foot of the hills, or has been covered withsilt. The site is so favorable that in all probability there was oncethere a good-sized settlement, but due to river action and the jungleit could not be located. Mr. Betsch visited the place that day, andagain with some old natives on another occasion, without being morefortunate.Cloudy, slightly drizzly day, no trace of sun, mists over the tops ofthe hills. Could not stand it in the boat, so sitting on my box on theroof of the boat, wrapped, due to the cold, in a blanket.A little below the "32 kashim" slough a small stream enters frominland--a place to be examined; but this boat can not stop for such apurpose.A half mile or so farther down a few graves and crosses, with remnantsof a native habitation.Over 3 miles down, just beyond first bluff, fine site, with low hillsstretching far beyond it--now but a few empty, half-ruined nativehouses. Should be explored.South of second rocky bluff a live camp, and farther down another.The left side of the river is still all flats as far as one can see,but about 17 miles below Russian Mission human bones came out of a bankthere (on a slough).MARSHALLAt 3 p. m. reach Marshall, a little cheerful-looking mining town,high on a bank. See the place, identify the skeleton from theabove-mentioned bank as that of a missing white man, see telegraphoperator, postmaster, teacher, commissioner. Sun comes out, is warm.Almost no mosquitoes here and no gnats. Hills above and beyond townbelong already to the coast range and are barren of trees, even largelybare of shrubs and bushes. Leave 4.30.Soon after Marshall--after passing by an Eskimo village (white man'sstyle of buildings)--leave the hills and enter flats on both sides.This is the beginning of the delta region. River like glass, and it iswarm in the sun but very perceptibly cooler when sun is hidden.The boat has only three bunks, and there are five of us with the twopilots. But on the last trip up, there were, fortunately only for abouteight hours, seven, including two women and a child, and that withoutany privacy or conveniences whatsoever. It is almost criminal, and theycharge a very steep fare. However, for me it will soon be over--onlyabout 36 hours. Still it is hard to believe this is yet in the UnitedStates and presumably under some sort of supervision.Which brings me to a realization that the first half of my journey--thepreliminary survey of the Yukon--is slowly closing; a little, and itwill be the sea and other conditions, which also brings the realizationthat I have seen much but learned not greatly. What should be donewould be to own a suitable fast boat; to locate on each of the moreimportant old sites a party for careful, prolonged excavation; and totry to locate, in the rear of or on the higher places on the presentriver flats, more ancient sites than are known to date. These steps,together with the enlisting of the interest in these matters of everyprospector, miner, and trader, would before many years lead to muchsubstantial knowledge.Friday, July 9. Must keep up these notes, for they alone keep me postedon the day and date; even then I am not always sure. There are noSundays in nature.Slept in my bag on the roof of the _Agnes_. Her namesake must have beenone of these goodly but insufficient and but indifferently clean nativewomen, plodding, doing not a little work, but wanting in many a thing.It was cold and dreary, but I found an additional blanket, and so, withmosquito netting about my head--one or two got in anyway--would haveslept quite well had it not been for a dog. At about 1 a. m. we stoppedin front of a little place called also "Mountain Village." And almostat once we began to hear a most piteous and insistent wail of a dogwho either had colic or thirst or hunger, and he kept it up with butlittle stops for what seemed like two hours, making my sleep, at least,impossible.Saturday, July 9. Morning. Cold, cloudy, rough--head almost beginningto feel uncomfortable, the boat is tossing so much. A teacher comesaboard with an inflamed hand which I fix; a few questions, the mailbag, and we are off again. Enter a slough where it is less rough andwarmer. Later the sun will probably come out again. This evening weshall be at Old Hamilton and then a new anxiety--how to get to St.Michael.Just had a little walk over the roof--my roof, for the other twopassengers prefer to sleep in the gassy, dingy room below, though howthey can stand it is beyond my medical ken. It is four short stepslong, or five half steps in an oblique direction.Every object in distance appears magnified all along the river formany days now. An old snag will look like a boat or a man, hills lookhigher, a boat looks much more pretentious than she proves to be onmeeting.Firs and spruce have now completely disappeared, also forests of birch,etc., are reduced to brush both on flats and lower parts of hills.Very large portion of the hills in distance just greenish with grassand lichens, not even a brush.9.45 a. m. Meet the _Matanuska_ bound upward. Looked from distance likean ocean steamer; from near, just a lumbering, moderate-sized riverboat with a barge in front. But a whole lot better than ours.The scenery has become monotonous. The gray river, although only oneof the "mouths," is broad, and the country is all low. Nothing butbushy or grassy cut banks on the right, and mud flats, "smoking" underthe wind, to low banks on left. It is a little warmer and the warm sunshows itself occasionally, but I still need the wrapping of a doubleblanket. The wind luckily is with us and the waves not too bad.Noon. Passing "Fish village"; a few huts and tents.No "camps" here outside the few villages; just an endless dreary wasteand water.New Hamilton--a few native huts only now--no whites.Reach Old Hamilton--about a dozen houses with a warehouse, a store ofthe Northern Commercial Co., and a nice looking but now unoccupiedschool.Here the governor told me there was somewhere a skull waiting for me,and the storekeeper would tell me of it. But when we arrive there areonly two or three natives to meet us. The storekeeper, who is alsopostmaster, is said to be sick in bed. He is supposed to have an ulceror some other bad thing of the stomach. So we go to his house and findhim in bed, with a lot of medicine bottles on a table next to him. Isalone; no wife. Shows no enthusiasm in seeing me, though heard of mycoming. Reads letters--no attention to me. Gets up--I ask him about hisillness--answers like a man carrying a chip on his shoulder. Goes tostore to attend to mail, and barely asks me to follow. I wait in store;he finishes mail and goes out--orders the Eskimo present out gruffly,and to me says, "You may stay in the store; I'll be back." But I waitand wait, and finally decide the man for some reason is unwillingto help me. Asked him before he went out about the _Matanuska_, buthe told me she might not be back from Holy Cross in a month, tryingdoubtless to discourage me to stay. On going toward the _Agnes_ I findhim sitting on a log and talking to a couple of men from a tugboat thathas arrived--just talk, no business, judging from their laughing. SoI go on the boat, write a few words to Mr. Townsend of the Bureau ofFisheries, who makes this place his headquarters, and with some feelinghand this to the man, telling him at the same time that plainly he doesnot wish to assist me in any way. This, of course, rouses him; he getsred and says a few lame words, ending with, "Do you think I would touchany of them dam things or that I would let any of my men (natives)touch them? Not on your life!" So I leave Old Hamilton, for he is theonly white man there now. But the place had other distinctions. Untilrecently, I am told, they have had a teacher, a young girl, who in herzeal had the natives collect all the burial boxes with their contentsand had them all thrown into the river. Not long after she accomplishedthat she left. The storekeeper told me that "If I want them so bad Icould pick them up (skulls and bones) along the river where the waterwashed them out after the teacher threw them in." Luckily there werenot many "Old Hamiltons."We met here a boat from St. Michael with Mr. Frank P. Williams, thewell-known postmaster and trader of St. Michael, who comes for thetwo men, my fellow passengers. We get acquainted and, to escape thegases of the _Agnes_, I go with them. The boat is heavier and freefrom fumes, though without accommodation. At about 7 p. m. we arriveat Kotlik, at the mouth of the river--an abandoned wireless station,a store, and four tents of natives. But the old wireless building,now the storekeeper's house, is the dwelling place of a clean whiteman, Mr. Backlund, who is now "outside," but with whom Mr. Williamsis in some partnership; so we occupy the building. Outside the windhas risen to half a gale and there are squalls of rain and drizzle.The _Agnes_ has to "tie to," as she would be swamped in the open. Myboxes and bedding, which were on the roof of the _Agnes_, are soaked,though the contents will be dry. So both boats are fastened to a little"dock," and we soon have fire in the stove, supper, and then--it is 11p. m.--a bed, not overclean, somewhat smelly, but a bed and free frommosquitoes, rain, wind, and cold.July 10. Up at 6.30. Outside a storm and rain--just like one of thethree-day northeasters with us, and cool. Both boats were to leave, butare unable to do so. I find that Mr. Williams's tug will come back hereand go to St. Michael on the 13th, so arrange with Mr. Williams to takeme and leave the _Agnes_ for good. This partly because I learn of twograveyards near, one 1½, the other 4½ miles distant.After lunch, rain for a while ceasing, I set out for the nearer burialplace. This is already a tundra country--treeless and bush-less flatsovergrown with a thick coat of moss, into which feet bury themselvesas in a cushion, and dotted with innumerable swampy depressions withhigh swamp grass. Walking over all this is very difficult--lucky I haverubber boots. Even so, it is no easy matter, except where a littlenative trail is encountered.The graveyard, belonging to the now abandoned little village aboveKotlik, consists of only about half a dozen adult graves. These consistof boxes of heavy lumber laid on a base raised above the groundlevel, and covered with other heavy boards. Some of the burials arequite recent. Open three older ones. In two the remains are too freshyet, but from one secure a good female skeleton, which I pack in apractically new heavy pail, thrown out probably on the occasion of thelast funeral. Then back, farther out, to avoid notice, through swampsand over moss, and with a recurring wind-driven drizzle against whichmy umbrella is but a weak protection.Reach home quite wet and a bit tired. Have to undress and, wrapped in ablanket, dry my clothes and underwear about the stove.Nothing further this day and evening--just wind and heavy low cloudsand rain.July 11. Up at 4.40. Weather has moderated. The _Agnes_ left at 4and Mr. Williams's boat, due to favorable tide, must soon go also.Breakfast, and all leave me before 6.Yesterday we brought up my needs--i. e., collection of skeletalmaterial--to the few natives here, explaining to them everything, andthey do not object in the least. One of them, in fact, is to take meto-day to the more distant cemetery in a rowboat and help me in my work.My man, after being sent for, comes at a little after 7. He is agood-looking and well-behaving Eskimo of about 35. He brings agood-sized tin rowboat--a whaling or navy boat probably; but "he leaksa whole lot." The oarlocks are not fastened to the boat, the plate ofone is loose, and the oars are crudely homemade of driftwood and piecesof lumber fastened on with nails; in one the shaft is crooked, whilethe other is much heavier. But we start, with the sky still leaden andgray but no wind and calm water. I row and he paddles; then he rowsand I paddle. We carry but the camera, a little lunch, a heavier coateach, and a box and two bags for the specimens. We pass a number ofbroods of little ducks, the mother prancing before us until the youngare in safety, and there are several species of new kinds (to me) ofwater birds, some of which fly right above us, examining us. In thedistance we see a big abandoned dredge, then a few empty log houses and"barabras" on the bank of a stream and the edge of the tundra. Thisis Pastolik, our destination. There is no one anywhere near, an idealcondition for work, if work there'll be. And there will be--for almostimmediately upon landing I see, beginning at a few rods distance on thetundra, a series (about 50) of old graves, in all grades of mossinessand preservation. A few are, we later find, quite late, but themajority are old--60 years and over according to information given bythe natives of Kotlik. They do not, except perhaps the few late ones,seem to belong to anyone still living. Yet "Pashtolik," as they wroteit then, used to be a place of some importance in the Russian times,and even later.We settle in an empty native house, and I start investigation. Theolder graves are found widely spread in several clusters, but a few areisolated at a distance.The graves are all aboveground and resemble in substance those alongthe lower Yukon (Bonasila and downward). They consist of a base ofsmall logs or splits; a rude box about 3 feet long by about 2 feetwide, of heavy, unpainted, unnailed, split boards; four posts near thefour corners; a cover, unjoined, of two to three heavy split boards;two crosspieces over this, at head and base, perforated and slidingover the upright posts, and a few half splits (smaller drift logs splitin two) laid over the top of the crosspieces.On the first cover lies as a rule a stone--generally a piece of a slabor a good-sized pebble--unworked, though now and then showing sometrace of use. The pebble is generally broken.When the grave is opened there is usually over the body, as a canopyon a light frame, a large (probably caribou) skin--rarely birch bark.Neither covers or envelops the body but simply forms a covering overit, with some space between it and the body. The body lies flexed, onleft or (rarely) right side, with the head toward (or near) the east(same as at Bonasila). It is often covered with or enveloped in anative matting. There are but few traces of clothing on women; none onmen. And very seldom is there anything else in the coffin.Some of the oldest graves were found tumbled down and could not beexamined. The moss and roots envelop the bones, and it is a tough jobto get them out; also they eat the bones and destroy them. Even in theolder boxes, however, the downward part of the skeleton--generally theleft--is, due to moisture, usually in much worse state of preservationthan the upper.Children have been buried in large native wooden dishes and these werein some cases placed on the top of adult graves, but more generallyabout these, or even apart.Many household articles, from matches and pails to dishes, alarmclocks, lamps, etc., are placed upon the ground near the more recentdead. Excavation would probably recover here many older objects, thoughwood decays.The wind has died down and the flat is as full of mosquitoes as aJersey salt meadow, and there is an occasional gnat. They bite, and,having been almost free of the pest at Kotlik, I failed to take my"juice" along, so just have to do the best possible. The gnats entereven the eyes, however.Work as never before. Decide to utilize the rare opportunity to thelimit, and to take the whole skeletons, not merely the skulls, leavingonly the few fresher ones and those that are badly damaged. A greatSunday; burial after burial; opening the wooden grave--taking outand marking on the spot bone after bone--fighting mosquitoes allthe while--and packing temporarily in any convenient receptacle.Fortunately there are quite a few boxes and pails and oil cans on thespot, left by the dredge people and the few natives who evidentlysometimes come to the place. At about 2 eat lunch--coffee (the Eskimoput what was for three cups into about two quarts of water, so thereis but a suggestion of coffee), raw smoked fish for me and eggs withbacon (left over from breakfast) for my companion, and on again untilabout 5 p. m. or a little later. Last two or three hours, however, workwith some difficulty. A gnat bit me in an eyelid, or got into my eye,and that has now swollen so that I can hardly see with it. My Eskimo,however, is about all I could wish. He just looks at me working ina matter-of-fact way, and carries the filled boxes, or looks aroundfor something I could take with me, and even helps on a few occasionswith the bones, finding evidently the whole proceeding quite rightand natural. Brings me, among other things, an old copper teakettle,but to his wonder I do not want it and leave it. I find a fine largewalrus-ivory doll and a handsome decorated "kantág" (wooden bowl),besides smaller objects, and also a large piece of a poor quality claypot (no pottery now), with a fragment of a decorated border as on thelower Yukon.Pack up, we load on the boat--lucky now she is so spacious--get intothe shallow river--the tide has run out--push the boat out and startfor home.Thus far we had but slight drizzles. But the clouds now grow heavier,and as we have much farther to row than this morning, due to the lowwater, we are caught by showers. The last mile or so we have to hurry,see a big rain approaching. My man pushes her with a pole while I rowall I can, with both hands, with the heavy oar. Of course the wholepopulation of Kotlik has to see our arrival. And more, too, for in ourabsence a schooner came in with wood and a number of the natives. Theytalk, but no one is either angry or excited. We two carry the boxes,pails, etc.--grass covered--into the house; how lucky I am now alone.Inside I remove the wet grass from them--the bones, too, are somewhatwet--then pay my Eskimo $5, which again is taken as a matter-of-factthing, without thanks, but he well deserved the amount, even if I roweda full half.It is 9 p. m. My man comes again, we have a modest supper, hesome left-over meat and I again the smoked fish, which I feel isstrengthening me as well as agreeing with my stomach, and thento rest, quite earned to-day. Seldom have done as much in a day.Thirty-three graves collected, with over twenty nearly completeskeletons, and all restored so that I had to take considerable care notto go again into some already emptied. But this place should be dugover. The tundra in a few years swallows up everything on the surface.It literally buries or assimilates bones and all other objects, themoss and other vegetation with probably blown dust covering them veryeffectively. Finding anything below the surface and that even a footor more, as was actually experienced, means something quite differentunder these conditions than it might elsewhere.Monday, July 12. Slept fairly well and feel refreshed, but the eyestill badly swollen. The Eskimo believe, I think, I got it from thebones. Yet they are quite sensible--a marked mental difference betweenthem and the Yukon Indians.Breakfast before 7--cereal, raw smoked fish, and coffee. Then pack.At the store buy empty gasoline boxes, but no nails to be had, and nopacking. Lunch at 1--macaroni, raw smoked fish, sauerkraut, coffee;then pack again, fix boxes, break old ones to get nails, even pull afew unnecessary ones from the boards of the house, go see my man'swife, a hopeless consumptive, and at 6 through with all exceptcleaning. Another fair work-day, 12 tightly packed boxes. Then cleanup, burn rubbish, and ready for departure early to-morrow.Supper--macaroni, raw smoked fish, greengage plums, a littlesauerkraut, and coffee. Then a little walk outside, watch Eskimo womenand children jump the rope (hilariously, but awkwardly), and go in tocatch up with my notes. Nobody scowls at me, so that although theyprobably fear me as a "medicine man" they are not at all resentful forwhat I did yesterday. They are grown-up children, much more tractablethan the Indians. But otherwise they show so much in common with theIndian that the more one sees of them the more he grows drawn to thebelief of the original (and that not so far distant) identity of theirparentage. It seems the Eskimo and the Indian are after all no morethan two diverging fingers of one and the same hand; or they were soa bit farther back. Mental differences there are, yet these are nomore than may be found in different tribes of the Indians or differentgroups of other races.Tuesday, July 13. Rise a little after 6. Eye still sore after Sunday'sgnat and sweat and dirt; must use boric acid frequently. An Eskimoactually said yesterday it was a sickness from touching the bones. Alittle breakfast--have no more salmon strips, so just cereal, cannedplums, and coffee. And then with the help of two young Eskimo carry myspoils and baggage on to the tug, which has come for me. By about 7start. Good-by Kotlik, what little there is of it.At 9 arrive at Mr. Williams's reindeer camp farther up the coast. Thereare five tents and two small log houses of natives--the herders withtheir families, dogs, and fish racks; and three whites, Mr. Williams,owner of the boat and of most of the herd of about 8,000 animals;Mr. Palmer, of the United States Biological Survey; and a Dane, Mr.Posielt, here for the Biological Survey of Canada. All are already atthe corral some distance over the hill, branding, counting, etc., thegreat reindeer herd, which belong to several owners.A short walk along the shore brings me in sight of the herd. Theanimals can be heard grunting a good distance off. The herd is so largeand so compact that it looks like a forest of horns. The animals keepon moving in streams, but remain in the herd. They go to the shore todrink some of the salty water, instead of salt. All is of interest,even though the branding, the cutting off of big slices from the ears,and castration, is rather cruel.At lunch, for the first time, reindeer meat, a select steak. It istender and decidedly good. Has no special flavor and is poor in fat,but tender and good.Afternoon, once more to the corral, and then various things, includinga photograph of a little impromptu native group.Supper once more on reindeer meat. This time prepared as a sort of astew with onions--again very good. But we were to leave after supperfor St. Michael and I see no intention to that effect. Instead they allgo once more to the corral to continue the work until about 11 p. m.So I have to settle for the night, with some hope that we may leave inthe morning. We sleep four side by side in a tent 10 feet wide. Luckilythey had a spare clean blanket or two, and but one of the three snores,and he like a lady; also the weather has cleared and is warmer, so thenight is fairly good.Wednesday, July 14. Morning bright, calm. Breakfast, and all hurry offto corral without even any explanation--just a few casual words, fromwhich I understand that we shall not go. So I write whole forenoon,though feeling none too good about the delay. Had I my own boat, asone should have in this country, all would be different. As it is I amutterly helpless. At lunch speak to Mr. Williams; and though not muchwilling, he half promises that we may go to St. Michael to-night.Afternoon. Walk 8 miles along the beach, to a cape and back, lookingin vain for traces of human habitation and collecting along the beachwhat this offers, which outside of some odd, flat, polished stones isbut little. Come back near 6--soon after supper--and hear with muchsatisfaction that, after all, we will go to-night to St. Michael.                                 RÉSUMÉSo ends the Yukon and its immediate vicinity. What has been learned?1. The great and easily navigable river, extending for many hundreds ofmiles from west to east, could not but have played a material part inthe peopling of Alaska, and quite probably in that of the continent,and all human movements along it must have left some material remains.It seems, therefore, a justified inference that the valley of the Yukonharbors human remains of much scientific value.2. Such remains, judging from the present conditions, were leftexclusively along the banks of the river, on the flood-safe elevatedplatforms of the banks, and especially about the mouths of thetributaries of the Yukon of those times.3. But the banks and mouths of the past are seldom, if ever, thoseof to-day. The river, with its currents, storms, and ice pack everyspring, is changing from year to year. It is ever cutting and erodingin places, and building bars and islands or covering with flood siltsin others. In many stretches no one can be sure where the banks were500 or 1,000 years ago, not to speak of earlier periods.4. The banks and islands of to-day, therefore, are for the most partrecent formations, in which it would be useless to expect anything veryancient. And there is nothing like the successive ocean beaches at Nomeand elsewhere, which would guide exploration.5. The right hilly side of the river alone seems to offer some hope oflocating some more ancient sites and remains; yet it is quite certainthat the river ran once far to the left, for all the vast flats on thatside are of its construction; so that the more ancient remains of manmay lie in that direction. But there everything is, from the point ofview of archeology, a practically unexplorable jungle and wilderness,and there is no one there who might make accidental discoveries.6. It would seem that the best hope for the archeologist along theYukon, so far as the more ancient remains are concerned, lies along thetributaries of the stream, and that particularly at the old limits ofthe more recently made lands.7. Nevertheless the banks of the Yukon as they are now are not whollybarren. Up from Tanana, at the Old Station, probably about Ruby andNulato, about Kaltag and the Greyling River, at Bonasila, Holy Crossand Ghost Creek, and at the Mountain village, Dog village, RussianMission, and doubtless a number of other sites, they contain bothcultural and skeletal remains that, if recovered, will be invaluable tothe anthropological history of these regions.8. The line of demarcation between the Indians of the Yukon and theEskimo, outside of language, is indefinite. Traces of old Eskimoadmixture are perceptible among the Indians far up the river, and thecultures of the two peoples in many respects merge into each other;while among the Eskimo of the lower river and farther on there arephysiognomies that it would be hard to separate from the Indian.Whether all this means simply extensive past mixture, or whether, aswould seem, the Alaska Indians as a whole are nearer physically to theEskimo than are the tribes in the States, remains to be determined.Among the Athapascan Mescalero Apache, who have reached as far south asNew Mexico, a somewhat Eskimoid tinge to the face, especially in youngwomen, was by no means very unusual 25 years ago when I studied thistribe. This problem will be touched upon again in this volume.9. All along the Yukon, from near Tanana (Old Station) to the mouthof the river, in the Indian and in the Eskimo region, there prevailedthe same type of winter house, namely, a largely subterranean roomwith a subterranean tunnel or corridor entrance; and also a similartype of summer dwelling, formerly a skin, now a canvas, tent. Thewinter dwellings were built within of stout posts and covered withbirch bark and sod, looking from outside much like the present-dayNavaho hogan; while the pits left by them remind one of thesouthwestern "pit dwellings," the kashims of the Pueblo kivas. As ahogan, so these largely subterranean dwellings along the Yukon had asmoke-air-and-light hole in the center of the top, a fireplace in themiddle of the floor, and benches (of heavy hewn planks in the north)along the sides. Each village, furthermore, had at least one largerstructure of similar nature, the "kashim," or communal house. All thismay still be traced more or less plainly on the dead sites along theYukon, and houses as well as a kashim of this type were seen at Kotlikand Pastolik, at the mouth of the river.10. The native industry of the river presents also much similarity,though there are differences.Pottery, of much the same type and decoration, was made at least as faras the lower middle Yukon.Stone implements were made and used all along the river, and were muchalike. But the double-grooved, cupid-bow ax of the Yukon Indian, haftedin the center and used for chipping rather than cutting, is lower downreplaced by the same ax, in which one end has been broken off (orhas not been finished), and which is hafted as an adze; or by oblongquadrilateral flat axes which have not been found up the river.The peculiar and apparently very primitive stone industry of Bonasilais, it seems, just a development of local conditions--nature of mostavailable stone, and essentially hunting habit of the people thatresulted in many skins which called for numerous scrapers. Neverthelessthe site deserves a thorough further exploration.There was apparently not much basketry along the river, the place ofthe baskets being taken by the birch-bark dishes of the Indian and thekantág or ingeniously made wooden dish of the Eskimo part of the river.Canoes among the Yukon Indians were mainly of birch bark, while theEskimo had mainly skin canoes.11. Neither the Indians nor the Eskimo of the Yukon practiceddeformation of the head or of any other part of the body, or dentalmutilation. The Indians as well as the Eskimo occasionally pierced theseptum of the nose, for nose pieces, while the Eskimo cut on each sidea slit in the lower lip for the introduction of labrets. The Eskimo cuttheir hair short in a characteristic way, reminding strongly of certainmonks; the Indians left their hair long. But at Anvik the Indians bothcut their hair and wore labrets. They also used the wooden dish.12. From all the preceding it appears that there must have been longand intensive contacts between the Yukon Eskimo and Indians; that,through war or in peace, they became mutually admixed; and that therewere mutual cultural transmissions.13. No further light for the present could be gained on the origin,antiquity, or early migrations of the Yukon Indian. It was determined,however, that he represents but one main physical type, and that thistype is the same as that of the Indians of the Tanana and most otherAlaskan Indians of the present time.14. Exceptional skeletal remains were washed out from the bank atBonasila. They are of Indians (?), but appear to be not those of theYukon Indian of to-day. They present a problem which is to be solved byfurther exploration of the site.15. The Eskimo of the lower parts of the river are in general betterpreserved and more coherent than the Indians. They are more tractablepeople and are taking more readily to work and civilization.16. These Eskimo show, in the majority of cases, fairly typical Eskimophysiognomies. But their heads are not as those of the northern andeastern members of the race. The head is less narrow, less high, andhas but now and then a suggestion of the scaphoid form that is socharacteristic of the Greenland, Labrador, or northern Eskimo cranium;also, the angles of the jaws are less bulging and the lower jawsthemselves do not appear so heavy.17. The Yukon Eskimo burials are in all essentials much like thoseof the Indians up the river. Here again a cultural connection isvery evident, in this case there having in all probability been anadaptation of methods by the Eskimo from the Indians.18. Archeological prospects along the delta flats occupied by theEskimo appear very limited.ST. MICHAELThursday, July 15. In the morning, after a good trip, reach St.Michael--quite a town from a distance, with many boats on the shore infront of it; but soon find that it is largely a dead city and ships'graveyard, not harbor. With the gold rush over, and the Governmentrailroad from Seward to the Tanana, men and business have departed.Before the summer is over most of the large buildings and the finelarge boats are to be demolished, and there will be left but a lonelyvillage.Unload my collections on the old dock. The postman kindly comes downfrom his place, which, with Mr. Williams's store, is far up on thehill above the harbor, the boxes are weighed and stamped for theparcel post, and relieved of them I go to the hotel and spend the dayin visiting the teacher, the marshal, Mr. Williams's store, whereI see a whole lot of recent Eskimo ceremonial masks decorated withcolors and feathers, and the wireless station to send a message tothe Institution. All native (Eskimo) character is almost gone fromthe place, what remains being mainly civilized mix bloods; and alsolittle, if anything, remains to be collected, particularly now when allvacant land is thickly overgrown with grass and weeds. An occasionalskull appears, one having been seen recently on the beach and one onWhale Island, but there is little besides, though things could be founddoubtless by excavation.Items of interest in Mr. Williams's store, and also in that of the N.C. Co., are various articles cut handsomely by the Eskimo from walrusivory, both fresh and "fossil" (old and nicely discolored). There arebeads, napkin rings, hairpins, cigar and cigarette holders, and otherobjects, generally exceedingly well made and decorated. It is, ofcourse, well known that the Eskimo are very apt in this work; it isnot, however, so well known that every island or village has certainspecialties and types of decoration. This is so true that an observerbefore long can tell in many instances just where a given article hasbeen made.The fossil ivory industry is, it was soon learned, becoming a seriousdetriment to archeological work in these regions; of which, however,more later.During the day I find that a small boat, the _Silver Wave_, belongingto Lomen Bros., will leave St. Michael for Nome that same evening. Asthis suits me very well I engage a berth on the boat, help to get mybaggage on deck over a broken landing place, and get ready to depart.At 6 leave St. Michael. The _Silver Wave_ is a tub--too short--amtold if it were of proper length they would have to have more help.Result--very unsteady. Fortunately the weather is fair, and thecaptain gives me a berth in his cabin. I had originally a stateroom,right in the back, with three bunks or beds, so small that one couldbarely get into the beds; but there came two mix-breed women with agirl and so they turned me out and put me in the "hole"--seven bunksin an ill-ventilated cabin under the deck in the stern of the ship.She is only about 60 feet long by about 15 broad. As it is I have abunk in what would have been a well-ventilated little cabin, had itnot been for rough weather which came on later in the night and whichnecessitated the closing of the window.Friday, July 16. The rougher weather came and the boat began to pitchand roll. Luckily I slept for the most part. At about 6.30 the captaincalled me to breakfast with him. I got up rather groggy from the sea,but managed to wash my face and get to the little messroom, where thecook started to bring eggs, bacon, coffee, etc.--and then I had enoughand had all I could do to reach my bunk again without getting seasick.I was kept on the verge of it until after 10, when we arrived off Nome.This, however, meant no relief. There was no bay, no dock, no shelterfor even such a small boat, and so we anchored a few hundred yards offthe shore along which stretch the long line of unpainted (mostly),weather-beaten frame dwellings of this northern capital.By this time I barely keep my feet, but they lowered a heavy rowboat,and several of us--there were four other men passengers--are helpedto tumble in. I get back, and to steady myself catch hold of theborders of the boat, only for this the next moment to be dashed againstthe larger boat with my hand between. It was almost too much, theseasickness and added to it the very painful hurt. Fortunately thefingers were not crushed, just bruised badly--they might easily havebeen mashed to a pulp.They row us in and we tumble out on the sand, and there is no one toreceive anybody or take any notice. However, after a while there comesaccidentally an old two-seated Ford. Three of us crowd in, leave thefew bulkier things we brought along on the beach unguarded, and aredriven to the other end of the town, to the Golden Gate Hotel.This is a big old frame building, out of plumb in several directions.There is no one in the spacious lobby. However, after a time some one,not looking much like a proprietor--more like a groom at work--comesout from somewhere and without much ado shows us each to a room. Minesmells musty, old sweat and blankets and mould, and looks out on adilapidated tin roof--must ask for another. Finally get one "front" for$3--the other was only $2.50. Musty too, but fairly large, and with adouble bed with, at last again, clean covers.Unshaven--in the khaki worse for rain and work--with fingers so sorethey can not bear a touch, feverish, and head still dizzy--I go tolunch. On my way stop at Coast Guard building--no one there; at theRoads Commission--office empty; at the Customs--not a soul. But at thecourthouse they tell me where Judge Lomen sometimes lunches, and so Igo there. It is near by--nothing here is far distant--and so I soon sitat Mrs. Niebeling's, a justly famed Nome's "for everybody," at a cleantable and to a big civilized dinner. Order reindeer roast--find it thistime, in my condition, not much to boast of--one could hardly tell itfrom similarly done beef--and begin on the coffee when in comes a youngman, asks me if I am the doctor, and introduces himself as Mr. AlfredLomen, the judge's son; and in a minute or two in comes the judgehimself, a kindly man of something over 70. It all makes me feel a lotbetter, though still weak. Have rest of lunch together and talk, butdo not get very far in anything that interests me; but the judge takesme to the Catholic Fathers here, who have an orphanage somewhere nearwhere I want next to go, and leaves me with Father Post. The father iskindly, but himself does not know much, and so makes arrangements forme to meet next day Father Lafortune, who works among the Eskimo.Then I go once more to the Coast Guard building and meet CaptainRoss, in charge. The _Bear_, I learn, has just arrived here, and issoon going north. She is my godsend, evidently. So Captain Ross sendsme over to see Captain Cochran. The meeting is good, and I have apromise to be taken to the cape and some other stations. But the _Bear_goes first to coal at St. Michael, and then will make a visit to St.Lawrence Island. So I propose to go to Teller first, see what I can ofthe Chukchee-Eskimo "battle field" near there, and be taken from thereby the _Bear_. The priests give me some hope for getting there over aninland route, but later on tell me one of the boats of the orphanagewhich is located in that region is away and the other has broken down,so that there will be no possibility of making the trip through theSalt Lake and to Teller. But the _Victoria_ (the Seattle boat to cometo-night) will go to Teller. Unfortunately, if weather is rough orthere are no passengers she will not stop at Nome, so all is againuncertain. The _Silver Wave_ goes northward next Monday, but I have adread of her. All of which is put down merely to show slightly what anexplorer without a boat of his own may expect in these regions.Nome, Saturday, July 17. Poor night again--it surely seems to be thefashion in Alaska. The _Victoria_ came at night (or what should benight). The ramshackle big frame hotel, with partitions so thin thatthey transmit every sound, got about 40 guests, and next room to minecame to be occupied by two women who had visitors, female and male,were taken out for a ride after 12 and returned about 2 a. m. One ofthem, or their visitor, had a perpetual vocal gush, the others chimedin now and then, and a strong male voice added the bass from time totime, with old Fords noisily coming and going outside, and peoplegoing up and down the stairs. So sleep for some hours was out of thequestion. And there was nothing to do about it.After breakfast went to meet Father Lafortune, a Catholic missionarypriest to the Eskimo, who speaks their language well and who promisedto accompany me to their habitations; and together we spent theforenoon on one side of the town, among the natives of the Diomedes,and most of the afternoon on the other end among the people from KingIsland. It was a good experience, resulting in seeing a good many ofthe Eskimo and getting some information, a few photographs, and quitea few old specimens. Then we went to the parsonage, where I got a fewgood photos from Father Lafortune's collection. He is a matter-of-fact,always ready to help, natural he-man, rather than a priest and teacher,and a great practical helper to the natives, who all are his friends.Also saw Judge Lomen, arranged for lecture to-morrow, saw Captain Rossabout the _Bear_, and various other people; but there is not much to beobtained here about old sites and specimens. Telegraphed Institution,and also to the Russian consul at Montreal for permission to visit theGreat Diomede Island. Evening packing. Natives bring walrus ivory, someexcellent pieces. Weather whole day cloudy, threatening, occasionalshowers, cool but not cold.Sunday, July 18. Heavy sleep 10 p. m. to 7 a. m., regardless of atypewriter going in the next room and the women (now quieter, however)on the other side.Forenoon spent in talking with people and attending a little service,for the natives mainly, at the Catholic Church of Fathers Post andLafortune. Poor, simple, but sincere and interesting.After lunch more consultations, then a visit to bank where they smeltgold dust (even to-day), and then a lecture on "The Peopling ofAmerica," at the courthouse. Well attended, and many came to shakehands after. Then a dinner, with examination of a number of interestingand valuable specimens, at Judge Lomen's. Among other objects there isa duplicate, in ivory, of the broken double ax from the Yukon, the twogrooves and even the break being well represented. Evening--examinationof specimens at Reverend Baldwin's. Cloudy, cool, threatening, butstormy weather abating.ABOUT NOMEDue to the delay with the _Bear_, the next few days until July 23 werespent at and about Nome. They proved more profitable than was expected.Numbers of interesting specimens were found in the possession of someof the dealers, and more of those of scientific value were securedeither through gift or by purchase for the National Museum. Thesecollections consisted of objects of stone--i. e., spear points, knives,axes, etc.--but above all of utensils, spear points, effigies, etc.,some of them of remarkable artistry and decoration, were made of walrusivory that through age has turned "fossil."Among the stone objects were several axes made of the greenish, hardnephrite which came from the "Jade Mountain" on the Kobuk River. Theobjects from fossil ivory came principally from the St. LawrenceIsland, the Diomede Islands, Cape Wales, unknown parts of the nearerAsiatic coast, and here and there from the Seward Peninsula.A large majority of these objects are now collected by the nativesthemselves, who assiduously excavate the old sites, and are sold atso much per pound as "fossil ivory" to crews of visiting boats or tomerchants at Nome and elsewhere, to be worked up into beads, pendants,and other objects of semi-jewelry that find ready sale among the whites.In addition a certain part of these objects is reserved by the natives,especially those of the Diomede Islands, and worked up by themselves.The more striking the coloration of the ivory, the more desirable it isfor the beads, etc., and the less chance of the object, regardless ofits archeological or artistic value, to be preserved. The most artisticpieces, nevertheless, are usually disposed of separately, bringinghigher prices than could be obtained for beads.In this way hundreds of pounds collectively of ancient implements,statuettes, etc., are recovered each year from the old sites onboth the Asiatic and the American side of the Bering Sea, and arecut up, their scientific value being lost. Most of the fossilivory, fortunately, consists of objects which, though showing man'sworkmanship, are of relatively little scientific value; neverthelessit was seen repeatedly that specimens of real archeological value andartistic interest would be destroyed if their color and texture madethem suitable for some of the higher-priced jewelry.The Eskimo, as repeatedly found later, have not the slightesthesitation about excavating the old sites, and whatever they can notuse, which as a rule includes animal and human bones, and in facteverything else except stone tools and ivory, is left in the excavatedsoil and lost. The amount of destruction thus accomplished by thewomen, children, and even men each year is large and promises to growfrom year to year as long as the supply lasts. This means that unlessscientific exploration of these old sites is hastened there will belittle left before long to study.The fossil ivory trade has become such that many of the officers andthe crews even of the visiting vessels, including the revenue cutters,engage in buying the ivory from the natives and cutting it up in theirspare time into beads and other ornaments. A captain of a well-knownboat who with his crew visited in the summer of 1926 a small island onwhich there is an extensive frozen refuse heap containing many bonesand tools of the natives who once occupied the place, exclaimed, "Gad,there's $50,000 of ivory in sight."The boat crew took away about "2 bushels" of it, or all that could beremoved from the extensive frozen pile. I saw some of this ivory later,all cut up, but with a number of the pieces still showing old humanhandiwork, and some beads made of other parts of the lot were broughtlater to my office in Washington.If American archeology and ethnology are to learn what they need inthese regions it is absolutely essential that they take early stepsfor a proper exploration of the old sites, besides which every effortshould be made by the intelligent traders, missionaries, teachers, andofficials to save the more artistic and characteristic pieces of humanworkmanship in the old ivory, and bring them with such data as may beavailable to the attention of scientific men or institutions. It wouldin fact be of much value, and the writer has suggested this to theGovernor of Alaska, to establish a local museum at Nome, where suchobjects could be gathered and saved to science.ABORIGINAL REMAINSThe coast of which Nome is now the human center, up to Cape Wales,together with the nearer islands, was occupied by the Maiglemiut(Zagoskin), or Mahlemut (Dall et al.) subdivision of the Eskimo. Theywere a strong group, and great traders. During the Russian times theAziags, from what is now the Sledge Island, with probably others fromthe coast, visited yearly for trading purposes as far as St. Michaeland the Yukon, while the Wales people were known to trade up to fairlyrecently as far as Kotzebue, both at the same time having tradingconnections with Asia.Of these natives, with the exception of those at Wales, there remainsbut little. On Sledge Island there are only two dead villages, and onthe coast from Port Clarence to far east of Nome there is not a singleexisting native settlement. A few remnants of the people live in Nome,but they have lost all individuality.Dead sites are known to exist from west to east, at Cape Wooley; atthe mouth of the Sonora or Quartz Creek; at the mouth of the PennyRiver--some natives are said to still go to fish there in summer; atthe mouth of a small river 3 miles east of Nome; both west (a largervillage) and east (a small site) of Cape Nome; and 18 miles east ofNome (the "Nook" village).Most of these sites have been peopled within the memory of the oldestinhabitants.Thanks to the kind aid of the Reverend Doctor Baldwin, I was able tovisit several of the sites east of Nome, more particularly the Nookvillage, and it was still possible to find two skeletons and a skull onthese sites.The Nook site must have been one of considerable importance. Itwas an especially large village, or rather two near-by villages,in one of which I counted upward of 30 depressions, remnants ofthe semisubterranean houses with vestibules, such as are elsewheredescribed from the Yukon.Here a clear illustration was had of what changes on sites of thisnature may be wrought in a short time by the elements.Fifteen years ago, I was assured, there were still many burials andskeletal remains scattered along the coast near the Nook village.Then in 1913 came a great southwestern storm, which at Nome ripped upthe cemetery and carried away some coffins with bodies, scatteringthem over the plains in the vicinity. Since that storm not a vestigeremains of any of the burials or bones near the large Nook village.On prolonged examination I found nothing but sands overgrown with theusual coast vegetation. Everything had been carried away or buried andthe pits of the houses were evidently themselves largely filled in.The burials on this coast west of Golovnin Bay were evidently all ofa simpler nature than those on Norton Sound and the Yukon. There isplenty of driftwood, but for some reason this was not hewn into boardswith which to make burial boxes. The dead were merely laid upon andcovered with the driftwood, though this was done, as later seen onGolovnin Bay, rather ingeniously. One of the two skeletons found nearCape Nome, an adult male, lay simply among the rocks on the lower partof the slope of the hill.Old sites, though often small, may be confidently looked for along allthese coasts in the shelter of every promontory, at the mouth of eachstream, and on the spits which separate the ocean from inland lagoons(as in the case of the Nook village).NOME--BERING STRAIT--BARROWFriday, July 23. Received word to be on the _Bear_, which arrivedyesterday, before 10 o'clock this morning. Due to the shallowness ofthe water the boat, though drawing only 18 feet, stands far out fromthe shore and makes a pretty sight, looks also quite large in thesewaters where there is nothing above a few hundred tons.Am soon at home. The captain's cabin, with three beds, is nicelyfurnished, but has the disadvantage of being situated at the very rearof the vessel, above and beyond the screw. There is another passenger,a teacher-nurse for Barrow. I take the isolated bunk on the right, andthis becomes my corner for the next six weeks. Toward 11 a. m. the windbegins to freshen, soon after which we leave for St. Lawrence Island.After midday the wind increases considerably, waves rise, and the_Bear_ begins to plunge. Before the afternoon is over the wind blows ahalf gale and we are being tossed about a great deal. Have to take tobed. The boat is being tossed up and down and in all directions. Resistin vain, then at last become ill, and this passes into a long spell ofabout the worst seasickness I have ever endured. There were a good manysick on the _Bear_ that evening and night.Saturday, July 24. Wind and water slowly quieting down, and the boatis approaching Cape Chibukak off St. Lawrence Island, where is locatedthe main of the two villages of the island, known as Gambell. The_Bear_ gradually approaches to within about a half mile of the shore,where we anchor. The water here is quieter, and before long a largebaidar (native skin boat) is shoved off from the land and approachesour boat. This is the usual procedure when the sea permits. There areno docks, and closer in there is danger from rocks and shallows. Thereare a number of natives in the boat, together with the local teacher,and each one, including the teacher, carries a smaller or larger bagof fossil ivory, various articles made of fresh ivory, and some otherobjects, for sale to the officers and crew of the boat. They climb onour deck, where they evidently feel quite at home, and in a few minutescarry on a busy trade and barter with everyone. I succeed in gettinga fine fossil ivory pick; but the main supply had evidently beenpreempted and I only see it later in the possession of the officers,who kindly let me have what is of less value to them and more toscience.Some of the Eskimo bring, in addition to the ivory, other articlesfor sale--fish, birds, and the meat of the reindeer, which are forthe ship's messes and constitute very welcome additions to the diet.Besides all this the natives also frequently bring skins of foxes andeven bear, which also find buyers. In return the boats carry off themail and such supplies as they have obtained by barter or purchase.These visits are mutually enjoyable as well as profitable occasions,and afford one the opportunity of seeing many of the natives, even ifprevented, as in this case, from visiting their village.The Eskimo impress one here as in every further locality as a lively,cheerful, and intelligent lot, good traders, and advancing in manyways in civilization. The latter is perhaps especially true of the St.Lawrence Eskimo, who from what was seen now and later must have hadespecially good missionaries and teachers as well as a considerablefreedom from bad influences from the outside.SAVONGAAbout 40 miles east-southeast of Gambell is the second and smallervillage of the St. Lawrence Island, known as Savonga, which was theobject of our next visit. It was here that we were to buy two or threereindeer carcasses, the animals being killed and dressed for us by thenatives in an astonishingly short time. The little village is prettilysituated on the green flat of the elevated beach. It consists of lessthan a dozen modern small frame dwellings. One of these, that of theheadman, Sapilla (who regrettably died during the following winter),is of two stories--a unique feature for an Eskimo dwelling in thesewaters. Here we were visited by three boats and the previous sceneswere repeated, only, due to the proximity of a rich old site, therewere more objects of old ivory.The captain made me acquainted with Sapilla, whom I found remarkablywhite-man-like in behavior. Then the ship doctor, not feeling very wellafter yesterday's storm, filled my pockets with tooth forceps and I wastaken to the shore, to see the women and children who would not ventureout and to attend to any tooth extraction that might be needed.We were considerably farther from the shore than even at Gambell,but I was sent on one of our motor boats and so it did not take longto land. Upon landing we came to bright and clean and smiling littlegroups of women and children, full of color in their cotton dresses,and I was soon in one of their houses. All these dwellings were builtby the Eskimo themselves, and it was a most gratifying surprise to findthem as clean and wholesome as any similar dwelling of whites couldbe. Moreover, these houses were furnished with stoves, chairs, tables,crockery and other utensils exactly as if they were those of a goodclass of whites, with the smell of the seal, which as a rule is soclinging to and characteristic of the Eskimo house, barely perceptible.It was a busy and interesting hour that I spent at Savonga. I sawprobably all the inhabitants that were at home; pulled five teeth--theteeth of these quite civilized people are no more as sound and solidas were those of their fathers and mothers--and found and purchasedcheaply many smaller objects of fossil ivory, which they excavate froma near-by old site.These objects are obtained from an old village located on the coastabout 4 miles farther east, on or near the North Cape, visible fromour boat. The natives excavate in this site as far as it thaws everysummer, and find many objects. They, moreover, make an occasional tripto the two little rocky Punuk islands located about 12 miles south ofthe East Cape of the St. Lawrence, which, though accurately charted bythe Russians as early as 1849, yet until the summer of 1926 remainedpractically unknown. On one of these islands there is now known toexist an extensive frozen refuse heap, containing large quantities ofold ivory implements as well as other objects of scientific interest.The land visit was a great tonic after the wild and mean precedingnight, and I did not relish at all the _Bear's_ whistle calling usaway. What a great thing it would be if a revenue cutter could for justone season be given to science!Sunday, July 25. Left St. Lawrence 9.30 last night, sea quieting. Weare now passing, on our right, King Island, isolated rocky mass. Dayfair, cool, water getting smooth.About 50 miles north one can now see plainly Cape Prince of Wales (pl.5, _a_), and to the left, hazy, the two Diomedes. We are now 95 milesfrom St. Lawrence. On really clear days one could see from here eventhe Asiatic heights. Therefore, from the latter on a clear day one seesthe Diomedes, the Cape, the highlands beyond, and King Island, while alittle farther south there is on such a day a good view from Asia ofthe St. Lawrence Island. All this was in good weather easily reachedfrom Asia and must have been utilized from the earliest time in passingonward from one continent to the other.We can now see also much of the coast in the direction of Teller andthe York Mountains behind.From hour to hour there is growing on one a profound appreciationthat the Bering Sea was a most favorable amphitheater of migration,particularly from the less hospitable Asia eastward into America. Andpractically the whole trend of native movements to this day is fromAsia toward America.Later in the day, now a fine, bright summer day, arrive off Wales.Here again anchor far out. Last year the _Bear_ grounded here andour captain is apprehensive. Wales is a straggly village--or twovillages--located on a large, flat sandy spit, dotted with waterpools, and projecting from the Seward Peninsula toward Asia. Near byare old sites, probably of much archeological value, and in these forsome weeks now excavations have been carried on by Dr. D. Jenness,of the Victoria Memorial Museum of Ottawa. Here also is located anexceptionally educated and observant teacher, Mr. Clark M. Garber.A big umiak comes to us with many natives bringing the usual trade, andon it, much to my pleasure, are both Doctor Jenness and Mr. Garber.Doctor Jenness asks to go with us to the Little Diomede to do some workthere. He has had encouraging experience here, finding evidences ofoccupation dating many centuries back, and has collected some valuablespecimens, including a few with the fine old curved-line decoration.Mr. Garber gives me some valuable information about the skeletalremains of this place and engages to collect for me, who can not leavethe boat, a few boxes of these specimens, which promise is fulfilledlater.The natives are a jolly and sturdy lot, even though they bear, and thatsince their earliest contacts with whites, a rather bad reputation.That this is founded in some fact, at least, is told us in the annalsof the Russians, and is also shown by the little structure on thehillside off which we are anchored. This has a tragic and at the sametime quaint history. It is the grave of a missionary Doctor Thornton,who was killed, we are told, by two local young fellows. These wereapprehended, sentenced to die, and were to be shot by their relatives,which all evidently found quite just. On the appointed day they weretaken out to the burial ground, helped to prepare their burials, oneasked yet to be allowed to go to the village to get a drink, went andreturned, and then both were shot. The executioner of the boy who wentto get the drink is said to have been his uncle.THE DIOMEDESLate that night we leave slowly for the Diomede Islands, the nearerof which is only about 18 miles distant. The two islands lie, as iswell known, just about in the middle of the Bering Strait. One isknown as the larger or Russian, the other as the smaller or AmericanDiomede. The boundary line between Russia and the United States passesbetween the two. Both islands have been occupied since far back by theEskimo. To-day there is one small village on the American and two smallsettlements on the Russian island.July 26. Up at 5.40, breakfast 6, and off in one of our staunch motorboats, with Jenness, for the Little Diomede. Countless birds flying instreams about the island.The island is just a big rock, with barren flat top and steep sides,covered where inclination permits with great numbers of larger andsmaller granite bowlders. There is neither tree nor brush here. Thevillage, if it deserves that name, with a school, occupies an easierslope, facing the larger island across a strait seemingly about amile broad. There are but a few dwellings, due to local necessitiesand conditions built above ground and outside of stone. One that wasentered showed a dark fore-room, a storage attic, and a cozy somewhatlighted living and sleeping back room, entered through a low and narrowentrance. The houses seem to be built on old débris of habitations, andthere are refuse heaps, one of which was eventually worked in by DoctorJenness, though without much profit.The bowlder-covered slope above the village was the burial ground ofthe natives. (Pl. 5, _b_.) Unfortunately most of the skeletal remainshave been collected by a former teacher and then left and lost. WithDoctor Jenness and the present teacher, himself an Eskimo, we climbfrom bowlder to bowlder and collect what remains. The work is bothrisky to the limbs and difficult in other respects. The large bowldersare piled up many deep; and there being little or no soil, there areall sorts of holes and crevices between and underneath the stones. Deepin these crevices, completely out of sight or reach, nest innumerablebirds (the little auk), and their chatter is heard everywhere. But intothese impenetrable crevices also have fallen many of the bones andskulls of the bodies that have been "buried" among the bowlders, andalso doubtless many of the smaller articles laid by the bodies.The burials here were made in any suitable space among the rocks. Thebody was laid in this space, without any coffin and evidently not muchclothing. About it and on the rocks above were placed various articles.We found clay lamps, remnants of various wooden objects, the bone endpieces of lances, and finally one or two pieces of driftwood to markthe place. Here the bodies decayed and what was left had either tumbledor was washed by rain into the crevices. It was suggested, however,that much may have been taken by dogs and foxes. Some of the skullsand here and there one of the larger bones remained, to eventually becovered by moss and eroded. With the help of Doctor Jenness and theteacher I was able to find five male and seven female crania in faircondition, which will be of much value in the study of this interestingcontingent of the Eskimo.No evidence in the graveyard among the rocks of any great antiquity,nothing more than perhaps a few scores of years. But traces of olderburials would surely be completely lost among the rocks, though theymay lie in the deep crevices and holes where they can not be reached.Upon return am treated to a cup of good hot coffee--never can geta real hot cup of coffee on the boat--and excellent bread, made bythe Eskimo wife of the teacher; and see his family of fine chubbychildren. Can not help but kiss his girl of about 10--she is so freshand innocent and pretty. Obtain also from the wife of the teacher agood old hafted "jade" ax, though she hesitates much to part withit--it used to belong to her grandmother; and from the teacherhimself a number of interesting articles in old ivory. Leave DoctorJenness. Have learned to like him much, both for his careful work andpersonally, in our short association; and at 11 a. m. return to theboat.Cold, but calm and sunny. Sit on boxes at the very end of the good old_Bear_. See Asia, the two Diomedes, and Seward Peninsula, all in easyreach, all like so many features of a big lake. Pass around GreaterDiomede.There never could have been any large settlement on the DiomedeIslands--they are not fit for it. The Great Diomede has just twomediocre sites, which are occupied now each by about half a dozendwellings. A small old settlement, a few stone houses, has also onceexisted, I am told, on the elevated top of the larger island oppositethe Little Diomede. On the latter only the one visited--everywhere elsethe steep slopes or walls come right down into the water, and thereis even no landing possible (or only a precarious one at best) exceptwhere we landed. The old natives of the Little Diomede are said to havebelieved that another village had once existed farther out from thepresent site and that it has become submerged. The evidence cited (toldby the native teacher) is not conclusive, and no indication of sucha settlement could be seen from the beach. But in front and possiblybeneath the native houses, in the old refuse, there may be remnants ofolder dwellings.Just passed from Monday to Tuesday, and then back to Monday, all in afew hours--the day boundary. We are now just north of the Bering Straitand see all beautifully, in moderate bluish haze.A grand panorama of utmost anthropological interest. A big lake, sceneof one of the main migrational episodes of mankind. Sea just wrinklingsome, day calm, mostly sunny, mildly pleasant, with an undertone ofcold.How trivial feel here the contentions about the possibilities ofAsiatic migrations into America. There can be no such problem withthose who have seen what we now are witnessing. Here is a great openpond which on such days as this could be traversed by anyone having asmuch as a decent canoe. As a matter of fact it has always been and isstill thus traversed. (Pl. 6, _a_.) The Chukchee carried on a largetrade with America, so much so that we find the Russians complainingof their interfering with their trade. (Pl. 6, _b_, _c_.) The Diomedepeople stand in connection on one hand with the northeastern Asiaticsand on the other hand with the whites as far as Nome, where most ofthem go every summer to sell their ivory and its products and bringback all sorts of provisions. And in the same way the King Islanderscome every summer to Nome, on the east end of which, as the Diomedes onthe west, they have their summer habitations. (Pl. 7, _a_, _b_.) Onlya year or two ago, the natives tell, an Eskimo woman of St. LawrenceIsland set out alone in a canoe with her child to visit a cousin on theAsiatic coast, 50 miles distant, and returned safe and sound after thevisit was over.[Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 5_a_, Cape Prince of Wales from the southeast.

H., 1926.)]To bed dressed--the captain tells me we shall soon be at Shishmaref,on the north shore of the Seward Peninsula, and that he will have mecalled, if I want to visit the village.Awake 11.30 p. m. At 11.45 word comes that we have arrived and a boatis getting ready. On deck in five minutes. Of course it is stilllight--there is no real night any more in these regions.Have a cinnamon roll--the night specialty for the crew on the_Bear_--and a bowl of coffee. The natives, two boats full, alreadycoming, and a fine full-blooded lot they show themselves to be. Theyare accompanied by Mr. Wegner, a big, pleasant young teacher.Leave natives trading and set off in ship's boat. The _Bear_ isanchored about 1⅓ miles off. Fortunately fairly quiet or we should notbe able to go ashore. Teacher and a young English-speaking native gowith us. We have the launch and the skin whaleboat. Anchor first offshallow beach and transfer into the skin boat for the landing.Tuesday, July 27. It is about 12.30 a. m. Many native women,youngsters, and some men gather about us at the school. Talk tothem--explain what I want, which is mainly skulls and bones--all quiteagreed. Take two young natives, some bags, and proceed to where theylead me.Find, about half a mile from the present village, a big and importantold site, which existed up to the white man's time. But dunes onwhich burials were made and house sites have been largely gradedby a fox-farm keeper and trader, Mr. Goshaw. He had gathered manyskulls--shows me a photo of two rows, at least 40--will not tell whathe did with them. Says he sent "many things to the Smithsonian," butcan give no details, "and to the universities," but will not mentionwhich. Also "buried a lot." Bad business.Gathering what is possible from the débris thrown out by the Eskimoworking for the fox farm, we proceed rapidly from mound (dune) tomound. Find burials still on the surface in situ--i. e., nearlyburied by the rising carpet of the vegetation--but skulls gone. Manyof those on remaining heaps imperfect, but at least something can besaved. Collect all that is worth collecting. See Mr. Goshaw--get butlittle out of him. Donates a few archeological specimens of no greatvalue--has no more.We hurry on to the other village and burial ground, almost a mile westof the present settlement. Find only a small pile of bones, with onewhole male skeleton of fairly recent date.Then back, as fast as possible, the Indians carrying the bags withbones, and load on boat. My shoes and feet have long since becomethoroughly wet, after which Mr. Wegner loaned me wool socks and nativeshoes that protected my feet. But now these must be left behind and Ihave to get into my wet, cold shoes--socks too wet. Officers in a hurryto get back. It is now 3.00 a. m.; the sun rose about 1.30. Pay my men,change shoes, photograph women (pl. 8) and then men--all pleasant andwilling. See a few poor articles of archeological nature--not worthgetting; and after a hearty handshake with the teacher we take offthrough the somewhat rougher water to the whaleboat, then on to themotor boat and the ship. Arrive with six bags of specimens, reachingboat just a little after 4. Sleepy captain meets us, but luckily showsno grudge, though this stop and his loss of sleep were essentiallyfor me. Though it would seem they could have readily waited for ourgoing ashore until morning, or have given me a little more time at theDiomedes, which would have brought us here later. Am too much awake nowand worked up to sleep. Lie down a while but fully awake. Total sleeplast night 2½ hours. But it was worth it, except for the vandalism.Pack--inadequate boxes--until 3.30 p. m. Whole collection made lastnight put in order. But back and knees stiff. Weather two-thirds fair(my own estimate), some wind, sea choppy. Lie down but can not sleep.At 5.30 off Kotzebue. Due to shallowness of water must anchor far outof sight. At 6 go to land in ship's larger launch. Waves rather bad,much tossing about and spray, have to get behind the canvas canopythat is raised over one seat. It is 15 miles from where the _Bear_ isanchored to the Kotzebue village--over two hours of (at times) ratherviolent tossing up and down and sidewise. Run for a part of the timenot far from beach--a number of isolated, orderly fish camps--lots offish drying. Wonder at not getting seasick again--it must be the openair or difference of movement.Kotzebue village lies around a point on a not very high, flat bank,facing the bay of three rivers (Selavik, Kobuk, Noatak). As we approachI count over 50 clean tents of Eskimos, about 15 frame houses andstores, and many skin and other boats on beach or in water. Manynatives hurry to meet us.Go ashore. Thomas Berryman, the trader, with the local judge and twoor three other whites come also to meet us. After getting acquaintedinquire about possibility of exploring the Kobuk and reaching theKoyukuk and Yukon. But all that I learn is uncertain and discouraging.There are but few native villages on the river, all Eskimo; and higherup the water is rapid, necessitating much hauling of the boat bythe natives, which is costly; upon which follow three or four days'portage. The trip would cost much, and no loads over 40 pounds to a mancould be carried.Only a few old sites hereabouts are known by those whom I have a chanceto ask. Say there is a somewhat important one at Cape Krusenstern.Mr. Berryman has from there a big stone (slate) lance. He also has ahuge piece of serpentine, over 80 pounds in weight, with a moderatedepression in top and some cutting (old native work), said to havebeen used as a lamp. Wants to keep this and spearhead, but donates anold rusty tin box full of smaller things and promises to obtain skullsfor us; and I get a similar promise from a man (probably one of Mr.Berryman's storekeepers) from farther up the country.Later meet here Mr. Chance, the school superintendent of these parts;a young and not prepossessing man, but one who steadily improves oncloser acquaintance. Learn from him of a skeleton recently dug out fromthe ground under the schoolhouse.See many natives, all Eskimo, good looking, clean, and kind. Somemix bloods, but the majority pure. Good to moderate stature, wellproportioned though not fat body, medium to somewhat lighter browncolor, physiognomies less typical Eskimo than hitherto and oftenstrongly like Indian. Too late and dusky to photograph.Go to see the teacher and find that the skeleton he dug out was placedby him in an open box, pushed as far as possible under the rafters ofthe floor of the schoolhouse and covered with gravel and earth. Thereare four of us--start hurriedly digging for it, remove with shovel, hoeand arms about a ton of the "filling"--and can not reach the box. It is10 p. m., the wind rising, officer comes and urges me to get back tothe boat. So must leave with promise that the box will be gotten outand await me on our return from the north. Have by this time decidedthe best policy will be to go with the _Bear_ as far as she may go.Load empty boxes, some packing--and one of the young white men who havebeen digging with us runs up from the distant schoolhouse announcingthat they "struck" the box. Urge him to run back as fast as he canand get it. Luckily the postmaster and a good many others who came tosee us off delay us; also the transfer of the mail and boxes to thelarger boat. Finally, after a good many anxious looks, I see at lastthe two young men appear, one with a wheelbarrow on which is the boxof bones. Bones look not very old, and Eskimoid at first sight, buttake box, which contains a good deal of gravel, carry it through thevery interested Eskimo to the boat, all get in, hurried good-bys toeverybody, and we are off.A two and a half hours' trip once more, and the last more than half ofit very rough. Such tossing and dancing and dipping and twisting, withthe spray, fortunately not cold, shooting high up at times, or an angrywave splashing over. But the boat is large and strong and so eventuallywe reach the _Bear_, which was completely out of sight until about anhour after we started, and in a few minutes off we go to the north. Alittle fruit, bed, and know nothing more until near 7 the next morning.It was a long day--over 25 hours in a stretch without a wink. Yet didnot feel bad; the work and good nature of people about and those metwith, with some success, are good tonics.Wednesday, July 28. All of us have to consult the calendar to be sureof the day and date.Sort and wash Berryman's specimens--a nice lot of little things, mainlyof stone, slate, flint, etc.Then go after my bones. Find the spray made the earth and gravel in thebox thoroughly wet, so that it is necessary carefully to excavate allthe bones. Find a male, rather short-statured, typically Eskimo. Mayhave been a burial of the Russian times. Wire for all details. Mustdry bones. Meanwhile try to catch up with notes. Toward evening expectto be in another village. Weather fair. Have passed the Arctic Circleduring night, but it is not cold nor in any way strange here. Sunsetcoloring lasts long and passes into that of sunrise--no real night, nostars; but moon seen late at night and far to the south.May this weather continue, for in rough weather landing at any of theseplaces--there are no harbors whatever and always shallows and bars andshoals--would be extremely risky or impossible and my work, for whichI feel ever more eager, would suffer. If only I could see all worthseeing, and stay a little longer when I find what I am after.We reach Kevalina. It is just a schoolhouse and about seven sod houses.Only a native school teacher, from whom I do not get much.No remains or old site very near, but an old village, with "good manythings," exists on the Kevalina River within a few hours' distance (bycanoe) from Kevalina.Natives bring old adzes (mounted by them, however), and a harpoonhandle from the old site--bought.Spend rest of day in washing, sorting, and packing specimens.After supper am invited to the officers' room and given by Lieut. M.C. Anderson a fine selection of old ivory harpoon heads and otherthings. Many of these are from the old site on the St. Lawrence Island,and especially from little isles off that island named Punuk. All thisstrengthens the importance of those islands for regular exploration.Thursday, July 29. In anticipation of being called up again during thenight, at Point Hope, which is evidently another important spot forarcheological exploration, for the natives are said to bring many oldarticles for sale each year, I do not undress and go to bed earlier,but have, because of the anticipation, closeness of air, and a catjumping on my face just as I am dozing off, a very poor night; and nocall came after all. In the morning there are cold showers, the sky ismuch clouded, and the wind keeps on blowing from the north-northwest,threatening, the officers say, to drive the ice toward this shore,which would be bad for us. It is cool and disagreeable. We haveanchored to the south of the spit on which stands the village and cannot unload or get ashore. Nor can the natives come here to us.The village consists of a schoolhouse, a little mission (Rev. F. W.Goodman), an accumulation of houses, semi-subterraneans, and tents. Afew tents are also seen a good distance to the right--a reindeer camp.Otherwise there is nothing but the long, low, sandy, and grassy spitprojecting far out into the ocean.Later. The north-northwest still blows, and so the ship has to anchorto the south of the long spit on the point of which is the village. Ofthis but little can be seen, just a few houses, and it seems near andinsignificant.The captain is evidently waiting again for the natives to come out, andI am helpless. Finally, however, a boat is made ready and I am takento the shore with the mail. This is piled on the beach, and with twoofficers we start to walk toward the dwellings opposite to us, whichare the mission. Heavy walking in the loose sand and gravel of thesteep beach, and as we ascend it is seen the buildings which seemed sonear to the shore are about a mile or more away.A man coming toward us--the missionary, Archdeacon Goodman. Tell himmy mission; says he has some business on the ship, but will come, andthere will be no trouble in helping me to a "good deal of what I want,"which sounds fine.In the absence of the missionary, go to see the teacher. The school isover a mile in the direction toward the point. Find him at home andhelpful. In 15 minutes, with his aid, engage two native boys, give twosacks to each, and send them out over the long flats (old beaches) topick up every skull and jaw they can find. They go cheerfully, and wedepart shortly after to see Mr. La Voy, a movie-picture man, who hasbeen staying here for some time making movie pictures of the natives,and at the same time collecting all the antiquities they could bringhim. We go to see his collection, but find him not home; has gone formail. The rare mail in these regions is, of course, the most importantof events. So back to the school (a good many rods from the sod housepart of the native village to the left), and then--it is now nearnoon--to the mission, a good mile from the school and more from thevillage.Road staked on one side with whale ribs about 2 rods distance. Flatson both sides show many parts of bleached human bones. They are a partof the old extensive burial grounds. Unfortunately, about two yearsago the predecessor of the present missionary had most of the skullsand bones collected and put in a hole in the new cemetery, now seenin the distance to the right of the mission. This new burial placeis surrounded by a unique whale-rib fence. Reach mission, but no onethere. Does not look good. Try one building and door after another--noone--learn later that the missionary has no family. Twenty minutes to1. Nothing remains but to go back to the school for some lunch. Soleave my raincoat, camera, and remaining bags (expecting to do mainwork on the buried bones) and hurry back to the school, which I reachjust after 1, and, thanks to their late clock, just in time for amodest lunch, but with a real hot cup of coffee. Queer that the onlygenuinely hot cups of coffee I got on this journey were furnished byEskimo--for Mrs. Moyer, the wife of the teacher, is an Eskimo.Then comes the mail and Mr. La Voy, and I go to see the latter'scollection.Find a mass of old and modern material, of stone, bone, and wood.All the older things are from an old site on the point. It is animportant and large site, as found later (at least 50 houses), whichthe natives (getting coffee, tea, chewing gum, chocolate, candy,etc., for what they find) are now busy digging over and ruining forscientific exploration. Women dig as well as men, confining themselvesto from 2 to 3 uppermost feet that have thawed; but even thus findinga lot of specimens. Bones, of course, and other things are left and noobservation whatever on the site is made. It is a pity.Mr. La Voy donates some stone objects, mainly scrapers, and then I gowith a native he employs to the "diggings." Find much already turnedover--one woman actually digging--but very much more still remaining.Examine everything--site evidently not ancient but of the richest--andthen return with the woman to get some of her "cullings."On the way am called by a man whose sod house (semisubterranean) wepass. We sit on the top of his house and soon establish a regulartrading place, with a big flat stone as a counter. One after anotherthe native women and men bring out a few articles, good, bad, orindifferent, lay them on the stone, I select what I want, lay so muchmoney against the articles, and usually get them. Everybody in the bestof humor. The natives surely enjoy the sport, and so do I, if only Iwas not hurried. Thus trade for at least an hour until my pockets arebulging. Then once more to the school and once more to the mission. Inthe latter get my things, as nobody is there yet, Doctor Goodman havingdoubtless been delayed on the boat. I hear that there are prospectsof both him and Mr. La Voy going north with us on a little vacation.Send the coat with spare bags to the school by a native I meet, while Igo to look at the rib cemetery and photograph it. Find the bones havebeen interred in its middle and a low mound raised over them, so thereis for the moment nothing to do there. Therefore go over the plain alittle farther, picking up a few odds and ends, a damaged skull, andfinally, from a fairly recent burial box, a fine skull with its lowerjaw. Then attempt to pass a pool of water and sink in the mud to abovemy rubber boots, so that the icy water runs in, wetting me thoroughly,and gurgling henceforth with every step in the shoes. Try to get theseoff but can not. The feet must be congested. So spill out all I can byraising the feet, and then do some hard walking which takes away thecold.Evening, though no dusk approaching. Sit on gravel to empty morewater from shoes, but can still hardly get one off. And just as Isucceed I see, across another long pool, two men, one with a cap ofan officer of the ship, waving their arms, evidently signifying tome that the time is up and I am to return. Call to them to wait.Impossible to make them hear me or for me to hear them. All here iselusive--enchanted-like--distances, sounds. Finally they stop. I catchup with them after passing a broad ditch, and learn that the shipis about to sail and they are waiting for me. My coat, however, andcollections are still at the school, over a mile away, so once moreit is necessary to hurry to the school and then back to the ship. Sothings go when promises go wrong and one is alone under a constantapprehension.The boys collected four bags full. Moreover, they undertook to bringthem toward the boat, and are bringing the last two just as I approachthe beach. There are Eskimos on the beach with dog teams and sledgeswaiting to cart off what was unloaded from the ship. Photograph oneof the teams and then on into the boat and to the _Bear_ with thefour bags, a box full, part of another bag, and all pockets full ofspecimens. Only to learn when we reach the boat that both DoctorGoodman and Mr. La Voy are going with us and that the former aftersupper is still to go and get his things from the mission. I have noboat to go back with, and so lose several hours.July 30. Gloomy morning, windy, cool, sea not good. Do not feel easy.But need to pack. One of the officers, Boatswain Berg, lends me hisshort sheepskin coat, and I pack up to lunch. The sea is getting worse.Have but little lunch and soon after have to take to bed or would againbe sick. To avoid the pitching of the end of the boat where my bed isI go to the dispensary and lie until 6. From 6 on the sea moderatessomewhat, so that I am able to have a little supper. After that go toofficers' wardroom, play two games of checkers with the doctor, getsome more specimens from two of the officers, and retire.When I boarded the _Bear_ it became plain to me that I must earn asmuch as possible the sympathetic understanding of my work by both theofficers and the crew, and so I gave two talks, one to the officers andthe other to the men, telling them of our problems in Alaska, of themeaning and value of such collections as I was making, and of othermatters that I felt would be useful on this occasion. As a result I hadthroughout the voyage nothing but the friendliest feelings of all andtheir cooperation. Sincere thanks to the officers and the crew of the_Bear_, from the captain downward.Saturday, July 31. At 4.30 a. m. suddenly a heavy bump forward,followed by several smaller ones. Ship rises and shivers. Have struckice floes. Going very slowly. Further bumps at longer or shorterintervals and occasionally the ship stops entirely. Sea fortunatelymuch calmer.Up at 7. We are in a loose field of ice--aquamarine-blue ice coveredwith hillocks of snow, all shapes and sizes, as after a hard winter onthe Hudson, only floes mostly larger and especially deeper.Soon after breakfast hear walrus and seals had been observed on theice, and shortly before 9 the captain comes down hurriedly to tell usthey have just spied--they now have a man in the crow's nest up on theforemast--a white bear.Run up--everybody pleasurably excited--to the front of the ship. See ablack-looking head of something swimming toward a large ice floe about500 yards in front of us. As we approach the head reaches the floe,then a big yellowish paw comes out upon the ice, then the shoulders,and finally the whole bear. The officers hurry forward, each with agun. Soon men all there. Some one fires. Bear stands broadside watchingus. The bullet goes way over. Then other shots--still missing--waterspouting high in many places. Bear bewildered, does not know what todo, lopes off a little here and there, stops again, looking at us, andnow--we are less than 100 yards from him it seems--a bullet strikes himabove the loin--we can see him jerk and the red spot following. Heruns clumsily, but other shots follow, some seemingly taking effect,and then he drops, first on his belly, then, twisting, turns over onhis back. A few more movements with his paws and head, and he liesstill, quite dead. Can not but feel sorry for the poor bear, who didnot know why he was being killed, and had no chance.A motor boat is lowered and goes to get him. They find on the floe theremains of a seal on which he fed. Tie a rope to him, drag him into thewater, tow him to the _Bear_, which has stopped and where all standon the bows in expectation and with all sorts of cameras, and prepareto hoist the brute aboard. Captain says it is the second case of thisnature in 20 years. Ropes are fastened about the big body, attached toa winch, and the big limp form is hauled up, though not without somedifficulty, due to its size and weight. All stand about him, examine,photograph. They will let the natives at Wainwright skin it and givethem the flesh. It is a middle-sized, full-grown male. It shows onlytwo wounds, the one in the side and one where the bullet passed throughhis mouth, knocking out one of the canines.Cold--must put on second suit of underwear. Very gloomy, but stormabated. No land in sight--above Cape Lombard all is flat. It rains inthat direction. We meander among the floes, now and then bumping andshivering. Should a wind come up and blow the ice landward we would bein danger of being closed in and stopped or delayed.Evening. Arrive off Wainwright. Village recent--older site 20 milesaway. People the usual type of Eskimo. Visit the village, but soonreturn.After supper the boat stops--fear the ice. Another passenger is addedhere, Jim Allen, the local trader, with a bagful of white fox skins anda bear skin. Conditions becoming a bit crowded.Sunday, August 1. No movement to-day. They are apprehensive of theice, and so we stay here, the one place of all where there is nothingfor me to do. Of course there are the natives, but with the constantuncertainty as to when we shall start and a lack of facilities I cannot do much with them.The weather is quiet but still cloudy, though the sun may possibly peepout. Ice seen in the offing. Would be more interesting to be in it, asyesterday. The bear has been skinned, cut up, and we shall try some ofits flesh at noon. Rest of day quiet but still mostly cloudy, thoughoccasionally a little of pale, lukewarm sun. At 3.30 give lectureto the officers and fellow passengers on the subject of evolution.Seems quite appreciated. Reading, writing, and walking the deck fillsthe time. Ate a little of the bear meat--somewhat tough, otherwisenot much different from reindeer or even beef. If better prepared(especially roasted on coals) would be quite palatable.Yesterday there were several flurries of snow, none to-day, but aircold enough to make a long stay outside disagreeable.Toward evening Captain announces that he is going to try to reachBarrow, about 80 miles northeastward, and soon after supper we start.He also tells me we may be there at or not long after midnight and soto be ready, for the boat will be unable to stop more than an hour ortwo. As the only place where a few skulls and bones may be found isabout 1½ miles outside of the village and it takes a good 30 minutes tomake a mile over the tundras, I shall have to rush once more. But I ampromised a man to help me.August 2. With clothes on, and anticipation, slept poorly. Ship stoppedabout 1 a. m. and I imagined we were off Barrow. But on rising findthat we have gone on and then backward again, encountering ever moreice. It is cold and foggy outside, and cloudy and gloomy. We nowmeander among the big floes, now and then bump into one until the wholeship heaves and shivers, and occasionally the siren, stop for a whileto diminish the shock. We are now on way back to Wainwright. If we onlycould go as far back as Point Hope, where there is so much of interest.I might have stayed over, but would surely have reproached myself formissing the remainder of the coast.Back off Wainwright, cold, windy, sky gloomy as usual.Late in the afternoon go with the trader to land, to visit the site ofan older village, about a mile down the shore. Walk along the beach.Cold wind, raincoat stiffens. Walrus meat and blubber chunks (slabs,etc.) along the beach at several places, also a large skinned seal.Traces, as one nears the village, of worked stones, but all waterwornand no finished objects. At one place in bank, about 3 feet deep, alayer of clear blue ice about 20 inches thick--strangely pure ice, notfrozen earth or even inclusion of any dirt or gravel.Village site small, along the edge of the low (about 10 feet) bluff.Count remains of eight dwellings. Some animal bones, but nothing elseon surface or in vicinity. Burial place not seen. Companion says thereis nothing.A simple supper at the trader's, prepared by his Eskimo wife, and goodcompany: Doctor Smith, of the Geological Survey, with two of his men;Jim Allen, the storekeeper, a big, good-hearted fellow; La Voy, thebig, active movie man, who knows all the gossip and enjoys tellingit with embellishment; and two men of the trader. Menu: Soup, boiledreindeer meat, underdone biscuits, coffee.After supper go to a meeting at the school, where our missionary,Doctor Goodman, is to talk to the natives. Large schoolroom crowded.I talk through an interpreter--a serious disadvantage--on cleanliness.Fine study for me on the many present, though like elsewhere on suchoccasions they are mainly women and children. Good many Indianlikefaces, though cheekbones more prominent and more flatness between them.But hair, low foreheads, eyes (except in children where they are moresuperficial, less sunken, and with more epicanthus than in Indians),lips, and other characteristics the same as in Indians. Some of thefaces are strong, many among the younger pleasant, some of the youngwomen handsome. A moderate number of mix bloods, even among the adults.Color of skin in full bloods medium to submedium brown, exactly as infull-blood Indians along the Yukon, but cheeks more dusky red.The behavior of these people is in all important points radicallythat of the Indian, but they are more approachable and open andmatter-of-fact people. More easily civilized. Good mechanics. Lesssuperstitious, more easily converted to white man's religion. And goodsingers. Their singing at the meeting in the schoolhouse would haveshamed a good many whites in this respect.Except for epidemics, I am told, these natives would more than holdtheir own in numbers. They are fecund, if conditions are right.Sterility is rare. They marry fairly young.August 3. Still standing, though we had to pull out farther south andaway from the shore. The water was pretty rough and I had to go to bedagain, but weather moderated.We are in touch with the world through the ship's radio, but get moretrash--same all through the radio service in Alaska--than serious news.Spend time in reading, talking; some play solitaire games; captain andAllen play cribbage. Deck too small for any outside games, even if itwere not so cold.Ice floes floating about us, now scarce, now thicker; water splashingagainst them and wearing them out into pillared halls, mushrooms, andother strange forms. Due to their snow covering, the water upon them,so far as it results from melting, is sweet, and in it swim many smallfishes. It snowed a bit again to-day.August 4. No change, except that the sea is somewhat calmer, and for awhile we have once more seen the sun, but it was hazy and just mildlywarm, while the same wind, from the sea, even though now subdued, hasan icy undertone. It snowed a little this morning.Thursday, August 5. Sea calm, atmosphere hazy, but the wind has turnedat last slightly offshore and the sun penetrates through the mists,until it conquers and shines, warm and bright if not wholly clear, oncemore. Ice visible only on the horizon. At 7.15 we start on anothereffort to reach Barrow.Pass Wainwright, and all is well until after lunch, when fog (thoughfortunately not thick) develops and the floes increase until they areas thick as at the first attempt in this same region. Heavy bumps andstrains follow one another and the boat must often go very slow oreven stop altogether. Sometimes the heavy ship just staggers from theimpact, but the floes are generally broken by the shock and swirl awayout of our way, or scraping the ship pass to the rear. All aboard shownew interest and energy. The forced stops and inaction were dullingeven to the crew.File a wireless to be sent from Barrow. It will reach Washingtonto-morrow after we shall have started on the return journey.Two dogs on board fight fiercely. An officer, the owner of one, tryingto separate them is bitten by his own through a finger.A marine, in swinging the heavy lead with which they are constantlysounding the depth, gets the cord caught about his hand and suffers abad sprain with fracture.The captain's little black cat, Peter, helps to entertain us by hisantics. No wonder sailors in their often monotonous existence like allsorts of mascots.Friday, August 6. Of course our dates got mixed, and more than one hasto consult the calendar and count. The _Bear_ had to turn back oncemore last night; ice too heavy. Anchored, however, not far to south.This morning very cloudy, rainy, chilly, but wind from near to east,and so from about 6 a. m. we are once more laboriously on our way.Now and then a bump, heave, stagger, then again the screw resumes itscheerful song. We are passing through the most dangerous part of allthe coast here where many vessels have been lost, sometimes whole smallfleets of whalers. But very few come here now--we have seen but onesince leaving Kotzebue. They call this stretch "the boat graveyard."Saturday, August 7. Stalled, about 30 miles from Barrow. Anchored inthe protection of a great grounded flat, in a clear pond of water,with ice all around it, but especially seaward, where the pack seemssolid. Some open water reported beyond it, but wind (wild) keeps fromthe wrong quarter and the captain will make no further attempt untilconditions change. Of course it is cloudy again and has rained someduring the night and morning, but the temperature is somewhat higher,so that one does not need an overcoat and gloves, although the officerswear their sheep-lined short coats which are nice and warm.After noon asked the captain for the skin whaleboat to explore theshore. The latter is nearly a mile distant and shows about 60 feet highdirt bluffs. Got the boat and went with the boatswain. Berg, a young"hand," Weenie, and the movie man, La Voy. Rowed with La Voy. Had awholesome two and a half hours exploring. Found a little stream, withtraces of native deer camp (collected two seal skulls); a moderatenumber of flowers and grasses (collected some mushrooms); some fossilshells from the bluffs; and two Eskimo burials. One of these, awoman, nearly all washed away and lost; of the other, a man, securedthe skull, jaw, one shoulder blade and part of a diseased femur withcorresponding socket (mushroom arthritis), also the two humeri. A goodspecimen. Returned, rowing again, near 4. All there playing cribbageand solitaire.Am tempted to walk to Barrow; but there are some streams in the waywhich it might be impossible to ford. Moreover, no one knows thedistance.Sunday, August 8. Morning finds us once more thwarted, and standingat our place of refuge. No change in conditions, but there will be achange of moon to-night, so I at least have hopes. In my travels Ilearned too much about the moon not to believe in it. Toward eveningice begins to move out.Monday, August 9. At 12.30 a. m., unexpectedly, a new start. The windhas turned at last (new moon!) to northeast, but is mild. Soon in ice.Many bumps and much creaking and shaking. Captain's collie gets scaredand tries to get into our beds, one after another. But very littlesleep under these conditions.In the morning we find ourselves in a thicker ice field than anybefore, with floes on all sides. Boat barely creeps. Toward 10 a.m. further progress found almost impossible, and so forced to turnbackward once more. However, can not even go back and so, near 12,anchor about a mile offshore opposite a small river with lagoon-likemouth and two tents of natives--"Shinara," or "Shinerara."Ask captain for a boat to visit and explore the coast. Consents, andso at 1 we go forth, about eight of us, with the captain's dog. ReachEskimo, photograph the group. All look remarkably Indianlike. Then goto look for skeletal material. Nothing near, so return for the Eskimoboy. He leads me about a mile over the highland tundra to two burialsin boxes--not old. Look through crevices shows in one an adolescent, inthe other a female (or a boy) with hair and skin still on. Leave both.Then into the boat once more after buying some fossil teeth, and withthe boy Isaac--his father is Abraham--try to go into the river, andsoon get stuck in the stickiest mud (oily shale) imaginable--great workto clean even the oar with which we had to push ourselves off. Landthen on the beach and for the next two hours explore that side of thebasin. Find remains of two small settlements--seven huts in all, nonevery old.Gather five skulls with parts of four skeletons, most bones missing;also some mushrooms, several interesting humeri of seals, and a pieceof pumice-like fossil bone. Near 4.30 begins to rain a bit so we hurryto boat, and in a little while, after depositing Isaac near his camp,reach the _Bear_.Eskimo on shore had two skinned seal lying on the ground, and therewere many reindeer horns. A pile of them was over a fire, being smoked.The wind has been the whole day from the northeast, the long-wished-forwind, and the ice has moved out sufficiently to induce the captain tomake another start. So at 5 p. m. off we go again, and for quite awhile the screw sings merrily, until we reach some remaining ice, whenthere are more bumps and staggers.The waters about the ship show, whenever calmer, the heads of swimmingseal, grown and little. But they are wary and keep at a distance.Otherwise the only live things are an occasional gull, and rarely acouple of ducks. In the icy water, however, on and about the floes, areseen again numerous small, dark fish (from the size of a big minnowto that of a tomcod); and along the shore swim merrily hundreds ofvery tame and graceful little snipes, lovely small birds, too little,luckily, to be hunted.Little enthusiasm about my collecting, but the boatswain and some atleast of the men are genuinely helpful. I believe some of the othersare a bit superstitious. But I get some chance at least, and that isprecious.Expect to reach Barrow before 12 p. m., and to start back beforemorning--a big chance for some sleep again if I want to do somecollecting. Sleep, through the frequent lack of it, has become a kindof obsession in one's thoughts, yet when there were chances during thedays of waiting it would not come.August 9, evening, to 10 next morning. This is a land of odds andwonders. In the morning things looked hopeless; toward evening the windhas driven away enough ice to make a narrow open lane near the shore,and utilizing this we arrived without difficulty at 8 p. m. at the longunreachable Barrow. At 9 boat takes us ashore. At 9.30 p. m. I startwith an Eskimo and a seaman (Weenie) from the _Bear_ on a collectingtrip over about 3 square miles of tundra behind Barrow, and at 12.30return to ship with four bags of skulls and bones. But sleep! Hardlyany since 12.30 last night, and very little after return to-day, fordue to fear of ice they called in everybody from shore before 3 a. m.,and the newcomers keep on walking and talking and banging with theirbaggage until 5, when, fearing a return of the ice, we start once moresouthward, toward--it feels strange, but it is so--home. It was aremarkable good fortune, our getting there thus and getting out again,as we did, without damage.Barrow is a good-looking and rather important place. It stretches about2 miles along the low shore, in three clusters, the two main onesseparated by a lagoon. It has a radio station, a mission hospital, anda school. There are over 200 natives here, and also quite a few whites,including Mr. Charles Brower, the trader, observer and collector, withhis native wife and their family, the teacher, the missionary and hisfamily, and the nurses.The burial place here is the most extensive in the Eskimo territory.Taking the older parts and the new, it covers over a square mile of thetundra, beginning not far beyond the site of the hospital and extendingto and beyond a small stream that flows over a mile inland. But theburials were grouped in a few spots, the rest being barren.This extensive burial ground is now about exhausted for scientificpurposes, except for such skeletons and objects as may have beenassimilated--i. e. buried--by the tundra. That such exist became quiteevident during our search, and they naturally are the oldest andmost valuable. We secured two good skulls of this nature. They werecompletely buried, only a little of the vault showing, and had therebeen time we should doubtless have found also parts of the skeletons.The skulls were discolored brown.Of the later skeletal material we found but the leavings, the besthaving been carried off by other collectors. There were remnants ofhundreds of skulls and skeletons, but for the most part so damaged asnot to be worth saving. Nevertheless our diligent midnight search wasnot in vain, and we brought back four sacks full of specimens, theEskimo carrying his with the utmost good nature. The destruction hereis due to sailors and other whites and to dogs, foxes, and reindeer.The reindeer herds, going in hundreds over the ground, help materiallyto scatter and damage the bones. So, the older material gone, whilethe more recent burials are, at least so far as the younger elementis concerned, quite worthless to science, containing many mix bloodsof all sorts--even occasionally with the negro (men from the wreckedwhaleboats). The collection now secured was the last one possible fromthis locality, except through excavation.Tuesday, August 10. The boat is now crowded. We lost one woman and gotthree; also about five or six men--newspaper, movie, radioman, a dogteamster, a trapper. Quite a variety, in every way, and most are to gowith us at least as far as Nome. They will have to hang up two hammocksin our little cabin each night, and some must sleep elsewhere.Packing the whole morning. Five boxes. My man of last night helping, afine, big young fellow. This aid in the work is a great boon to me,and the transportation of the many specimens by the _Bear_ down toSeattle or San Francisco will be a fine service to the Institution.The older of us, that is those who have been longer on the ship,feel like veterans and are drawn closer together. The new lot,heterogeneous, do not attract, particularly one of the women. An olderone, evidently a well-liked nurse, goes off at Wainwright, which wereach once more at 8 p. m. Here goes off also Jim Allen, the trader,who is a good fellow in a rough shell and whom I learned to like. Hehelped us all a good deal while in the ice.The movie man from Point Hope is a somewhat spoiled, gossipy, androughshod, but otherwise, a good-hearted big kid--not very wise, butnot mischievous, and more than efficient in his own calling. Is 40,but already aging, like a weather-beaten poplar--not pine or oak. Isviolently against all "kikes," or eastern money-lending Jews, from whomhe used to borrow at usurious interest and who sold him out once ortwice when he could not pay.Lost Jim Allen and dropped the nurse, but are still too many. At 10 p.m., just as the minister and I have retired, there comes a call for theformer to go up. A couple of Eskimos have arrived, with their friends,to be married. So he dresses and performs the function. I am too wearyto rise and dress to go and look at it. He says it was quite tame. Thenthe anchor, and once more we are off. No ice any more, and the sea hasagain a swell, which was absent in the ice-covered waters.Wednesday, August 11. Swell, but not bad, though one of the women,another nurse, is ill, and the other, a "writer," etc., will not get upfor breakfast. Quite a problem now to get washed and shaved. Both theminister (archdeacon) and the movie man like to use perfumed things,and the former takes much time with his toilet, so I endeavor as beforeto be first up.August 12. A great day. Was called a little after 12.30 a. m., afterbut little sleep (through anticipation), to examine a site ashore--acoal mine, a water source, and possibly something human. Two miles toshore, in semidarkness; no night yet in these regions. A long trampover the mossy and grassy tundra; mosquitoes. One native igloo, andon a little elevation some distance off a grave of a child; otherwisenothing. After examination of the coal strata, a curious secondaryinclusion in sand and gravel, and the stream of water (good to drink,even if not clear), we depart and reach ship again after 4 a. m.Beginning to be--in fact am already--a "night doctor," for sure.Never thought I could stand such doings, but am standing it, and thateven with some cold and bothersome night cough. But am sure short onsleeping, for it is impossible for me to catch up during the days; amnot a day sleeper. I suppose when one is most of the time half hungryhis mind naturally reverts to hunger, as mine does to sleep.We are due to-day again at Point Hope, and I am anxious for a littletime there.At night. This was a day of harvest. Reached Point Hope about 3 p. m.,but had to go around again to the other side, due to the swell and surfon the north. I went to shore in the first boat, about 4 p. m. DoctorGoodman, with whom we are very friendly, was with me and promised togo over and help me get some men with whom I want to excavate theburial hole of his predecessor. But when on the shore stays behindand remains. So we go on with my man from the ship to the whalebonegraveyard. Near there see two Eskimo men with some dogs. They smile;so I tell them what I want; in two minutes have engaged them; in aboutthree more we begin to dig, and in about five minutes after strikefirst bones.My good friend the boatswain, Mr. Berg, comes to help, and as I nowhave four to work I take a bag and go on collecting a little moreover the plains beyond where we are. Get a good bag. Find anothergood-natured Eskimo, Frank, coming from fishing, engage him to helpcarrying and eventually to take place of one of my first workers, whois an old man. Then we see Doctor Goodman, far away, coming to themission. Borrow two more shovels from his stock and a few coal bags.Meanwhile bone and skull pile is fairly exposed from one side and topgravel partly removed, so I give up intended trip to old village siteand, as we were given only to 9.30 p. m., go to work on the pile.A great deal here. More than anticipated, though all is a jumble, withthe long and other bones of the skeleton on the top. The work is to getdown in the moist gravel, disengage one bone and skull after anotheras rapidly as possible, give it a rapid look-over, and either save, iffairly well preserved or showing some special feature, or discard. Ifsaved, the specimen is handed to one of the Eskimo, who cleans it ofgravel, lays it out to dry a little, and then places it gently in a bag.Many of the bones and skulls were found so damaged that they had to beleft. But much was also good. The strenuous work, however, had to goon without interruption and at the fullest possible speed, if the mainpart of what was there was to be saved. So no supper, no stop for evena minute, until after 8 p. m. Sixteen bags full, and some of the sacksquite spacious. At last had to give up--no more time, no sacks, andlower down everything frozen as hard as flint. The main part, however,secured--183 good skulls, several hundred lower jaws, and a lot oflong and other bones. This, together with the rest of the material fromthis place, ought to give us data of much value.But now, how shall the lot be got on the boat. Luckily, one of theEskimo that has been working for me has a dog team and sled. So Iengage these; and shortly after we finish putting everything inorder--in the presence now of Doctor Goodman, who comes to look atus--the man arrives, with a good-sized sled and 13 whitish dogs. Loadall the bags on--and then a sight never to be forgotten--the dogspulling the load across the tundra, depressions, gravels, right down tothe water's edge and to the motor boat that is waiting for us. How theystrained, pulled with all will, and obeyed. A wise leader in front,six pairs behind. No reins, only a few calls from the Eskimo, and theyknew just what to do. Tried to photograph them, but light alreadypoor--advancing season. (Pl. 9, _a._ _b._)Then hurry to the teacher, not home; to La Voy, not home. Find teacherin tent, sick, trembling; I fear beginning of typhoid. Did not getanything for me in our absence. La Voy promised to give me some thingsfrom his collections, but now is not here. A native woman, however,meets me far out on the beach, and I learn she has dug out for me sinceour first visit five good skulls from the ground--some, she shows, deepto above the elbow. She has them near the ship--we go on--on the roadboys and women overtake me with a few things to sell. Then the womanbrings her skulls, in a bag on her back, in excellent condition. I payher for her trouble. Reach our boat, and the bell on the _Bear_ rings9.30.The bone pile--the sled and dogs and load over the tundra--the womancarrying a native (seal) bag with skulls--will be three rare, indeliblepictures.On the _Bear_ at 10. A little sandwich, fruit, and a cinnamon cake withcoffee, and to bed. But irritating tire-cough keeps me up for anotherhour.Friday, 13th. Packing. A nice day. Toward evening stop at Kevalina.Obtain a few things and pictures. To bed soon, but cough still bothers.I have nothing for it; there is but little on the boat in the way ofmedicines outside of the most ordinary things.Saturday, 14th. Up 5.30, early breakfast, and 6.45 start once morefor Kotzebue. The _Bear_ has anchored about 12 miles off, so do notreach village until 8.35, and have to go back at 9.10. Rush to store,get boxes, barrels, and packing. And then to the schoolhouse, whereI expect some information about the skeleton found under the houseand obtained on my former visit. Also promised information from Mr.Chance, the supervisor, about old sites. But Mr. Chance is gone, and noletter or message--it came later, to Washington. A few words with theteacher, and one of the boys from our boat is already calling me.Return at 11 a. m. and spend the rest of the day packing, finishingjust at supper. A curious sunset at 8, a horizontally banded sun,several clear-cut, fairly broad, dark bands. Sea getting rougher.Sunday, August 15. Bad sea, wind, waves, fog. Have to take to bed anddo without breakfast. Stay in until lunch. We could not stop again atShishmareff; could not get ashore. The next stop, late afternoon, isto be at the Little Diomede, to take off Jenness; but if too rough weshall go on to Teller. The wind is from the northwest and the foghornkeeps on blowing.The whole day continues rough, foggy, unfriendly. The ship can not stopat the Diomede, nor go to Teller; obliged to go to Nome. After supperall chairs and movable articles have to be tied up. Most day in bed,but escaped real seasickness, and got some sleep.Monday, 16. Weather moderated. We are in lee of the mountainous part ofSeward Peninsula. After breakfast off Nome, and at 11 a. m. in town.First stop at Lomen's. Then from one to another till 4.55 p. m., whenDan Sutherland, the Alaska Delegate to Congress, escorts me to theboat. Saw many friends, got some mail, and, best of all, got a finedeposit collection for the National Museum from Mr. Carl Lomen. Thejudge asked me for another lecture for next Saturday, when we are tosee Nome for the last time.About 5 a. m. arrive at Golovnin Bay to take water. At this place thisis generally a day of partial rest and recreation for the crew. Thewater is taken from a small stream fed by a spring that comes out froma cave of the mountain, and is put direct into the whaleboats, broughtto ship, and pumped into its tanks.Shortly after breakfast the captain gives us the larger motor boat,and with Mr. Berg and two of the seamen I start for a little surveytrip along the northern shore of the bay. In less than an hour we reacha sheltered nook with a small stream, where there is an old framedwelling with some out-structures, all evidently abandoned, thoughvarious articles of use hang or lie about, including several guns ofold patterns.On a bluff to the left of the house are six burials, some old, woodnear all rotten, some more recent. The latter, two in number, both showa large animal skin covering of the body, besides which the lattershows remnants of clothing. Secure two good skeletons, practicallycomplete; also head and a few parts of a newborn (or near) child. Aunique feature--with one of the male skeletons is found a completeskeleton of an eagle. Could have got also a female skeleton, but wasstill unclean, and we perceived a small native motor boat comingtoward us from the reindeer camp about 1½ miles farther inward. Sowe replaced everything (outwardly) and started off to meet the nativeboat. Found in it two young men and three women. Inquired about oldsites and learned of one about 3 miles farther inward.Stopped at the reindeer camp. Found there about a dozen individuals.Got more information, also a young man to go with us, bought for the_Bear_ a dozen good-sized silver salmon--caught this morning and lyingfor protection against flies, in a pool of water--and left for the oldsite "around the point."A nice site, but small. Fine beach for bathing if it were in a warmerclimate. Remains of about a half dozen semisubterranean houses. Acopper nail from one shows they were not very ancient. And no burialsleft, save one, more recent, of a child, most of which is gone. Butthere is a green elevated plane rising from the beach and we soon findseveral varieties of berries, especially large and good blueberries, avariety of huckleberry, and a sort of wine-tasting dwarf blackberry.Collect enough for immediate consumption--a most welcome diversion inevery way--and get some for the captain.Leave near 1 p. m. A little lunch on boat, then once more the reindeercamp, where the young women make us good hot coffee with as goodbiscuits as one could find anywhere. Buy more berries from them, loadour fish (12 salmon ranging about 12 pounds each, for $3), and startoff for another site just around Stony Point.Round up one point, then another and another, up to five, and by thattime the going has become so rough that we get much tossed about, shipwater, dog gets frightened and near sick, and just as we reach what wethought must be the last point there juts out still another. It is nowso rough that the boatswain thinks we could not land, and so nothingremains but to turn back to the mother boat. Reach there near 3.30 p.m. Soon all boats are hoisted, and at 4 the _Bear_ is on her way to St.Michael.August 18. Arrived about midnight off St. Michael; must stay outsidedue to shoal water. Somewhat rough.In the morning boat coaling, dirty work, so all who can go ashore. MeetMr. Williams again; buy a few native articles in stores, visit Mrs.Evans, the teacher-nurse, who has on an occasion successfully amputateda native's finger. The deputy marshal takes me to his house, gives mesome dried deer meat and smoked salmon strips, and promises to be on alookout for specimens for us. Near noon return. Still rough.At night a bad blow and the ship tossing a great deal, almost as duringthe storm to St. Lawrence. Feel it considerably, but after 3 a. m. windand water moderate. Feel effects of it, however, whole morning. For anexplorer to be ever in rough weather subject to seasickness is a horridaffliction.August 19. Off Nome once more. Everything, city, mountains, appearexceedingly, unnaturally clear--not a good sign. After 9 a. m. go totown. Soon at the Lomens' headquarters, and the sons, particularlyCarl, bring out three smaller boxes full of things from St. Lawrenceand Nunivak Islands, and give me the choice of all. And after I amthrough--near two hours' fast work--Carl adds one beautiful tusk(carved) from Nunivak Island, and then adds another, and two big bonesof a mammoth, some as gifts, some as an addition to his loan to ourinstitution. Excellent men.Lunch with Ralph and Carl; then a good walk in the open; and thenanother lecture. All pleased, and two bring me specimens for ourmuseum. Slowly back to boat and 4.45 on the _Bear_ again. Nice day, butgetting cooler and blustery.Captain Ross comes to port, the graphophone starts its usual jazz songsnext (ward) room, then the supper, all visitors gone, and the _Bear_raises anchor to be off for the north once more.August 19, evening. A new, final chapter begins with to-day. What willit contain when over?August 20. Rough. Go north until in plain sight of the Diomedes as wellas Cape Wales, and then the captain decides landing would be risky,if not impossible; and so reluctantly we turn back and proceed towardTeller. What a tantalizing experience this must have been to poorJenness, who is waiting for us on the Little Diomede, a most drearyplace, to be taken off; and I, too, expected collections at both theDiomedes and the Cape.Saturday, August 21. Port Clarence, off Teller. This proved a day neverto be forgotten; for failure of a rigid system, for bad weather, forstrain and endurance, and nearness to almost anything.My purpose was to utilize the _Bear's_ visit to Teller for a survey ofa Chukchee-Eskimo battle field, of which I heard repeatedly from theYukon onward. Sometime during the earlier half of the last century theChukchee from Asia are said to have made an invasion of the peninsulaand to have reached as far as the Salt Lake, east of Teller, when theywere met by the united Eskimo and badly defeated. The exact spot wherethis happened is, however, somewhat uncertain, and it was to locate it,examine, and collect what might be possible of the remains that weresaid to be still there that I asked Captain Cochran to let me have oneof the motor boats, to which he kindly consented, uniting the trip withsome topographical observations for his own purposes.The evening before I was told by the second officer that we shallstart some time soon after midnight for that part of the old battlefield--there seemed to be two of them--at the eastern point of the SaltLake. As a result could not undress, and after ship stopped in PortClarence, near 11 p. m., had but a little rest. The call came at 4 a.m. A little breakfast, a package of lunch, and start at 5.10.First note. Ship about 7 miles from Teller. Water deep enough muchnearer, but we came at night. Here there are already dark nightsbetween about 9 p. m. and 4 a. m., and so they were cautious.Second. The officer says he has orders not to stop at Teller, wherethere is an old Indian (Dunak) from whom I expected to get exactbearings, and where there is also a white trader, Mr. Peterson, whoknows the place and might possibly have accompanied us.Third. Distances, as usual, longer than estimated. We find eventuallythat the destination is about 32 miles from Teller.Fourth. A brisk head wind and sea retarding us.Fifth. As we approach our spot, a shoal water, with grass, preventingus from going straight to the most likely place, and no other waywas tried. It is 11 a. m. and already I hear an intimation that weshall not have time for anything except to make a lunch. This is thesame officer, a very good man at his post but rigid and without muchinterest in anything else than his own field, who after 10 miles' tripto Kotzebue gave us 25 minutes there, when it required 15 minutes aloneto reach the school from the boat.So we end by landing on the extremity of a spit there to make lunch,and I have only the time it takes to prepare the latter. I find, inhurry, remains of five old semisubterranean dwellings on the northernside of the point, and about as many low mounds with remnants about ofrotten driftwood--undoubtedly old burials. Probably the skeletons havebeen assimilated by the tundra vegetation and blown material. A singlenative skull, a female, without face, is lying about. Collected.While lunch is being made ready the officer and the boatswain, Mr.Berg, each shoot a duck. Then the lunch, a hurried loading, anddeparture, after some delay in setting the sail, at 1.30 p. m. I sawnothing that looked like a battle field. Its determination and surveymust be left for some future explorer.Sail rapidly. Wind fresh, with us, also waves. Cross Salt Lake, andTussoc "River." About 4.30 reach Grantly Harbor and wind increases;also waves. We run fast, and well enough, but the umiak (skin boat) weare pulling begins to suffer. It rides crazily and is jerked over theseething waves. The crossbar by which it is partly held breaks, and nowthe boat goes more sidewise, with water lapping over its border andgetting in. Wind now quite a gale, breaking waves everywhere--everynow and then a big one--whitecaps all over. A dim view of Teller indistance, when the skin boat begins to fill more rapidly and sag. Muststop engine--waves toss us like mad--one could be thrown bodily out ofthe boat if not careful in bending or moving and holding. The sailcomes down and the mast is laid down, a bad piece of work. Berg andPete Brant (an elderly trapper with us but formerly of Coast GuardService at Nome, a good sailor and knowing these waters) work veryhard and well. The skin boat has to be pulled alongside and bailed outby young Weenie, a very hard and dangerous task. Mr. Berg's rain hat("souwester") blows off and is lost in the seething waves. Later Weenienearly loses his--snatches it out between the boats with a narrowescape for his head. Then Weenie climbs into the skin boat--a braveact--and finishes the bailing, but is much "in" after getting back.Then our big staunch motor launch starts again at reduced speed. Butthe skin boat does great antics and threatens to fill again or break;so Pete Brant holds the rope and is jerked every now and then, until Ifear that he may any moment be jerked out into the waves and watch tocatch his legs. Fortunately he succeeds in preventing it, but there wasa slim margin.It has drizzled or rained, besides the wind, most of the afternoon,and there is a lot of spray to splashes from the waves. All this hasto be taken as it comes, but the water is not cold, and our bootsand oilskins give protection. Nevertheless my right knee to hip getsthoroughly wet and chilly, and I was not alone. But there is littletime to think of such things. We see at Teller the waves breaking highon the shore, some boats already on the beach and others being driventhere, a few people looking helplessly on.About 5.50 we round the Teller spit and come in the lee of it intocalmer water. But the visibility over the water is probably not overa mile now, and we see no trace of the _Bear_. The gasoline supplyis getting rather low; and all are more or less cold, though dressedwarmer than I and, due to their hip-high rubber boots--mine reach onlyto the knee--not wet. I now shake a lot with the cold, without beingable to stop it. So we skirt the protecting bluffs southward to whereeveryone thinks the _Bear_ is, near a little stream from which theywere to take fresh water. But though we all strain our eyes to thelimit, there is no trace of the ship.Thus reach Cape Riley and the stream, which is found dry, without adrop of water. Get on the pebbly beach, turn skin boat over to get thewater out, and hurry to chop wood. No wood save the water troughs, sochop these. Must have fire. I warm up a little by running around andchopping. They pour gasoline on the wood, make a big fire, cook a potof coffee, and with bread and preserved meat make a supper, though itis mainly coffee.Near 8 and getting dark. Storm, outside of protection of cliffs,unabated. There is a second watering place, 7 or 8 miles across thebay, and our only chance to find the _Bear_ is to rush for this. But todo this we must go diagonally across the waves and similarly againstthe wind--a bad prospect. Also, we have only just about enough gasolineto reach the place. But there is no help.Thus a new start, and before long we are once more in the waves. It isnow quite obscure. The waves break now and then and splash over us.Before long the skin boat is again sagging and in danger of sinking.Once more pull alongside and dangerous, exhausting bailing by Weenie.And so on, tossed, driven aside, but thanks to the good engine neverstopping. I hold to seat not to be thrown against things or even out;the others are becoming gruff, irritable. And then Higsby makes out afaint light far ahead. No one certain, but in a while it seems moving.A solitary small light somewhere far on the shore, probably, not theboat.But soon another stronger light discerned, seemingly moving to theleft, and later several--the ship in all probability.We toss and reel and stagger nearer, but motor still going strong.For the skin boat they found at last a position in which it takes butlittle water. Finally see decisively a blinking light, the mast signal.We show our lantern a few times. Then the ship looms before us, butthere is still the risky task of getting alongside and aboard. However,all is accomplished without real damage.The cabin--the good and anxious captain--a little canned grapefruit,and bed. But head falls and rises, the events of the day reappear,wonder what has become of the trade schooner we saw being driven on thebeach--and so on until consciousness passes into deep sleep. The _Bear_is fairly quiet, not in the brunt of the weather. And this eventuallymoderates, so that a little after 4 we start again, only to anchor oncemore at 6, a little below where last night we had our supper.August 22. Cloudy, drizzly, rough still, and wireless news ofwidespread bad storms, even in the States. So we shall wait. One morehope for my collections at the Cape and with Jenness.Captain says this morning the officer misunderstood his orders aboutTeller. The trip demonstrated a number of things. One of the main andmost gratifying was the sterling quality of the men with me, officer,boatswain, motorman. Weenie, Pete, in the teeth of real danger. Theywere all that men should be under such conditions, which is the bestway I can express it. The trip may have been in vain so far as itsscientific object was concerned, but it brought a number of men face toface with life's stresses and found their mettle of the truest quality,without exception, to witness which was worth the whole experience.August 22-23. During the night have left Port Clarence and endeavoredonce more to reach Wales and the Diomedes, to be again turned away byfog and rough weather. The captain doubts if there will be any moredecent "spells." The season for this stormy sea is too far advanced.Unable to land anywhere.The day is followed by another horrid night, again off the St. LawrenceIsland. Boat tossing and heaving and rolling, waves reaching and evensplashing over the level of the high upper deck in the back, everythingtied tip and cleared or fastened, a danger in making even a few stepsof being thrown against something, or on the deck of being thrownoverboard, and everything constantly cracking, creaking, with everyfew minutes an impact big thud-like or a splash of a wave, the floorheaving and twisting; and thus from before evening until morning.Then a trace easier, but the whole day gloomy and rough and the nightagain more unsettled. To-day better, wind which began east thenturned northwest, then almost north, now stopped, but a heavy swellis running, heaving us nearly as much as yesterday. We have gone veryslowly.Have arrived off Savonga. The sky is now clear and there is not muchwind, but the swell is and keeps on such that, notwithstanding therepeated calls of our siren, the Eskimo whom we see above the beachnear their boats, do not dare to launch these and come, nor does thecaptain care to risk one of our own launches, though we need freshreindeer meat and all would like once more to meet the nice lot ofnatives of this village. After a prolonged wait and as conditions showno improvement, nothing remains but to leave the island.Our next stop, if the weather permits, is to be at Nunivak Island.This is a large island off the Alaskan coast, well below the presentdelta of the Yukon and some distance above Kuskokwim Bay. The islandis one of the least explored, and the people living upon it one ofthe least known. It is only during the last few years that a tradingand a reindeer post has been established on this island, and onlythe second year that there is a teacher. What little is known of thenatives, a branch of the Eskimo, shows that they have many differenthabits from those farther north, in clothing, decoration, etc. Theymake rather good black pottery, and from this island come the mostelaborate carvings in ivory, reminding strongly of small totem poles.A photograph of a group of these people, seen at the Lomen Studio atNome, showed remarkably broad and short faces, unlike the Eskimo of thenorth. All of which made me very anxious to visit the island.To be brief such a visit, though promised to me by the captain, couldnot be realized. The waters about the island are so imperfectlycharted that in weather that continued half rough it was thoughtunwise to risk a landing. I felt this keenly, as the various otherimpossibilities of the trip. But I could never forget all theunexpected help I received from the Revenue Cutter Service, forwhich I was deeply grateful, and had to acknowledge the justice ofthe captain's position. We came so near that the land birds from theisland were already about us, but then turned toward the Pribilofs andUnalaska....Only little remains to be told. At the Pribilof Island, St. Paul, westopped at night, to take on four live fur seals for the Academy ofSciences of San Francisco, and there we ran once more into stormyweather. Here are a few notes from this period:August 27. Toward evening again a gale, southwest. At night worse. Shiptossing rather wildly. No possibility to me of either getting up orresting. Barely keep from being horribly ill again.Later in night ship had to be turned back and just drift.August 28. All day the storm continues. I could take no meals, not evena drop of water. In bed and barely standing it. Ship hove to at lastand just drifting.August 29. Gale keeps on just as bad, howling till 1.30 a. m. Then itmoderates somewhat and ship starts going again. Last night we were only60 miles from Unalaska, now a good deal farther out. Steam, still inhalf a gale and big sea, until after midday, when, not without somedifficulty and danger, we reach the fine little protected harbor ofUnalaska. Feel weak, near worn out.August 30, p. m. Rest, and all is well again. Secure a little rowboatand go with old Pete Brant to near-by islands. Storm over for theday and fair, though not entirely. Row, climb hills, pick berriesand mushrooms, watch a bearlike semiwild pig, out whole afternoon,returning strengthened, refreshed. Only no appetite yet. Found notraces of human occupancy, but heard of some in the "Captain's Bay" andat other spots.The few Aleuts in Unalaska at this time show physiognomies akin to thebrachycephalic Indian, and not the Eskimo type.August 31-September 1. A new gale, with drizzles. Luckily we are at adock, but I can do little. They are cleaning the boilers and coaling.Evening of 1st have a good dinner--captain and the rest of us from the_Bear's_ cabin--at a friendly local trader, Louis Strauss, and afterthat give lecture on "Man's Origin, etc." Introduction by Capt. VanBuskirk, local commodore of the Revenue Cutter Service. Lecture wellreceived, make numerous friends, get good information. Strauss's supperwas the first I could eat with some taste and hunger. But the lecturedid me good.September 2. Coaling and overhauling of boilers finished. Gale stopped.Ship leaves 1 p. m. Day fairly sunny. Everyone sees us off. Harbor andhills look fine, though sky again clouded. Outside quite a swell afterthe gales. Pass the _Haida_, practicing with her cannon. The _Algonkin_was here too, with the story of their visit to the Punuk Islands. Thefresh green steep mountains toward the entrance of the harbor arerefreshing to the eye.Pass through Akitan. Pass picturesque, especially the outstandingisolated rocks near the islands.Toward evening, far to the left (east), see under the clouds a gloriousicy cone, the "Pogrovemoi," and later a lower but still great mountaina little farther and to the right an old but not so very old volcano.Other volcanoes there are, the captain tells me, now hidden by the lowclouds.Have a new passenger, Mr. Charles Brower, the trader of Barrow. Camefrom the _Brower_, ship of his own company, a little larger and fasterthan the _Bear_, and going also to San Francisco, but with pooreraccommodations. Brings with him a box of archeological specimens fromthe Barter Island, in the north. Examine them, but find little ofspecial interest.It takes us a little less than 10 days of a fairly good journey toreach San Francisco. Dock at Oakland late in the evening. The nextmorning, after breakfast, the boxes and barrels with collections aretaken on the dock--a big pile. Then the Santa Fe officials kindlyrun a flat freight car to the pile, the boxes, etc., are loaded on,the main part taken to the freight depot, the most valuable ones toexpress, shipped, and shortly after what remains of the expedition ison the Santa Fe Limited for Chicago. It only needs to be added that,notwithstanding the variety of receptacles and the difficulties ofpacking, the collections reached the Institution without damage toa single specimen. Thanks once more for the help received in makingall safe to the captain and officers of the _Bear_, to Mr. Berg, thebest of boatswains, to the carpenter, and to all those of the crew whoassisted.THE YUKON TERRITORY--SITES, THE INDIANS, THE ESKIMOTHE TANANABRIEF HISTORICAL DATAThe Tanana is the largest tributary of the Yukon. It is over 600 milesin length, and in its breadth, though not in its volume, it appearsto equal, if not to exceed, the Yukon at their junction. The firstwhite men to see the mouth of the Tanana were the Russian traders(about 1860), followed before long by the employees of the Hudson BayCo. Dall says that it has long been noted on the old maps of RussianAmerica, under the name of the River of the Mountain Men, while theHudson Bay men called it the Gens-des-Buttes River. (Alaska and ItsResources, 281-282.) Dall mapped the junction of the river with theYukon. The first who descended a part of its course were two traders,Harper and Bates, who reached the river higher up, sometime in the lateseventies. The name of Harper is preserved by having been given tothe big bend of the stream, 12 miles above its mouth. Its scientificexploration begins only in 1885, with the passage down nearly itsentire length of Lieut. Henry T. Allen, United States Army;[5] the mainwork concerning the geography and geology of the river being done in1898 by A. H. Brooks.[6]FOOTNOTES:[5] Allen, Henry T., Military Reconnaissance in Alaska.

VII,437-438; also the Geog. and Geol. Alas., U. S. Geol. Surv. Doc. 201,1906.POPULATIONThe native population of the Tanana has always been remarkablyscarce. Dall obtained an estimate of their whole number as about 150families.[7] Petrof, in 1880, thought they numbered perhaps sevenor eight hundred;[8] Allen in 1885 estimated them at between 550and 600;[9] Brooks, in 1898, thought there were less than 400;[10]and the 1910 United States Census gives the total number of the"Tenan-kutchin," full bloods and mix bloods, as 415.[11]According to Brooks (Reconnaissance, 490-491), the Tanana natives wereseparated into two geographic contingents, the eastern or highland andthe northwestern or lowland groups. The most easterly group includedthe Indian settlements in the vicinity of Forty-mile and Mentasta Passtrail; the northwestern comprises to-day those from Nenana to the mouthof the river.The Tanana Indians were generally regarded by other natives aswarlike and dangerous, but so far as their relation with the whiteswas concerned there was little justification for this notion.[12]Physically they were reported by Brooks to "average rather better thanthe Indians of the Yukon" (Reconnaissance, 492). There are but a fewand scanty other references to them in this connection.FOOTNOTES:[7] "Their numbers are supposed not to exceed 150 families." Alaska andIts Resources, p. 108.[8] Notes Alas.

Alaska, 686-709.INDIAN SITES AND VILLAGES ALONG THE TANANA_Upper course._--On this much larger part of the river it is possibleto report but indirectly.A. H. Brooks, in 1898, reports thus on this subject:[13] "SeveralIndian houses are found on and near the Tanana between the Good-pasterand Salchakat and constitute a subgroup of the upper TananaIndians. * * * The most thickly settled part of the region is along thesluggish portions of the lower Tanana. The largest villages are at themouth of the Cantwell and Toclat Rivers, and each of these consistsof a number of good cabins. In the intervening region there are anumber of isolated houses and fishing stations, which are marked on theaccompanying map."[Illustration: FIGURE 1.--The Tanana River between Nenana and Tanana,with Indian villages]To which Lieutenant Castner, who explored the upper Tanana, adds thefollowing:[14] "On 750 miles of the Tanana proper and its tributaries Isaw seven small hamlets, and not to exceed 100 Indians--men, women, andchildren."From information obtained by me at Fairbanks, at the United Statesmarshal's office and from miners, it appears that the followingvillages are better known:  Village, 150 miles east of Fairbanks.  Mansfield Lake village, 300 miles east of Fairbanks.  Tetlen, 410 miles east of Fairbanks.  East Tetlen, 7 miles southeast of Tetlen.FOOTNOTES:[13] Brooks, A.

Nenana (or Tortella), about a mission, half a mile from the railroadstation and town of the same name, on the left bank of the Tanana andnear the mouth of the Nenana River. (Fig. 1.)2. "Old Minto," 27 miles from Nenana, right bank; but a small number ofIndians there now.3. Village at the mouth of the Tolovana, right bank (where the Tolovanaenters the Tanana); the village is on the distal (downstream) point.Nearly abandoned; only two families there now. Summer (fishing) camp onthe opposite point.4. A small settlement at mouth of Baker Creek, right bank, about 4miles upstream from Hot Springs.5. "Crossjacket village," on left bank, about 45 miles above Tanana, 40miles below Hot Springs. Used to be called "Cosna." Occupied, thoughonly a few there.6. Near 5, but on the opposite bank, a few habitations.During the open season the Indians live scattered along the river infishing camps. This is especially true along the right bank downstreamfrom Nenana.THE YUKON BELOW TANANABRIEF HISTORYThe Yukon is the principal river of Alaska. It is one of the greatestand most scenic rivers in the world. It is approximately 2,300 mileslong (from the headwaters of the Lewes River), in its middle and lowercourses ranges at times with its sloughs to several miles in breadth,and includes many hundreds of islands of its own formation. Its sceneryis still essentially primeval, affected but little by human occupationor industry. It has, in fact, gone considerably back in these respectssince the gold rush was over.This great stream has been known to the white man for less than acentury. Cook, in September of 1778, sailed near, discovering StuartIsland and Cape Stephens of the St. Michael Island, but missed theriver.In 1829 P. E. Chistiakof, director (1826-1830) of the Russian-Americancolonies, sent the naval officer Vasilief to explore the coasts betweenthe Alexander Redoubt (at the mouth of the Nushagak) and the Shaktolor Norton Sound, and in 1830 Vasilief explored the larger part of theKuskokwim River, of which the Russians knew already from their earlierexplorers. Here they heard of an even greater stream to the north.In 1831, on the recommendation of Vasilief, Michail DmitrievichTebenkof was sent to Norton Sound with the view of further explorationand the establishing of a post in that region. Tebenkof discoveredthat Cape Stephens was not a part of the mainland but of an island;and he built here a fortified post which in honor of his patron saintis called St. Michael, a name which subsequently passed to the wholeisland. The post was to serve both trade and further exploration.From St. Michael, at the end of 1834, a small party is sent out underthe leadership of an educated "kreol" (son of a native mother andRussian father), Andrei Glazunof, and on January 26, 1835, they reachthe good-sized Indian village of Anvik, on the Kwikhpak, or Yukon.[15]From here Glazunof travels down the river to the large village ofAninulykhtykh-pak (above Holy Cross), the last Indian (as distinguishedfrom Eskimo) village down the river, whence Glazunof sends most of hisparty back to St. Michael and himself proceeds to the Kuskokwim.In 1836 the Russians effect the first settlement on the Yukon, atIkogmiut (Zagoskin, 6), later known as the Russian Mission.In 1838 Malakof, over land portage, reaches Nulato and builds therea trading post, which, during his absence the next winter, is burnedby the natives. In 1841 Dieriabin rebuilds and fortifies this post,becomes its headman, and is there eventually (1851) killed by theIndians.In 1841 Lieut. Laurenti Alexief Zagoskin is delegated to explore the"Kwikhpak," with its portages to the Kotzebue Sound, and the KuskokwimRiver; and in 1843 he navigates and maps 600 miles of the Yukon, orfrom about the mouth of the Apkhun (northern) pass to the mouth of theNovitna River, with approximately 100 miles of each, from their mouth,of the Koyukuk and of the Ittege (or Innoko) Rivers.The Russian post at Nulato remains until the sale of their Americandominions by the Russians to the United States in 1867. From it andfrom St. Michael individual Russian traders ranged over the river andits lower affluents, but there was no further noteworthy scientificexploration. In 1863, however, Lukin, who after Vasilief and Kolmakofhelped to explore the Kuskokwim, reached to Fort Yukon.Meanwhile the river has been visited by both the English and theAmericans. In 1847 Mr. Bell, of the Hudson Bay Co., having heard of thegreat stream from some of the Indians who visited the fort on PeelsRiver, set out in quest of it, accompanied by a native guide, andreached it by the Rat and the Porcupine Rivers.[16]Between 1843 and 1867 the river in its lower and middle reaches isfreely traversed by the Russian traders. In 1851 Nulato is reached byLieutenant Barnard, of H. M. S. _Enterprise_, in search of Franklin,only to be massacred there with some of the Russians and natives by theoffended Indians of the Koyukuk. In 1861 Robert Kennicott traversesa part of the Yukon, and in 1865 he, with Capt. Charles S. Bulkley,leads there the expedition of the Western Union Telegraph Co., which isaccompanied by William H. Dall and Frederick Whymper, and results inmuch information. Already, however, in 1863, Strahan Jones, commanderof the Peels River Fort, has descended the Yukon to the mouth ofthe Novitna River or the uppermost point reached by Zagoskin, thuscompleting its identification as one and the same great stream. Thispoint and the Tanana mark the westernmost penetration by the English(the Hudson Bay Co.).In 1865 begin American explorations proper. In that year, under anagreement with the Russians, Maj. Robert Kennicott, heading a partyof the Western Union Telegraph explorers, crosses from St. Michael toNulato. Kennicott dies in Nulato a year later, but the explorations arecarried on to result eventually in a series of valuable publications,more particularly by Dall and Whymper.[17]The researches under the auspices of the Western Union Telegraph Co.,themselves backed by the Government, are followed by explorations underthe direct auspices of the American Government. Thus, in 1869 there isa reconnaissance of the river by Capt. C. W. Raymond; in 1883, that byLieut. Frederick Schwatka; in 1885 by Lieut. Henry T. Allen; in 1898by Capt. W. P. Richardson; and these are succeeded by the geologicalsurveys of A. H. Brooks and companions.[18]From 1878 on commenced placer and mining explorations for gold inAlaska leading gradually to the eventual great gold rush of the laternineties, which brought a whole flotilla of large river steamers andother craft to the Yukon and led to a rapid growth of some of the oldand the establishment of a number of new settlements along its banks.The rash passed in turn, many of the miners and others departed, boatsbecame idle and were beached or taken to the St. Michael ship "boneyard," where, together with most of the buildings, they are now (1926)being broken up; and the Yukon has reverted in a large measure to itsformer primeval, dormant, lonely state.Such, in brief, is the white man's history of the Yukon, with all ofwhich the river remains but half known, at best. It has never beenfully surveyed, which would be a vast and unending task. It containsa large number of barely known little tributaries that are lost inthe jungle-covered flats with their many pools and lakes. It hasinnumerable islands and channels, in which the traveler is easily lost,and it cuts and builds constantly during the open season. Its valley issqually and rainy. The stream may one moment be like a great, liquid,softly flowing mirror, to be in a few minutes churned into an ugly anddangerous roughness from which every smaller boat must seek shelter.Its shores are inhospitable, except for the native fisherman andhunter, and torment man with swarms of gnats and mosquitoes.But there is no malaria; no snakes or other poisonous things. Andwhen the weather is decent the water, the wooded shores, and thefresh, clean virginal parklike islands have a greatness and charm thatcompensate for much. Besides which there is the still more intensiveallure of original exploration. Botany, zoology, and above allpaleontology, find here still a fruitful field, while for anthropology,and especially archeology, the land is still largely a terra incognita.FOOTNOTES:[15] There is some confusion about the exact date of Glazunof'sjourney, partly due perhaps to the fact that he started on Dec. 30.Wrangell (Stat. and Ethnog. Nachricht., 138) says that Glazunof'sexpedition was outfitted the same year (1833) in which the St. Michaelredoubt was established. In Zeleny's abstract of Zagoskin's report(p. 212) and by Zagoskin himself (pp. 6, 23) the departure of theexpedition is put a year later, or 1834, which is probably correct.Dall's remarks (Alaska and Its Resources, 276, 338) on the subjectcontain several errors, both of dates and facts. There is alsoconsiderable confusion as to the names Kvikhpak and Yukon. The termKvikhpak (Kvikh, river; pak, large) is of Eskimo origin and was appliedby these to that part of the river which they occupied. The name Yukon,or something near this, is of Indian derivation and was applied tothose parts of the river, below Tanana at least, that were peopled bythe Khotana or Indians.[16] Richardson, J., Arctic Searching Expedition, London, 1851, II, 206.[17] For details see Dall's Alaska and Its Resources, Boston, 1870.[18] See Compilation of Explorations in Alaska, Senate Rept. 1023,Washington, 1900; and reports on Alaska of the United States GeologicalSurvey.THE YUKON NATIVESUpon their arrival on the Kvikpak and Yukon, the Russians found thebanks of the stream peopled in its upper and middle courses by Indiansand lower down by the Eskimo.[19] The last Indian village downstreamwas Aninulykhtykh-pak, since completely gone. Its site is identifiablewith one that used to exist in front of the present mission of HolyCross or just above. The first Eskimo village of some note was Paimute.As to the Indians of the Yukon and its tributaries, there is aconsiderable confusion of names, almost every author using his ownspelling and subdivisions. It is evident that there were two sets ofnames of the various Indian contingents, namely the names, sometimescontemptuous, given to them by outsiders, and the names in useamong themselves, which generally meant the people of this or thatlocality. The facts are that they all belonged to the Tinné or Denéfamily;[20],[21] that there were two probably related generic names forthem, namely Kutchin (used especially on the upper Yukon) and Khotana(used mainly along the central and lower parts of the stream); andthat along the Yukon itself, with its channels, there were three mainsubdivisions of the people: The Kutchin (with various qualifications)on the upper parts of the river, down to Fort Yukon; the Yukonikhotana,from Fort Yukon to Nulato;[22] and the Kain (Petrof) or Kaiyuh (Dall)Khotana, or Inkaliks (of the Russians), from Nulato to Holy Cross.In addition there were the Tenan-kutchin Tenan-khotana or Mountain-menof the Tanana; and the Yunnaka-khotana (Zagoskin) or Koyukuk-khotana(Dall), the people of the Koyukuk.These groups were settled in a moderate number of permanent or wintervillages along the rivers, in the summer spreading along the streams incamps. The population found by the first Russian explorer, Glazunof,from Anvik to Aninulykhtykh-pak, was seemingly a rather large one. Heis reported by Wrangell to have counted, at Anvik, 240 grown males; atMagimiut, 35; and at Aninulykhtykh-pak 300. At the last-named villagein particular there were present "many people," Glazunof estimatingaltogether nearly 700. These figures, except for Magimiut, seem toolarge and were not even approached later; but before the next count,that by Zagoskin, all these settlements had been visited by smallpox;and at the big village Glazunoff may have seen a potlatch, such as maystill yearly be witnessed at some settlements on the river.Zagoskin in 1843 made a detailed and evidently reliable count of allthe villages that became known to him. His data in this respect, as inothers, being of fundamental value, are here given, the Eskimo, forconvenience, being included.FOOTNOTES:[19] See Auszug aus dem Tagebuche des Schiffer-gehülfen AndreasGlasunow.

(Contr. Am. Ethn., I, 23, 39), estimated thenumber of the Yukon Eskimo at 1,000 and that of the Yukon and KoyukukIndians, from the mouth of the Tanana downward, at 2,800. Only a fewsites of villages are incidentally given by Dall.Ivan Petrof, as a special agent for Alaska of the United States Censusfor 1880, reports himself the following Indian settlements and numbersof inhabitants on the Yukon (Compil.

Yet they are not without value,particularly in showing the earlier population of the villages and therelative proportion of the sexes and ages. The more helpful details aregiven in the appendix; for still others see references in bibliography.FOOTNOTES:[23] See also Petrof (Ivan), Tenth Census Rep., Wash., 1880, VIII, 37;but his transliteration of names is not always correct.[24] This doubtless included many subadults.[25] 31 per cent, or 1 in 3.2.PRESENT CONDITIONSTo-day, judging from all the obtained evidence, which comprisedinformation, the witnessing of a potlatch at Tanana at which wereassembled practically all the Indians above Nulato, and a visit belowthe Tanana of nearly all the villages where the Indians still live, thetotal number of the Tinneh on the lower Tanana (from Fairbanks to themouth of the river) and on the Yukon from Tanana to Anvik, can scarcelybe estimated to reach 1,000. It is probably well below that number.Moreover, not one-half of the adults and much fewer among the youngare still full bloods. Disease, bad liquor (Yukon), and mostly as yetimperfect accommodation to changing conditions are steadily diminishingthe numbers. Since our visit many have died from influenza, especiallyat Anvik. Their future is not hopeful. On the Tanana, however, and withthe more educated in general, conditions are better, and much good isbeing done by the four missions on the two rivers (Nenana, Tanana,Anvik, and Holy Cross).The old Indian settlements along the Yukon are gone, with a fewexceptions. On some of the sites, as at Tanana, Nulato, Kaltag, etc.,there are new villages bearing the old names but built by or inimitation of whites and sheltering a mixed population. The very namesof not a few of the older Indian sites have gone into oblivion; or thenatives call those they still know by a corruption of a white man'sname, such as "Ulstissen" (for Old Station). Anvik alone has kept itsoriginal site and some of its old character, the mission and the whitetrader being across the river.In the Eskimo part of the Yukon, below Holy Cross, conditions on thewhole appear to be somewhat better. There has also been a diminutionin population. The majority of the old villages have ceased to exist,while under the influence of whites some new settlements or nameshave appeared. Yet there are respectable remnants of the Eskimo, and,being better workers than the Indian and seemingly more coherent,they manage to sustain themselves somewhat better than he does. Theirgreatest handicap is disease. The beneficial effect among them of theold Russian Mission has declined, but there are a number of Governmentschools which have a good influence. They are more tractable, sensible,and in some respects perhaps more able than the Indians.But there exists to-day no clear-cut demarcation, geographical,cultural, or even physical, between the two people. Anvik, the lastIndian village downstream, is in every respect at least as much Eskimoas Indian; more or less Eskimo-like physiognomies are seen again andagain among the Indians; and Indianlike features are common among theEskimo. There has either been an old and considerable admixture on bothsides, or there are some fundamental similarities of the two groups;perhaps both.ARCHEOLOGY OF THE YUKONUp to 1926 no archeological work had been done along the Yukon orits tributaries, and barring a few isolated specimens there were noarcheological collections from these regions.The archeology of the river consists, (1) of the dead but formerlyknown villages; (2) of older sites, "dead" and unknown before eventhe Russians arrived; and (3) of random stone objects worked by manthat now and then are washed out from the river banks or are found inworking the ground. Except in details conditions are much alike alongthe whole river and will best be dealt with as a whole.THE RANDOM SPECIMENSWherever the beach of the river shows more or less of stones that arenot talus or just pebbles, there are generally found stones workedby man. Such localities are scarce. The first exists between Tanana(the village) and the mission above it. Here specimens are foundoccasionally on the beach and occasionally in the soil of the localgardens. Other such sites were located at Bonasila, below Anvik, andin four places between Paimute and the Russian Mission. A few are alsopresent from Marshall seaward.An examination of the terrain adjacent to such parts of the beach showsmostly, but not always, traces of an old settlement.The specimens consist of characteristic axes or adzes, stone scrapers,hammers, stone knives (along the Eskimo part of the river), tomahawkheads (probably), objects less well defined, and chips. There may besemifossilized animal bones, and rarely a bit of charcoal, a piece ofpottery (for details see Narrative), or an object of ivory.The ax proper is peculiar. It is a cupid's-bow ax, double-edged,and with one or two grooves across its middle. (Pl. 10.) It is as arule made of heavy basaltic stone, and its edges are sharpened bypolishing. Rough parts may have been polished also on the body. Itsdistal surface is convex (from sharp edge to sharp edge), its proximalsurface straight or mildly convex. I succeeded in getting a specimenremounted recently by one of the Indians near Tanana. This form of anax is still remembered by the old Indians when in use. They cut treeswith it, cutting sidewise and detaching the wood in splinters. Theyalso remember clubs with stone heads, and told me they were carriedon the back over the right shoulder so as to be ready for instant andeffective use.These axes have apparently been used by both the Indians and theEskimo, but there is an interesting difference. The several specimens Iobtained or saw from Tanana to Ruby were all complete. But from, aboutthe vicinity of Ruby downstream the bi-edged ax seems to disappear, or,rather, one-half of it disappears, the butt henceforth either beingleft unfinished or one-half of the double ax being broken off and theremainder being mounted now as an adze on a shorter handle. This form,and it exclusively, with various secondary modifications, is found overa wide area among the Eskimo and may reach into Asia, for I obtained aspecimen of it from one of the Diomede Islands. It connects directlywith the Bering Sea Eskimo ivory adze and chisel. On the other hand thebi-edged ax appears, in various modifications, to extend widely overIndian Alaska.The remaining stone implements need but little mention here. They willbe studied and reported separately by our archeologist. A specialnote will, however, be necessary later about the very primitive stoneindustry of Bonasila, below Anvik. (See p. 144.)Of pottery I have seen no example above Anvik, but this can not betaken as evidence of its absence above that point. At Anvik, Bonasila,and farther down the pottery is like that of the western Eskimo. Itis coarse ware, hand shaped, and of rather poor quality. It consistsof small round bowls to fairly large, more or less conical, jars. Itis never painted but is frequently decorated with thumb marks andespecially with grooves running parallel with the border.Ivory implements were encountered first at Bonasila and consisted ofa few fine long points barbed on one side, looking like those of theEskimo and probably of Eskimo origin. There were also a few tools ofbone, generally scrapers.Russian beads, especially those of the large blue variety, areoccasionally encountered, usually singly or in small numbers,especially in some spots.A unique archeological specimen from the lower middle portion of theYukon Valley is the large stone dish obtained by Mr. Müller, the traderat Kaltag. (See p. 34.)Besides these random specimens, other cultural objects are foundalong the Yukon in connection with old burials. These consist of anoccasional wooden dish, sharpening or polishing stones, rarely afigurine (doll?) in ivory, Russian snuffboxes, fire sticks, dishes ofbirch bark, etc. The cullings in this field are quite poor, but therehas been no excavation of older burials that have been assimilated bythe tundra and lie now in the earth beneath.The archeology of the old habitation sites, on the other hand,particularly perhaps on the Shageluk and between Holy Cross andMarshall, is decidedly promising and invites careful excavation.LOCATION OF VILLAGES AND SITES ON THE YUKONEspecial attention was given to the location of the numerous deadvillages and older sites along the Yukon. This task was found, inmost instances, fairly easy with villages that "died" since theRusso-American occupation, for mostly they still show plain traces andare generally remembered by the old Indians or even old white settlers.Their precise allocation on a map, however, is not always easy orcertain. As to the prehistoric sites the search is much more difficultand depends largely on chance discoveries.The villages still existing give only a partial clue, in many cases,to the old, even where these bore the same name, for on occasions avillage changed its location, though remaining in the same generalvicinity and retaining the same name. Thus there existed at differenttimes apparently, between the earliest contacts with whites and thepresent, at least 2 Nuklukhayets, 2 Lowdens, 3 Nulatos, 3 Kaltags, 2Anviks, etc.; besides which there were differences in recording thenames and changes due to efforts at translation of the native term, oran application by the whites of a new name, often that of a trader orsettler, to an old site.In places even late village sites, in others burials, were witnessedbeing undermined by the river or the sea. Such sites with theircontents will probably sooner or later be completely lost from thiscause. Many doubtless have thus been lost previously.The villages and sites located along the Yukon are here enumerated andas far as possible charted. Information about them was obtained fromthe older Indians or river Eskimo and from such whites as had directknowledge in that line. Most of these sites were examined personally,but in some instances this was impossible. The details concerning thoseseen will be found in the Narrative, but a few generalizations may herebe useful.[Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 9_a_, My "spoils," loaded on sled, Point Hope.

They aregenerally located at the mouth, of some inland stream that carriesclear fresh water, particularly if on the other side there is theprotection of a hill. The dwellings were invariably on a flat and werethroughout semisubterranean and of the same general type; which appliesalso to the larger communal houses or "cashims." The sites can often betold from afar in summer by the rich grass that covers them.[Illustration: FIGURE 4.--The Yukon from below Koyukuk to Lofkas]The burials were as a rule not far from a village and preferably onthe slopes of the nearest hill. They were mostly above ground, butunder the influence of Russians there were also shallow-ground burials.The latter can readily be told by the sawed planks of the coffins andthe iron nails by which they are fastened. In many places no surfaceburials remain or there are mere traces. In such, places little moundsmay betray old burials assimilated by the tundra. Trenching in likelyspots would doubtless reveal others of which no trace remains on thesurface.[Illustration: FIGURE 5.--Old map of the Nulato district]No excavations of any of these sites have ever been attempted, but manyof the surface burials were disturbed or destroyed by seekers of relicsand the curious vandal, who is present on the Yukon as in other partsof the country.[Illustration: FIGURE 6.--Map of Kaltag and vicinity. (By McLeod)]The maps shown here were made under my direction on the basis ofmaps and charts provided by the Geological and Geodetic Surveys, inWashington. Additional old sites will doubtless be located in thefuture and may be added to these records.PRE-RUSSIAN SITES[Illustration: FIGURE 7.--The Yukon from Bystraia to below Holy Cross]As already told in the Narrative, a search for truly ancient sitesalong the Yukon has proven largely negative. A more intense andprolonged archeological survey, with exploratory trenches whereverthere is promise, may one day prove more fruitful. But, as pointed outbefore, much can never be expected. Man could at no time have occupiedthe Yukon Valley and watershed in large numbers. He would not havefound enough sustenance. Even with fair resources he would hardly havetarried in these inclement regions as long as the ways toward the southwere open. He never built here of lasting materials and had littlechance to develop or even keep up any higher culture, and since he isgone the ever-cutting river has taken away whatever it could reach andscattered it through its silts and gravels. There is nevertheless anumber of small elevated plateaus along the right bank that ought tobe sounded by exploratory pits or trenches, particularly perhaps wherethere are traces of later habitations.[Illustration: FIGURE 8.--The Yukon from above Holy Cross to belowMountain Village][Illustration: FIGURE 9.--The Yukon from below Mountain Village to nearMarshall]There are, of course, some sites that are older than others. The mostinteresting of these was found at Bonasila, beneath the old site ofMakki or Magimute, 18 miles downstream from Anvik. (See Narrative.) Themain facts concerning this site are as follows:[Illustration: FIGURE 10.--The Yukon from near Marshall to belowKavlingnak]At the above distance from Anvik, on the right bank of the river andfollowing a wooded hill, is a low flat backed by rising ground and cutacross by a little stream. The flat is narrow, at present about 300feet; and the part above the stream is deeply pitted by the remains ofsemisubterranean houses of a "dead" native village, which I believe isidentifiable with the Magimute of the Russians. On the slope behindthe village were still about a score of old surface burials, with anarticle here and there of Russian derivation.The bank of the flat rises at present only about 4 feet above the beachof the river, but the flat behind is higher. The bank itself containsmany specimens showing human workmanship, consisting of objects ofstone, birch bark, bone, and rarely also of ivory, besides manyfragments of pottery, many bones of wild Alaskan animals, and here andthere a human skeleton. Some of these objects are low down in the bank.All the bones from the bank, including the human, and even the rarepoints of ivory, are semifossilized; the stone industry is peculiar;and the human remains differ plainly from both those of the later YukonIndian and from those of the Eskimo. They are apparently Indian (seesection on physical characteristics), but a tall Indian of a type thatnow is only met with much farther south.[Illustration: FIGURE 11.--From above Kobolunuk to mouth of river]The stone industry from the bank appeared at first sight so primitivethat even the term "paleolithic" would not fit and the only termthat seemed to meet the situation was "protolithic." It consistspredominantly of scrapers and knockers, with here and there a toolsharpened for cutting. The scrapers look especially crude. They consistsimply of pieces of smaller or larger andesite-like volcanic slabsbroken to the desired size and chipped more or less roughly along whatwas to be the scraping edge. A closer examination of the stones, whichwere obtained from a base of a cliff farther down the river, showed,however, that they were of material which is hard to work, and that thechipping, under the circumstances, was not really bad. (Pls. 11, 12.)Pottery must have been fairly plentiful and quite up to the average ofthe river, both in make and decoration.Two fine long, partly fossilized ivory points picked up formerly on thesite were obtained from Mr. Lawrence. They are handsomely barbed onone side and show a high grade of skill. They must have come from theBering Sea and may belong to the old fine ivory culture of the westernpart of that region, of which more later.There are also some fairly ancient sites farther down the river (seeNarrative), but just what they are and how old remains to be determined.A report on the archeological remains from the bank of Bonasila by Mr.H. W. Krieger, one of the curators of the Department of Anthropology,United States National Museum, follows:ARCHEOLOGY OF CENTRAL ALASKAANCIENT STONE CULTURE"Until the results of Doctor Hrdlička's Alaskan reconnaissance werefirst made known to science it had been generally assumed that Alaskanand Canadian subboreal regions were archeologically barren. It had beencurrently accepted that only as one approached the great river valleysof the Skeena, the Fraser, and the Columbia could anthropologicalexploration be conducted to advantage. One might expect to uncovercemeteries and ancient village sites only there where a dense andsedentary population had long been established. Through the discoveryof ancient village sites and centers of population in the lower andmiddle Yukon River Valley, Doctor Hrdlička has extended the northernarcheological horizon into the sub-Arctic."Of the many sites examined, the old village site at Bonasila, 18 milesbelow the confluence of the Anvik and Yukon Rivers, yielded the mostinteresting data. Crudely flaked implements of trap rock with cuttingedges showing evidence of chipping and grinding were uncovered. Theseimplements are unique among Alaskan artifacts and have no relationshipwith known types of Eskimo or Indian stonework. In the shaping technicemployed by their aboriginal makers; in form, and in type; and,generally, in their undeveloped character, the stone artifacts fromBonasila and other ancient archeological sites on the middle Yukon maybe classified as primitive neolithic."The stone implements uncovered at Bonasila are so crudely fashionedand are apparently of such an improvised nature as to suggest anextreme conservatism in culture development, or perhaps a degeneration,due largely to lack of better materials. Due to the lack of basalt,jadeite, or other hard stone in the valley of the lower middle Yukon,recourse was had to sandstone and trap rock by the primitive makers ofstone axes and celts."Crude pottery vessels and potsherds were discovered associated withthe objects of stone. This ware incorporates elementary decorativedesigns distinct from the known historic Eskimo or Indian types ofpottery decoration. There can be no intimation that this ware isarchaic or that it belongs to any archaic culture offshoot from farthersouth. It therefore becomes a question of some unknown earlier Asiaticculture connection that manifested itself in crude forms of flaked andground stone implements and in unique pottery forms. It is uncertainthat the ancient fossil ivory culture of northwest Alaska, of whichDoctor Hrdlička has brought in some excellent examples, is in anymanner associated with the primitive neolithic stone and pottery formsuncovered at Bonasila. It is established, however, beyond a doubt thatboth cultures and types of artifacts are Asiatic in origin and havelittle or no connection with the culture of the western Eskimo."The Eskimos of the lower Yukon Valley made extensive use of slate andof jadeite in the production of their polished knives and celts. Slateknives and polished celts of jadeite are characteristic of Eskimoanculture throughout the whole of its extent in Alaska. Each of thesematerials as well as the finished products shaped from them weresubjects of native barter. Eskimos often undertook long journeys fortheir procurement. It is therefore noteworthy that no single objectfashioned from slate or jadeite and but few points of fossilized ivorywere recovered at any of the sites characterized by the primitive stoneculture and pottery of the Bonasila type."The most characteristic finds at Bonasila are the crudely flakedimplements of stone, some of which show incipient chipping andgrinding. The coarse type of pottery is unlike that of the modernEskimo in tempering, firing, and decorative design."The stone culture of the site, although rich in forms, is deficientin technical development and is scarcely worthy of being classedas neolithic. There were found in numbers the following types ofartifacts: Circular, discoidal stone pebbles with rim fractures due touse; river wash pebbles of irregular form used as improvised scrapersand hammerstones; basaltic, discoidal hammerstones with abraded edgesand pitted at the center; large flake saws of trachyte (trap rock)triangular in section but provided with sharply fractured cuttingedges; slender flaked fragments of trap rock tapered to the form ofwedges with intentionally worked end sections and cutting edges;crudely flaked stone knives with evidence of secondary chipping atcutting edges; other knives of thin slabs of trap rock with flakedand bilaterally ground beveled cutting edges; oblong axes of flakedsandstone with hafting notches struck off at the edges midway from thebase; abrading tools of sandstone; celts of sandstone with ground andbeveled working edge and notched for hafting as an ax; stone scraperswith ground and beveled cutting edges; fragmentary perforators ofstone; re-chipped, flaked knives shaped by grinding; roughly worked,multiple-grooved hammers or mauls; and many stone objects unformed andunworked but classified generally as hammerstones.THE POTTERY"About a hundred pottery shards and smaller pottery vessels wererecovered from the site at Bonasila. Pottery vessels representative ofthe Bonasila culture were shaped out of the solid and show no trace ofcoiling. In this respect they conform to the generalized north Asiaticand Eskimo ware. There is, however, no check stamp decorative designthat is applied with a paddle by the Eskimo nor evidence that potteryvessels had been built up about a basketry base. The paste is lightbuff or gray in color, the buff ware being better fired and of the samecolor on the inside, while the gray ware is either gray or black onthe inner surface. A well-defined unfired area covers one-half of thesectional diameter. Both buff and gray wares show evidence of betterfiring than in modern Eskimo pottery. Tempering is of coarse fragmentsof steatite, which is much more durable than tempering materials suchas blood, feathers, and ashes formerly employed by the primitive Eskimopotter."The pottery from Bonasila is utilitarian and consists of shallowspherical lamps, globose bowls, and cooking pots without feet orbases. The ware is coarse, side walls and bottom varying from 1 to 2centimeters in sectional thickness. This type of pottery is practicallyduplicated in shards recovered by Doctor Hrdlička from what is nowEskimo territory in the Yukon Valley near the Russian Mission. Itis probable that further search would bring to light an extensiveregion yielding this type of ancient pottery of distinctive design andunrelated either to Tinné or Eskimo ware."Decorative attempts consist of bold incised parallel transverselines on the upper sector of the outer surface of the vessel. Deepcorrugations appear on the inside of the rim flare. Both corrugationsand incised line decorations were made with a paddle or wood splintershaped for the purpose. Some of the shards have deeply incisedpunctations irregularly encircling the outer surface of the vessel justbelow the rim extension."Shallow spherical pottery lamps accompanied surface burials atBonasila. These lamps have a less durable tempering material than theother pottery fragments recovered. The paste is porous and is poorlyfired. Decorative designs incised on the interior surface of the lampsare reminiscent of typical Eskimo punctate designs as traced on theinner circumference of rectilinear or curvilinear etchings on ivory andbone. It is very probable that these pottery lamps are of a later dateand are of Eskimoan handicraft.THE ALASKAN GROOVED STONE AX[Pl. 10]"The grooved stone ax is a typical New World implement. Itsdistribution is limited to tribes of the eastern maize area, thePueblo tribes of the Southwest, the Athapascans, and the northernwoodlands tribes. Elsewhere in America grooved stone implements ofany description are rare, although not unknown. The groove for theattachment of cord or sinew binding is common also to the stone adze,which is characteristic of Indian tribes of the Pacific Northwestand of the Eskimo of Arctic America. The distribution of the stoneadze is more intensive but is much less extensive than is that of thegrooved stone ax and appears to be an environmental form borrowed fromthe Arctic tribes by the Indian of southeast Alaska and of BritishColumbia."The double-bitted, multiple-grooved stone ax has two areas ofdistribution in North America. One of these is the country of thenortheastern woodlands Indians, extending as far south as the CentralAtlantic States. The other area of distribution is the extremenorthwest, or the mainland of Alaska."In the collection brought to the National Museum from Alaska byDoctor Hrdlička are eight grooved stone implements. All but one ofthese have cutting edges for use as axes or adzes. The exception,Cat. No. 332809, U.S.N.M., is a grooved spherical stone maul or club9.5 centimeters (3.7 inches) long and 7.5 centimeters (2.9 inches)in sectional diameter. This grooved object was found near Tanana onthe beach of the Yukon River. Like the grooved stone axes in DoctorHrdlička's collection, the groove is incomplete. A flattened spaceof approximately 2 centimeters is left un-grooved for the hafting ofa flat surfaced handle end with binding, which is passed around thetransverse groove and then through a hole in the wooden handle."Three single-grooved, double-bitted stone axes were collected fromvarious points on the Yukon River. These are of interest because oftheir similar grooving and double cutting edges. Each is identical inform, each has been shaped by pecking, except in the sector near thecutting edges where they have been sharpened and polished by grinding.Between the raised borders of the centrally pecked groove and thecutting edges the surface has been shaped to a slight concavity bypecking. In Cat. No. 332805, U.S.N.M., this concavity is replaced by awell-defined convex bevel. The pecked groove is at right angles to thelongitudinal axis and is comparatively shallow but has a wide diameterof 2 centimeters or more. The material is uniformly of basalt. The axesare 20 centimeters or more long, while the sectional diameter variesfrom 6 to 10 centimeters according to whether the ax is flattened oroval in section."Grooved, double-bitted stone axes similar to those collected by DoctorHrdlička from the Middle Yukon region have since become known also fromstations farther south in Alaska. One was plowed up in a field nearMatanuska and is now in the chamber of commerce exhibit at Anchorage,while another was collected in 1927 by the writer from near Chitna,Alaska. This Alaskan type of grooved ax is practically identical withthat of the central Atlantic seaboard States, as figured by WalterHough in the Proceedings of the United States National Museum, volume60, article 9, page 14."Another grooved type of stone object brought to the National Museumby Doctor Hrdlička is a stone war club of unusual type. It was foundon the Yukon River beach 1½ miles below the Mission at Tanana. Itis 20 centimeters (7.9 inches) long and is slender, the maximumsectional diameter being but 3.5 centimeters (1.4 inches). Like thesingle-grooved axes, it was shaped by pecking, but much of the surfacewas also ground. The reverse or hafting surface is flat; the obverse isconvexly tapered to sharp cutting edges which are at right angles tothe haft. The material is basalt. The hafting grooves, two in number,are comparatively deep and closely spaced. As to form this stone weaponis unique, appearing, so far as is known to the writer, nowhere elseon the American Continent. It has been entered on the records of theNational Museum as Cat. No. 332807, U.S.N.M."One form of the double-bitted, multiple-grooved stone axes resemblesclosely ivory forms made from walrus tusks in the Bering Sea region.This form also gives evidence of secondary modification, specimenshaving been broken intentionally to reduce the tool to a simple adze.The material is basalt and its range in the north is limited to theEskimo area, but becomes widespread to the south in southeastern Alaskaand in British Columbia. The form of this widely diffused stone adzeis approximated in a series of broken stone axes collected by DoctorHrdlička. Two such broken and originally double-bitted axes, Cat. Nos.332806 and 332810, U.S.N.M., were collected from the banks of the Yukonat an old village site below Anvik. These axes are broken with a crudeirregular fracture just above the upper transverse groove. Anotherstone ax, Cat. No. 332812, U.S.N.M., is from Ruby, Alaska, and ispractically identical with the double-bitted but single-grooved stoneax from Tanana."It would appear from this brief presentation that there is aremarkable similarity of form, approaching identity, in the ancientstone axes from the river valleys of central Alaska. Whether theparticular ax has one cutting edge or is double-bitted; whether it isprovided with one or with two parallel transverse hafting grooves, thegeneral identity of form remains. The striking thing about the presenceof the double-bitted ax among archeological finds from central Alaskais that we do not find it represented in such numbers anywhere until itagain reappears in the Atlantic seaboard States. The very interestingcultural objects discovered by Doctor Hrdlička and supplemented bymy collection in 1927 show that Alaska is far from sterile or fullyknown archeologically and make further exploration both promising andimportant."ANTHROPOLOGY OF THE YUKONNotes on the physique of the Yukon natives are found in the reportsof all the explorers of the river, but they are imperfect and oflittle scientific value; the principal ones are given below.[26]Anthropometric observations on the living people of the middle andlower Yukon, with its tributaries, are nonexistent.[27] As to crania,there are a few measurements on two "Yukon Indian" skulls (No. 7530,and probably No. 7531), and on three crania of the Yukon Eskimo, byJeffries Wyman (Proc. Bost. Soc. Nat. Hist., 1868, XI, 452); on one"Ingaleet" and three "Mahlemut" or Norton Sound Eskimo skulls by GeorgeA. Otis (List of Specimens, etc., 35); and on four skulls collectedby Dall, one from Nulato and the rest presumably from St. Michael, byHrdlička (Catal. of Crania, p. 30, Nos. 242925, 242899, 242901, 242936).FOOTNOTES:[26] Glazunof (Wrangell, Stat. und Ethnog. Nachr., 146-147): "The menare big, brunette, with bristly black hair."Zagoskin (pt. II, 61-62): "The Tinneh belong in general to the Americanfamily of redskins, but marked external differences are perceptiblein those who are mixed with the Eskimo. The Tinneh are of mediumstature, rather dry but well shaped, with oblong face, forehead medium,upright, frequently hairy, nose broad and straight, hooked, eyes blackand dark brown, rather large * * * expression intelligent, in thoseof more distant tribes somber, roving; lips full, compressed; teethwhite, straight; hair straight, black to dark brown, fairly soft; manyof the men hairy over the body and with fairly thick, short mustacheand beard; hands and feet medium, calves small; in general lively,communicative, cheerful, and very fond of pleasure and song."Dall, William H., Alaska and Its Resources, 53-54: "The Ingaliks are,as a rule, tall, well made, but slender. They have very long, squarelyoval faces, high, prominent cheek bones, large ears, small mouths,noses, and eyes, and an unusually large lower jaw. The nose is wellformed and aquiline, but small in proportion to the rest of the face.The hair is long, coarse, and black, and generally parted in themiddle. * * * Their complexion is an ashy brown, perhaps from dirt inmany cases, and they seldom have much color. On the other hand, theKoyúkuns, with the same high cheek bones and piercing eyes, have muchshorter faces, more roundly oval, of a pale olive hue, and frequentlyarched eyebrows and a fine color. They are the most attractive inappearance of the Indians in this part of the territory, as they arethe most untamable. The women especially are more attractive than thoseamong the Ingaliks, whose square faces and ashy complexion render thelatter very plain, not to say repulsive." (Some of these statementswere evidently somewhat in error.--A. H.)Schwatka, F. (Milit. Reconn. (1883), Comp. Narr. Explor. Alas., 350):"As regards these Ingaliks as a class, they are, as a rule, of averageheight, tolerably well built, but slender, differing in this respectfrom the natives farther down the river. They have long black hair anda complexion brown by nature, but often verging toward black on accountof a liberal covering of dirt."See also Richardson, J. (Arctic Search. Exp., I, 379).

XIV, pp. 53-68, 1901).THE LIVING INDIANNotes on the living Indians of the Yukon have already been given in theNarrative. They will be briefly summarized in this place. Measurementsof the living were impracticable during the journey.[Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 13TANANA INDIAN WOMAN][Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 14CHIEF SAN JOSEPH, NEAR TANANA VILLAGE, ON THE YUKON(A.

The mixture is especially evident in the children and theyounger generation. It is mainly that with whites, but in the lowersettlements there is also a good deal of older mixture with the Eskimo.There is fortunately as yet no Negro admixture._General type._--The full bloods are typically Indian, though not ofthe pronounced plains type. The type is fairly uniform, but there isnot seldom, even up the river, as elsewhere in Alaska, a suggestion ofsomething Eskimoid in the physiognomy._Color._--The color in general is near medium brown, ranging to lighterrather than darker. The hair is the usual full black of the Indian._Stature and strength._--- The stature and build are generally nearmedium, rather slightly below than above._Head form._--The head is generally moderately rounded high meso- tomoderately brachycephalic. The face is medium Indian._Body._--The body proportions seldom impress one with unusual strength,yet some of the men are by no means weaklings. The most fitting termby which to characterize conditions in this respect is again "medium,"with an occasional deviation one way or the other._Photographs._--The accompanying photographs, taken by the writer fromTanana to Anvik, show a few of the physiognomies. Some of the girls andwomen, as well as boys and men, are quite good looking. (Pls. 13-18.)From Anvik downward along the river the type of the people becomesplainly more Eskimoid and on the whole more robust. But as one canfrequently meet farther up the river individuals who remind one more orless of the Eskimo, so here it is frequent to see faces that look likeIndian. Whether due to old mixture or to other reason, the fact is thatthere is no line of somatological demarcation in the living populationsof the river, and the same applies, as will be seen later, to theskulls.SKELETAL REMAINS OF THE YUKONThe first Yukon Indian skull measured was that of a half-chief ofthe Nulato group, collected in the early sixties by William H. Dall.There are now three records of this skull, originally and again now aSmithsonian specimen, one in Wyman ("Observations on Crania," Proc.Bost. Soc. Nat. Hist., 1868, XI, 452, No. 7530), one in the Otis"Catalogue" (35, No. 259), and one in Hrdlička's "Catalogue of HumanCrania in the United States National Museum Collections" (p. 30, No.242925). It is a normal, well-developed male skull, which gives nosuggestion of mixture. The true measurements of this "type" specimen,taken by present-day instruments and methods, are as follows:      _Yukon Indian skull No. 242925_  Vault:    Length                       cm  18.4    Breadth                      cm  14    Height to bregma             cm  13.8    Cranial index                   _76.1_    Mean height index               _85.2_    Height-breadth index            _98.6_    Cranial module     (mean diameter)             cm  15.40    Cranial capacity          c. c.  1,520  Face:    Menton-nasion (teeth but      slightly worn)             cm  12.1    Alveolar point-nasion        cm   7.3    Diameter bizygomatic      maximum                    cm  14    Facial index, total             _86.4_    Facial index, upper             _52.1_  Facial angle                       69°  Alveolar angle                     53.5°  Orbits:    Right--      Height                     cm   3.25      Breadth                    cm   4.2    Left--      Height                     cm   3.45      Breadth                    cm   4    Mean index                      _81_  Nose:    Height                       cm   5.1    Breadth                      cm   2.5    Index                           _49_  Upper alveolar arch:    Length                       cm   5.7    Breadth                      cm   6.7    Index                           _85.1_  Basio-facial diameters:    Basion-alveolar point        cm  10.6    Basion-subnasal point        cm   9.4    Basal-nasion                 cm  10.5The skull is seen to be mesocephalic, rather high, and of good braincapacity; the face is of medium Indian proportions; the orbits areunequal, rather low; the nose is of medium height and breadth; theupper dental arch, the basic-facial diameters, and the facial andalveolar angles, are all near medium Indian.There was another Indian skull in the five Wyman reported, but itsidentity is uncertain. A later collection by Dall included three Indianfemale crania from Alaska, but their exact provenience is uncertain;their measurements are given in my catalogue.On the 1926 trip I succeeded in collecting directly from the burialsalong the lower middle Yukon 17 adult skulls and skeletons. Suchmaterial is both scarce and difficult to obtain, due to the attitudeof the Indians. All the specimens in the collection are from theRussian times on the river. A few of the skulls show traces of Eskimoidin their features, but none offer a suspicion of a mixture with thewhites. The measurements are given below. They partly agree, partlydisagree, with those of the Nulato skull. The vault, the breadth ofthe nose, the dimensions of the dental arch, are much alike, but theheight of the face, nose, and orbits in the Nulato specimen is somewhatlower. These may be tribal but also simply individual differences.We may generalize by stating that the lower middle Yukon Indian wasmesocephalic, with a fairly high vault, and moderate capacity.

Forpresent purposes it will suffice to take the males alone and torestrict consideration to the long bones. The essential data on theseare given on page 160, where they are contrasted with those of NorthAmerican Indians in general, and with those of the western Eskimo.The bones show both relations to as well as differences from the bonesof Indians in general and fair distinctness from those of the Eskimo.Contrasted with the long bones of miscellaneous North American tribestaken together, the Yukon Indian bones show absolutely slightlyshorter humerus (or arm), somewhat shorter radius (or forearm), aslightly shorter femur (or upper part of the leg), and a plainlyshorter tibia. These Indians had therefore relatively somewhat shorterforearm and especially the leg below the knees than their continentalcousins. These facts are plainly evident from the radio-humeral andtibio-femoral indices of the two groups. In this relative shortness ofthe distal parts of the limbs the Yukon Indian approaches the Eskimo,standing near midway between the Indian in general and the Eskimo.There might be a ready temptation to attribute this to a mixture withthe Eskimo; but an examination of the records will show that the samecondition, so far at least as the upper limb is concerned (lower?), isalready present in the old Bonasila skeleton, which gives no suggestionof an Eskimo mixture. It is more likely, therefore, that these aregeneralized characteristics of functional origin such as a considerableuse of the small canoes. This view seems to be supported by therelative strength of the bones. In the Yukon Indian the humerus isstouter, the femur of the same strength, and the tibia very perceptiblyweaker than they are in Indians in general. In the Eskimo, with evengreater dependence on the canoe, both the humerus and the femur arenotably stouter, while the tibia is weaker, than are similar bones inthe Indians in general.The humero-femoral index in the Yukon Indians is unusually high,indicating a relative shortness of the femur. This character is notpresent in the Eskimo, nor in the continental Indian. It is probablyalso of old functional origin, though, this for the present must remaina mere suggestion.All of this shows clearly the interest and value of other skeletalparts than the skull, and particularly of the long bones, foranthropological studies.SKELETAL REMAINS FROM THE BANK AT BONASILAThe skeletal material from the bank at Bonasila consists now ofportions of three adult skulls, one male and two females, and of 13bones of the male skeleton. All the specimens are more or less stainedby manganese and iron and all are distinctly heavier than normal,showing some grade of fossilization. They closely resemble in all theserespects the numerous animal bones from the bank and in all differ fromthe later surface burials of the place.THE CRANIAThe male skull, No. 332513, is represented by the frontal bone unitedwith a larger part of the face, a separated left temporal, and theright half of the lower jaw. A large Inca bone, recovered from thebeach a year later, may also belong to the same specimen. The missingparts are probably still somewhere in the sands of the beach wherethere is going on a very instructive scattering and redeposition on a 4to 6 feet lower level of the contents of the old bank.The skull is that of a male of somewhat over 50 years of age, judgingfrom the moderate to marked wear of the remaining teeth. It is a normalundeformed specimen, and the same applies to the bones of the skeleton._Notes and measurements._--The frontal shows a medium development, noslope. The supraorbital ridges are rather weakly developed for a male,leaving the upper borders of the orbits rather sharp.                               Cm.  Diameter frontal minimum      9.75  Diameter frontal maximum     11.8  Diameter nasion-bregma       11.5The skull as a whole was evidently mesocephalic, and neither low norvery high. The thickness of the frontal is about medium for an Indian.The face is of medium proportions and strength, with rather largeorbits, good interorbital breadth, medium malars, medium broad nose,and but moderate alveolar prognathism. The nasal bridge is not high,nasal bones fairly broad, spine moderate, lower borders well definedthough not sharp. The sub-malar (canine) fossae are shallow.                              _Measurements_  Alveolar point-nasion height       cm  7.8  Facial breadth about medium    for an Indian.

The teeth are of good medium size._Skull No. 333383._--Of this skull I brought the right parietalwith about one-third of the frontal; Mr. Krieger, a year later, theremainder of the frontal. Other parts are missing.The specimen was evidently, a good-size female skull, normal,undeformed, probably mesocephalic in form, and moderately high.

The specimen is that of a young adult female. The bones,rather submedium in thickness, indicate a skull of slightly smallersize and slightly shorter than the preceding but of much the samegeneral type._The skeletal parts of male No. 332513._--Humeri: The long bones allgive the impression of straightness, length, and of a certain gracilityof form combined with strength, but without massiveness.

The firstrib approaches the semicircular in type and is rather large, indicatinga spacious chest. Otherwise there is nothing special.A comparison of the long bones of this interesting skeleton with thoseof the later Indians from the same and near-by localities as well aswith those of the western Eskimo (see table, p. 160) shows a number ofstriking conditions. The length of the bones of the skeleton is farabove the mean of both those of Indians and the Eskimo, indicating astature of at least 10 centimeters (4 inches) higher. In none of theircharacteristics are the bones near to those of the Eskimo, making itdoubly certain that the subject was not of that affiliation. Comparedwith those of the later Indians of the same territory, the bones showin one line remarkable differences, in another remarkable likenesses.The differences concern all the relative proportions of the shafts--thebones of the old skeleton give without exception indices that aremarkedly lower; they are distinctly more platybrachic, platymeric,and platycnaemic. But the more basic humero-femoral and radio-humeralindices are practically the same; showing fundamental identity. Thehumero-femoral index is especially important in this case. It isexceptionally high in the Yukon Indians, due to a relatively longhumerus, and the same condition is seen in the old skeleton. It seemssafe, therefore, to conclude that the owner of the old skeleton wasnot only an Indian but an Indian of the same physical stock from whichwere derived the later Indians of the Yukon; but he was evidently ofan earlier and different tribe or of a purer derivation than those whofollowed. To more fully establish and then trace this type, both as toits derivation and extension, will be tasks of future importance.

Collins, jr., succeeded in measuring six adult males atMarshall.In general, the people of the Yukon delta and from this to Paimuteare true Eskimo. By this is meant that in the majority of individualsthey can readily be told as a type apart from the Indian and belongingplainly to that of the extensive family of the Eskimo. But when thedifferences are to be defined the task is not easy; some of thedistinguishing marks, though well appreciated, are somewhat intangible.The physical differences are essentially those of the physiognomy. Thehead is neither narrow nor scaphoid, or even very high. The Indianface is more prominent and more sculptured; that of the Eskimo appearsfuller, especially in the lower part, and flatter. Part of this isdue to the bony structure, part to the differing amounts of fat. Aneversion of the angles of the lower jaw, which is relatively frequentand sometimes excessive in the Eskimo male while almost absent in theIndian, may give the Eskimo face almost a square appearance. Takewith this the seemingly somewhat low Eskimo forehead, the not verywidely open and somewhat on the whole more slanting eye, and thecharacteristic Eskimo nose with its rather narrow and not prominentnasal bridge, the ridiculous monk-like cut of the hair (in the oldermales), the often rather full lips with, in the males, a tuft of sparsemustache above each corner of the mouth; add to all this a mostlysmiling or ready-to-smile "full-moon" expression, and it would beimpossible to take the subject for anything else than an Eskimo. TheIndian's face is more set, less fat, in the males at least, less broadbelow, with seemingly a higher forehead, sensibly made-up hair, notseldom a bit more mustache, and a nose that generally is both broaderand more prominent.But the differences are less marked in the women and still less so inthe children, especially where similarly combed and clothed. And thereare, particularly on the Yukon, not a few of both Indian and Eskimowho even an expert is at a loss where to class. They may be due to oldmixtures; no new ones are taking place; but it seems that there may bepresent another important factor, that of a far-back related parentage.In the color of the skin and eyes, in the color and nature of the hair,there is no marked difference between the two peoples of the Yukon. Instature the Eskimos are slightly higher.MEASUREMENTS ON LIVING YUKON ESKIMOThe exact provenience of the six men measured at Marshall is uncertain,but they seemingly were all from the lower Yukon and all wereapparently full-blood Eskimo. But the measurements are rather peculiar.They are given, for comparison, with those of the western Eskimoin general (p. 165). They approach nearest to those of the TogiakEskimo, well down below the Kuskokwim. They show a higher staturethan all of their relations farther south, except the Togiaks, andthey have a rounder head. They are, in fact, moderate brachycephals,a very unexpected form in this strain of people. The Togiaks alsoare brachycephalic. The vault is relatively somewhat higher than itis in the other groups, though the height is not excessive. The noseis slightly lower as well as narrower than it is in all the othercontingents. The face is close to those of St. Lawrence Island. Theear is perceptibly smaller and especially narrower than elsewhere, butperhaps the age factor enters into the case. The hand is much like thatof Togiak and St. Lawrence, the index being identical.The brachycephaly of the group for the present is hard to explain. Itcan not be ascribed to a mixture with the river Indians, for these, ashas been seen from the skulls, were meso- rather than brachycephalic.There is need here for further inquiry.SKELETAL REMAINS OF YUKON ESKIMOAs with the Indian, such remains are still rare. Some measurementsof three "Smithsonian Mahlemute" skulls from the Yukon, collected byWilliam H. Dall, are given by Jeffries Wyman, and probably the samespecimens appear in the Otis Catalogue, the measurements in which areregrettably not very reliable. These specimens can not now be located,and the scarce data are of but little value. The three skulls examinedby Wyman were all mesocephalic.It is now possible to report on 40 adult skulls from the lower Yukonand the delta. An abstract of the measurements is given in thenext table. The data indicate a considerable local variation. Allthe skulls, or very nearly all, are mesocephalic; but they differconsiderably in height and in all the facial features. The PilotStation group, from the apex of the delta, and hence the midst of theEskimo territory on the Yukon, is especially peculiar. Both the vaultand the face, in the series as a whole, range from low to high, andmuch the same is true of the height of the nose and that of the orbits,while the palate is exceptionally broad, giving a low index, all ofwhich would seem to indicate instability or conditions in change,together probably with admixtures from farther up the river. We needmore material, particularly from the stretch of the river between theapex of the delta and Paimute.

P. I. Delon.[44] A. Hrdlička.SKELETAL PARTS OF THE YUKON ESKIMOThe next table gives the measurements of the long bones in both sexesin the Yukon Indian (for comparison), in the Yukon Eskimo, and in thewestern Eskimo, the latter coming mainly from the coast south of theYukon and from the Nunivak and St. Lawrence Islands. The Yukon Eskimomaterial, collected from intact burials by the writer, is unfortunatelylimited to the northern mouth of the river. The skeletons from St.Lawrence Island were collected on the Smithsonian expedition to theplace in 1912 by Riley D. Moore, 1927 expedition by H. B. Collins, jr.,and T. D. Stewart, all of the National Museum.The Yukon Eskimo show perceptibly longer bones than do either theIndians or the southeastern and midwestern Eskimo, indicating asomewhat taller stature.The humerus in the males is less broad than either in the Indians orthe midwestern and southwestern Eskimo and has as a consequence highshaft index; but in the females the index in the Yukon and westernEskimo series is identical. The radius is relatively even shorter inthe Yukon that it is in the other Eskimo, giving low radio-humeralindex.The femur is notably less platymeric in the male and slightly less soin the female Yukon Eskimo than it is in both the Indians and the restof the southwestern and midwestern Eskimo, giving a higher index at theupper flattening. The meaning of these facts is not obvious and theymay undergo some modification with more material.As to strength, measured by the mean diameter of the shafts, the YukonEskimo in comparison to the southwestern and midwestern show a slightlyweaker humerus, and in the males a slightly weaker femur at middle,but in the males again, a slightly stronger tibia. If, however, themean diameters of the bones are taken in relation to the length of thebones, then in both sexes and in all the parts the southwestern andmidwestern Eskimo are slightly stronger. This would seem to indicatemore exertion, with harder life, among the coastal and insular thanamong the river Eskimo. As a matter of fact Kotlik and the near-byPastolik, from which our skeletons came, were favorably situated at thenorthern mouth of the river.The Yukon Eskimo females, as compared with the males, have a somewhatweaker and especially somewhat flatter humerus, with a consequentlylower shaft index; they have relatively even a shorter radius, givinga lower radio-humeral index; their humerus itself is relatively short,giving a lower humero-femoral index; their femur is relatively somewhatflatter at the upper flattening, giving a lower index of platymery;while their tibia is relatively less strong antero-posteriorly,resulting in an index that is more than four points higher than that ofthe males.

Until the 1926 Smithsonian expedition nothing whatever hadbeen done in this line in the Eskimo parts of the southwestern coastsof Alaska[46] or on the Kuskokwim or Yukon Rivers.Some time between 1877 and 1881 E. W. Nelson made limited excavationson St. Michael Island[47] (see p. 170) and also dug on Whale Island.In 1912 V. Stefánsson excavated at Barrow.[48] Having two months tospend at this place he engaged numerous Eskimo of the village andhad them excavate the native village sites in the neighborhood. Hesays (p. 388): "It was a small army that turned out to dig whereverthere was a ruin or a kitchen midden, and they worked energeticallyand well. While the excavations were not done as methodically andscientifically as could have been wished, still we were able to getfrom them a collection of over 20,000 archaeological specimens withinthe space of six weeks. This collection (which is now safely stored inthe American Museum of Natural History) brings out many significantand some revolutionary ideas with regard to the prehistoric history ofthe Eskimo. My method was to dig as much as possible myself, and togo around as best I could to see the others at work. In many cases Iwas able to see the exact position from which the important finds weretaken." The specimens have since in part been described by Wissler.[49]Stefánsson brought also some archeological specimens from Point Hope,where, however, no excavations were made; and collected a valuableseries of crania from Point Barrow.In 1917-19 excavations near Barrow were conducted by W. B. Van Valin,leader of the John Wanamaker expedition to northwestern Alaska, forthe University Museum at Philadelphia. The excavations were made insome mounds located about 8 miles southwest of Barrow and about 1,000yards back from the beach on the tundra, and uncovered six old iglooscontaining, aside from many cultural objects, the skeletal remains of83 individuals. These remains have since been found to be those of anintrusive group of people and to be of special interest.[50]In 1924 Rasmussen during the last parts of his great journey gatherednumerous archeological specimens at Point Hope and from otherlocalities along the west coasts of Alaska.In 1926, finally, the year of my survey, some careful initialexcavations, with very interesting results, were carried on at Walesand on the Little Diomede Island by Dr. D. Jenness, of the NationalMuseum of Canada, Ottawa. A preliminary report on the results of thiswork has been published in the annual report of the National Museum ofCanada for 1926.Besides such more professional work a good deal of archeologicalcollection has been done in the regions under consideration by localpeople, particularly traders and teachers; and the demand for specimenshas made assiduous excavators of some of the Eskimo themselves,particularly at Point Hope and at St. Lawrence Island.Beginning with the north, the first white man to be mentioned inthis connection is Charles Brower, the well-known trader at Barrow.Mr. Brower has not only aided all the explorers who have reachedthis northernmost point, but he has also been directly instrumentalin excavating and the making of archeological collections, though,regrettably, some of these have been scattered.During 1925-26 there lived at Point Hope a very active and interestingman, sent there by the Fox Film Co. to photograph the Eskimo--Mr.Merle La Voy. La Voy, whom I met at Point Hope and who for a timebecame our fellow-passenger on the _Bear_, had not only succeededremarkably in his own line, but had also amassed during his stay alarge archeological collection. He did not excavate himself, andunfortunately paid no attention to the scientific side of the case; butby offering the natives sugar, tea, chocolate, chewing gum, tobacco,etc. in exchange for specimens, he so stimulated them that they engagedmost assiduously in the excavation, or rather picking over as theythawed, of their old ruins, and brought him thousands of objects, someof which are of considerable interest. At the time of my visit therewere several barrels full of specimens, largely of stone and ivory.Skulls and bones, regrettably, were neglected and reburied in thedébris. Later this collection was transported to San Francisco, whereit remains at the date of this writing, in Mr. La Voy's possession.At Kotzebue Mr. Tom Berryman, the trader, has made some collections ofEskimo archeological material, from which I benefited for the NationalMuseum; and the local teacher, Mr. C. S. Replogle, informed me that hehad a large collection at his home in the States.At Nome I found a valuable lot of specimens in fossil ivory, pottery,and stone, in the possession of the well-known Lomen brothers, membersof one of the foremost families in Alaska. The best parts of thiscollection I was fortunate to secure for exhibit in the United StatesNational Museum.A large and valuable collection of western Eskimo archeologicalmaterial was made some years ago by Dr. Daniel Neuman. A part of thiscollection is in the museum at Juneau; the whereabouts of the rest andof Doctor Neuman himself I was unable to discover. There are severalcollections of archeological material from the western Eskimo region atSeattle and San Francisco, but none represents scientific excavation.The names of Joe Bernard, Prof. H. N. Sverdrup, and O. W. Geist shouldbe mentioned in this connection, all having collected archeologicalobjects in the western Eskimo region. Many specimens of valuecollected by these men and others are in various museums or in privatehands in Fairbanks, along the west coast or in Europe.My own small part in the archeology of Bering Sea and the northwesterncoast of Alaska was, as already stated, mainly that of making a surveyof conditions. The object was to obtain a good general view of whatthere was in the line of archeological sites and remains, and thushelp to lay a foundation for more organized research in the future. Inaddition all possible effort was made to collect and obtain specimensof distinct archeological value. Both of these endeavors met withresults of some importance.FOOTNOTES:[46] Dall, W. H., and Jochelson, W., made, as is well known, valuableexcavations in the Aleutian Islands; but the Aleuts were not Eskimos.(See Cat. of Crania, etc., U.S.N.M., 1924, 39.)[47] Nelson, E.

Many of these dead villages or sites arehistoric, having been abandoned, or very nearly so, since the comingof the whites; some are older, in instances doubtless considerablyolder. Collectively they offer a large, almost wholly virginal andhighly important field to American archeology. They may contain much ofthe secrets of Eskimo origin and of his cultural, as well perhaps asphysical, evolution. But these secrets are not to be given up easily.They are held within a perpetually frozen ground, which on one handpreserves everything, but on the other will not yield its contentsexcept to assiduous and prolonged labor.Ruined or "dead" villages began to be encountered by the earliestRussian and other explorers. Beechey (1826) tells us that betweenapproximately the latitude of Nelson Island and Point Barrow (60° 34´to 71° 24´ N.) they noticed 19 (Eskimo) villages, some of which werevery small and consisted only of a few huts, and others appeared tohave been deserted a long time.[51]Hooper, in 1884, reports Eskimo ruins on the Asiatic side:"Near the extremity of the cape [Wankarem] we found the ruins of housessimilar to those now in use by the Innuits, half underground, withframes of the bones of whales. Probably they were former dwellingsof Innuits, who for some reason crossed the straits and attempted toestablish themselves on the Siberian side. These houses have been foundby different travelers at many places along this coast, and variouscauses assigned for the abandonment of the attempt to settle here bythe Innuits. * * *"At Cape Wankarem and at other places on the Siberian coast we foundthe ruins of houses similar to those now in use by the Innuits. Thesehouses, which have been found by different travelers at many placesalong that coast, are not at all like those used by the Tchuktchis,which, on account of the migratory habits of the reindeer tribes,are so constructed that they can be taken down and put up again atwill."[52]Ray and Murdoch both speak of old sites. The very spot they selectedfor their observatory at Barrow was one of these. Ray says of it:  "A point about 12 feet above the sea level, lying between the  sea and a small lagoon three-fourths of a mile northeast from  Uglaamie, was finally selected. The soil was firm and as dry as any  unoccupied place in that vicinity, and as it was marked by mounds  of an ancient village would be free from inundation."[53]And farther on:  "That the ancestors of those people have made it their home for  ages is conclusively shown by the ruins of ancient villages and  winter huts along the seashore and in the interior. On the point  where the station was established were mounds marking the site of  three huts dating back to the time when they had no iron and men  'talked like dogs'; also at Perigniak a group of mounds mark the  site of an ancient village. It stands in the midst of a marsh;  a sinking of the land causing it to be flooded and consequently  abandoned, as it is their custom to select the high and dry points  of land along the seashore for their permanent villages. The fact  of our finding a pair of wooden goggles 26 feet below the surface  of the earth, in the shaft sunk for earth temperatures, points  conclusively to the great lapse of time since these shores were  first peopled by the race of man."[54]The village of Sidaru, southwest of Cape Belcher, which in Ray's timehad a population of about 50, has since gone "dead."The most direct attention to this subject has been given by Nelson. Inhis excellent large memoir on "The Eskimo about Bering Strait"[55] hestates as follows:"Ruins of ancient Eskimo villages are common on the lower Yukonand thence along the coast line to Point Barrow. On the Siberianshore they were seen from East Cape along the Arctic coast to CapeWankarem...."On the shore of the bay on the southern side of St. Michael IslandI dug into an old village site where saucer-shape pits indicated theplaces formerly occupied by houses. The village had been burned, as wasevident from the numerous fragments of charred timbers mixed with thesoil. In the few cubic feet of earth turned up at this place were founda slate fish knife, an ivory spearhead, a doll, and a toy dish, thelatter two cut from bark. The men I had with me from the village at St.Michael became so alarmed by their superstitious feelings that I wasobliged to give up the idea of getting further aid from them in thisplace. I learned afterward that this village had been built by peoplefrom Pastolik, at the mouth of the Yukon, who went there to fish and tohunt seals before the Russians came to the country."On the highest point of Whale Island, which is a steep islet justoffshore near the present village of St. Michael, were the ruins of akashim and of several houses. The St. Michael people told me that thisplace was destroyed, long before the Russians came, by a war party frombelow the Yukon mouth. The sea has encroached upon the islet until aportion of the land formerly occupied by the village has been washedaway. The permanently frozen soil at this place stopped us at the depthof about 2 feet. Here, and at another ancient Unalit village sitewhich was examined superficially, we found specimens of bone and ivorycarvings which were very ancient, as many of them crumbled to pieces onbeing exposed."Along the lower Yukon are many indications of villages destroyed bywar parties. According to the old men these parties came from Askinukand Kushunuk, near the Kuskokwim, as there was almost constant warfarebetween the people of these two sections before the advent of theRussians."Both the fur traders and the Eskimo claim that there are a largenumber of house sites on the left bank of the Yukon,[56] a few milesbelow Ikogmut. This is the village that the Yukon Eskimo say had 35kashims, and there are many tales relating to the period when it wasoccupied. At the time of my Yukon trips this site was heavily coveredwith snow, and I could not see it; but it would undoubtedly well repaythorough excavation during the summer months. One of the traditionsis that this village was built by people from Bristol Bay, joined byothers from Nunivak Island and Kushunuk. One informant said thata portion of this village was occupied up to 1848, when the lastinhabitant died of smallpox, but whether or not this is true I wasunable to learn."Another informant told me that near the entrance of Goodnews Bay, nearthe mouth of the Kuskokwim, there is a circular pit about 75 feet indiameter, marking the former site of a very large kashim. A few milessouth of Shaktolik, near the head of Norton Sound, I learned of theexistence of a large village site. Both the Eskimo and the fur traderswho told me of this said that the houses had been those of Shaktolikpeople, and that some of them must have been connected by undergroundpassageways, judging from the ditch-like depressions from one to theother along the surface of the ground. The Shaktolik men who told methis said that there were many other old village sites about there andthat they were once inhabited by a race of very small people who haveall disappeared."From the Malemut of Kotzebue Sound and adjacent region I learned thatthere are many old village sites in that district. Many of these placeswere destroyed by war parties of Tinné from the interior, according tothe traditions of the present inhabitants."On Elephant Point, at the head of the Kotzebue Sound, I saw the siteof an old village, with about 15 pits marking the locations of thehouses. The pits sloped toward the center and showed by their outlinesthat the houses had been small and roughly circular, with a shortpassageway leading into them, the entire structure having been partlyunderground."The Eskimo of East Cape, Siberia, said that there were many oldvillage sites along the coast in that vicinity. These houses had stonefoundations, many of which are still in place. There is a large ruinedvillage of this kind near the one still occupied on the cape."On the extreme point of Cape Wankarem, and at its greatest elevation,just above the present camp of the Reindeer Chukchi, a series of threesites of old Eskimo villages were found."To this, on pages 269 et seq., Nelson adds an account of the villagesthat "died" on St. Lawrence Island during the winter of 1879-80.Capt. C. L. Hooper, in the "Cruise of the Corwin in 1881, Notes andObservations" (published in Washington, 1884, p. 100) gives the date as1878-79, and adds further details about these villages.FOOTNOTES:[51] Beechey, F.

The presentEskimo claim that it existed on the right bank, about 12 miles belowRussian Mission (Ikogmut). My visit and subsequently that of Mr. ChrisBetsch, the kind and interested trader at Russian Mission, the latterwith an old Eskimo, failed to definitely locate the site, but furtherefforts are desirable.PRESENT LOCATION OF ARCHEOLOGICAL SITESThrough personal visits, wherever possible, and through informationfrom all available sources, an effort was made to locate and learnthe character of as many of the old sites as could be traced. In thisendeavor I was aided by many whose services are hereby gratefullyacknowledged. Especial thanks are due to Captain Cochran with theofficers and men of the _Bear_, particularly Boatswain H. Berg; tothe Lomen brothers and their esteemed father, at Nome; to Father B.La Fortune and the Reverend Baldwin at Nome; to Mr. Sylvester Chance,superintendent of the northwestern district, Bureau of Education; toMr. Charles D. Brower, trader at Barrow; to Mr. Jim Allen, trader atWainwright; and to Dr. E. P. Walker, head of the Biological Survey ofAlaska. The list to follow, supplemented by maps, will give in briefthe name, location, and description of the remains.The old sites occur, (1) in the form of refuse heaps; (2) as latevillage sites, smaller or larger areas of ground covered with mostlycircular elevations and depressions, with occasionally the woodenremains of igloos or kashims, or only partly ruined dwellings; suchremains are the most common; (3) as old village sites in the form ofa long irregular ridge mound or of more or less separate heaps; (4)as heaps or "mounds" of individual structures. And as "passed" sites,covered completely by sand or silt and unknown until uncovered throughthe washing away by the sea or rivers of some of the deposits.In addition there are the remains of burial grounds which areoccasionally marked by small low mounds or hummocks produced by decayedburials that have been more or less assimilated by the tundra. Stonybeaches with chips, implements, etc., such as are found off old siteson the Yukon, have not been seen in the region now dealt with in anyinstance.The ruined dwellings and communal houses throughout this region,with a few minor exceptions, were of one general type. They werecircular, yurta-shaped, semisubterranean structures, with a more orless subterranean tunnel approach, built of hewn driftwood and earth.These dwellings, when the wood decays and the dome falls in, leavecharacteristic saucer-and-handle-like depressions. But where suchdwellings were close, and especially where they were heaped up orsuperimposed on older ones, the remains, together with the refuse, mayform an irregular elevated ridge or a large irregular mound.On the Diomede Islands the dwellings are built of stone, and ruins ofstone houses have been reported to me from inland of the westernmostparts of the Seward Peninsula. Stone dwellings were also known onNorton Sound.Some of the ridges and heaps, as at Shishmaref, Point Hope, one ofthe Punuk Islands, etc., are large and may be up to 15 feet and overin depth, but mostly the remains are of moderate to small size. Thelatter sometimes could easily be confounded with natural formations.The older remains may superficially be indistinguishable even to anexperienced observer; and if there is anything still more ancient, itlies somewhere in the old sands and beaches where, except through somefortunate accident, it can not be discovered. Except for their surface,the remains are generally frozen hard, and no excavation is possibleexcept through gradual exposure and the melting of layer after layer bythe warmth of the sun or a melting of the ground with water or by someother artificial means.Some at least of these ruins are rich archeologically. They greatlyexceed in this respect a large majority of village ruins and moundsin the interior of the continent. This appears from their gradualexcavation by the natives at Barrow, Point Hope, St. Lawrence Island,and elsewhere. The natives have now for many years been sellingthousands of articles thus obtained to traders, teachers, and crews ofvisiting vessels. A regular and growing trade detrimental to archeologyis now being carried on in "fossil ivory," which generally consists ofpieces showing human workmanship and occasionally includes specimens ofrare beauty and importance.The archeological contents of such old sites as that near Savonga onthe St. Lawrence Island, or those at Wales, Point Hope, Barrow, etc.,are varied, and in instances exceedingly interesting. They comprisea large variety of objects of stone, ivory, bone, and wood, while inthe more superficial layers are also found occasionally glass beads orobjects of metal. Some ruins, such as those at Point Hope and Kotzebue,are very rich in stone objects; others, as those at the St. LawrenceIsland, are rich in articles of ivory and bone. Pottery is generallyscarce. Articles of stone comprise mainly points, knives, adzes, andlamps; those of wood, goggles and masks; of bone, various parts ofsleds, a large assortment of snow and meat picks, and scrapers; ofivory, barbed points, harpoons, and lance heads, and a large varietyof tools, fetishes, and ceremonial objects; of clay, a few dishes andpots for culinary purposes. Traces of objects made of whalebone or evenbirch bark may also appear.The stones used were mainly slate and flint, but there may also bemet with quartz, quartzite, and especially the Kobuk "jade." Theworkmanship is as a rule good to excellent. The arrow points show anumber of interesting, not yet fully known, types, the long blade withparallel sides predominating. The stone lamps and rare dishes also needfurther study. The knives all approach the Asiatic semilunar variety.The bones and wooden objects and the pottery from this region arefairly well covered by the writings of Ray, Murdoch, Nelson, Rau,Thomas, and others; the masks need further study.The most interesting archeological specimens from the region of thewestern Eskimo, however, are some of those in "fossil ivory," the termbeing applied to walrus ivory that through long lying in the groundhas assumed more or less of a pearly yellow, variegated, sepia-brownor black color. These objects are known as yet very imperfectly. Theyare scarce at and especially north of Point Hope, and again along thewest coast south of Norton Sound. Their center of frequency comprisesseemingly the St. Lawrence Island, some parts of the Asiatic coast, theDiomedes, and parts of the Seward Peninsula. But they occur at least upto Point Hope, while west of Bering Strait they are said to appear asfar as the river Kolyma.Some of the objects in fossilized ivory show the well-known Eskimoart, with geometrical design. But besides these there occur here andthere beautiful specimens, harpoon heads, figures, needle cases, etc.,which are of the finest workmanship and which both in form and designdiffer from the prevailing Eskimo types. They are examples of highaboriginal art; and their engraved decorative lines are not geometricalbut beautifully curvilinear. (Fig. 12.) The accompanying illustrationsof specimens I succeeded in obtaining from different sources will showthe nature of this art. (Pls. 19-26.) Isolated specimens of this naturehave been secured before by Nelson, Neuman, Sverdrup, Stefánsson, andothers. Jenness in 1926 dug out a few from the old sites at Wales.There are several in the Museum of the American Indian in New York. Butthe largest and best collection of these remarkable articles is nowthat of the United States National Museum.[57][Illustration: FIGURE 12.--Conventionalized design from fossil ivoryspecimen shown in Plate 19]The large fossil ivory figure (20.3 cm. maximum length, pl. 26)collected by Mr. Carl Lomen and now in the National Museum is ofspecial interest. It comes from the Asiatic side. It is a handsomelymade piece, belonging in all probability to the high fossil ivoryculture. Its peculiarity is the bi-bevel face, a face made by twoplanes rising to a median ridge. It is so far a unique specimen of itskind. But with the aid of Mr. H. W. Krieger, curator of ethnology,United States National Museum, we found similar bi-beveled faces inwooden figures from northeast Asia, in wooden Eskimo masks from theYukon, and in wooden ceremonial figures from Panama. The latter areshown herewith. (Pl. 27.) The whole presents evidently a nice problemfor the archeologist and student of culture.[Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 19TERMINAL PIECE OF A LANCE OR HARPOON.

(Gift to the U.S.N.M. by A. H., 1926.)Right: Two old ceremonial Mexican obsidian knives.]I had further the good fortune to secure, through the kindness ofReverend Baldwin, two handsome and remarkable knives from fossilmammoth ivory. These knives were said to have been made recently by theEskimo of the Seward Peninsula. They are shown in Plate 28. They eachbear on the handle a nicely carved crouching animal figure. With themare shown, somewhat more reduced, two probably ceremonial knives fromOld Mexico; and also the handle of a late palaeolithic poignard fromFrance, illustrated by De Quatrefages.[58] Regarding the latter form weread the following in Mortillet:[59] "D'autres poignées de poignard,faites dans des données pratiques et artistiques analogues, ont étérecueillies dans diverses collections. Les plus remarquables sont deuxpoignées en ivoire trouvées par Peccadeau de l'Isle, à Bruniquel. L'unese rattachait à la lame, comme dans la pièce précédente, par le trainde derrière; l'autre, au contraire, par la tête." Knives with similarcrouching animal figures on the handle are being made by the KingIslanders.Here, evidently, is one more interesting problem for the archeologists.The art shown by these objects, the conventionalization, and especiallythe decorations, appear to show affinity on one hand to deeper easternAsia and on the other to those of the American northwest coast andeven lower. This may prove to mean much or little. The fact that thesespecimens establish beyond question is that at one time and up to afew hundreds of years ago there existed in the lands of the northernBering Sea native art superior to that existing there later and at thepresent, and comparable with the best native Siberian or American.The meaning of this fact seems to me to be of importance. The evidencesuggests, aside from other things, that American cultural developmentsmay after all not have been purely local or even American, but thatthey may, in part at least, have been initiated or carried from Asia.In view of these and other recent developments it seems rational toconsider that America may have been peopled by far eastern Asiaticgroups that not merely carried with them differences in language andphysique but also in some cases relatively high cultural developments.But these for the present are mere hypotheses.There is no definite indication as yet that the people of the highfossil ivory art in the northern Bering Sea and neighboring parts wereany others than the ancestors of the Eskimo. The skeletal remains fromthese regions, as will be shown later, rather support this view. Butthose ancestors may not yet have represented the characteristic presenttype of the people. Here, too, nothing definite can be said before theresults of sufficient scientific excavations become available.FOOTNOTES:[57] MacCurdy described the first specimen of this kind in 1921 as "AnExample of Eskimo Art," in Amer.

Paris, 1900, 206-207.SITES AND VILLAGESThe location of the western Eskimo villages has received more or lessattention by most of the explorers in their region from the Russiantime onward; but such efforts are generally limited to the livingvillages in the area visited by the observers.Perhaps the earliest Russian map of value in this connection on theBering Sea region is that which I find in Billings and Gall's Voyage or"Putěshestvie" of 1791, printed in St. Petersburg 1811. The map bearsno date, but is evidently quite early. It gives three villages on thewestern point and north coast of the Seward Peninsula, namely Kiemile(later Nykhta, now Wales), Chegliukh, and Tykiak. (Pl. 29.)The most notable and valuable of the Russian contributions to thissubject is that of Zagoskin. This refers to the period of 1842-1844 andis contained partly in his "Peshechodnaia Opis," etc. (St. Petersburg,1847), but especially on his maps. There are, I find, two of thesemaps--the "Merkatorskaia Karta Časti Sieverozapadnago Berega Ameriky"and the "Merkatorskaia Generalnaia Karta Časti Rossijskich Vladěnii vAmerikě." I came across the first in one copy of Zagoskin's invaluableaccount, which should long ago have been translated into English, andthe other in another copy. Part of the second is here reproduced.(Pl. 30.) Both bear the statement that they were made by Zagoskinas the result of his explorations on the Yukon in 1842-1844. Thesecond ("general") map is much the clearer and richer. Both maps, butespecially the second, give a good number of villages, especially aboutNorton Sound and along the southern shore of Seward Peninsula. Theorthography differs somewhat on the two charts.The Tebenkof Atlas of 1849 includes a remarkably good map of the St.Lawrence Island. As on other Russian maps it gives the Punuk Islands,that later are lost by most map makers, and indicates the location ofwhat probably were all the living settlements of that time, except onthe Punuk. (Fig. 27.)Finally, in 1861, Tikhmenief, in his "Istoričeskoie Obozrenie" (historyof Russian America) gives a detailed map with many locations of Eskimovillages.The Aleutian Islands and Kodiak are excellently dealt with byVeniaminof and also Tikhmenief, though little special attention isgiven to the location of the settlements.None of the Russian explorers, regrettably, report verbally on thedeserted sites or ruins. But their registration and location of manyvillages that have since become "dead" is of much historical as well asanthropological value.[Illustration: FIGURE 13.--World map]Of later and particularly American authors who gave attention to thelocation of the western Eskimo settlements, the foremost is E. W.Nelson. Beginning in 1877 with the St. Michael Island and ending withthe cruise of the _Corwin_ in 1881, Nelson made trips down the coastto the Kuskokwim, up the Yukon to Anvik, over the Bering Sea, the St.Lawrence Island and parts of the Chukchee Peninsula, and finally,with the _Corwin_, along the northern coasts to Point Barrow. Andthese journeys were devoted largely to biological and ethnologicalobservations and collections, the latter including the location of thewestern Eskimo habitations of that time. His locations are given on theaccompanying map (fig. 15) taken from his classic memoir, "The Eskimoabout Bering Strait," published in 1900 in the Eighteenth Annual Reportof the Bureau of American Ethnology. This memoir contains a section of"Ruins" (pp. 263-266), a brief account of the recently dead villageson St. Lawrence Island (p. 269), and an instructive section on Eskimoburials (pp. 310-322). Nelson brought also the first more substantialcollection of Eskimo crania.The next deserving man in these connections is Ivan Petrof. OfRussian-American extraction, Petrof was charged in 1880 with thecensus enumeration of the natives in Alaska, and he later published[60]a valuable report on his work, together with detailed demographic dataand a map on which are given all the living settlements of his time.Nelson's map is partly based on Petrof's data.Since Nelson and Petrof but little has been done in this field. Butthe maps of these two observers have been utilized more or less bythe map makers of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, theGeological Survey, and other Government agencies concerned with Alaska.The result is that some of these charts are exceptionally useful to theanthropological explorer in Alaska; nevertheless the data they carryare incomplete and the locations or names are not always exact, a goodmany of the villages shown are now dead, and old ruins, as usual, havereceived no attention.[Illustration: FIGURE 14.--Dall's map of the distribution of the tribesof Alaska and adjoining territory, 1875]A very valuable supplement to all the maps has in 1902 been publishedby the United States Geological Survey. It is the Geographic Dictionaryof Alaska, by Marcus Baker. This volume, besides brief but serviceablehistorical data, gives in alphabetical order nearly all the then-knownnames of localities in Alaska, including those of the Eskimo andIndian settlements; and each name is accompanied by brief but in manyinstances most helpful information. This highly deserving volume,indispensable to every student of Alaska, has for many years been outof print, but it is understood that a new revised edition is slowlybeing prepared.[Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 29BILLINGS AND GALL'S MAP OF BERING STRAIT AND NEIGHBORING LANDS, 1811][Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 30ESKIMO VILLAGES AND SITES.

Ethn., 1898)]Other useful publications in these connections are the United StatesCoast Pilots of Alaska, the various accounts of travelers, explorers,and men in collateral branches of science (geology, biology, etc.),the publications of the Alaska Division of the United States Departmentof Education, the annual reports of the Governor of Alaska, and thedecennial reports on Alaska of the United States Census.[Illustration: FIGURE 16.--Linguistic map, United States census, 1920]The object of the following notes and data is some measure ofusefulness to future anthropological and archeological workers inAlaska. They are surely incomplete and very imperfect, yet they may beof some service.Archeological and anthropological research in the highly importantwestern Eskimo region is bound to develop in a not far distant future;for this is the region through which in all probability America waspeopled. It is this region that promises to solve the problem of theantiquity of the Eskimo and may throw much light upon the origin ofthese people, and one that, as shown, above, has begun to reveal highlyinteresting old cultural conditions. And it is a region in whichdestruction of the remains by nature, but most so recently by thenatives themselves, proceeds at an alarming pace.The information on which these notes and the accompanying charts arebased has been obtained largely from the Russian and other maps, fromlocal traders, teachers, missionaries, and natives, and from a fewexplorers.[61] Only in a minority of cases was it possible to visitthe places in person; to have visited all would have been a task ofpleasure, but would have required a staunch boat of my own and at leastthree full seasons.Many of the sites to be given are now "dead" and there may be severalold sites in the vicinity of a living village. Others combine ruinswith present habitations. Still others are partly or even whollyabandoned a part of the year when the inhabitants go camping orhunting, and are partly or wholly occupied during the rest of theyear. Finally, there are some new settlements, with modern dwellingsand ways, and their number will increase, the Eskimo taking kindly tocivilization and individual property.The data to be given here are limited to the Eskimo territory insouthwestern and western Alaska, leaving out those in Siberia wheremuch is uncertain. Due to the uncertainties of the Prince William Soundregion they will begin with Kodiak Island. There are also on hand,principally due to Dr. E. P. Walker, numerous locations of old sitesand villages in the Indian parts of southern and southeastern Alaska,but these will best be reserved for another occasion.The Eskimo area will be roughly seen from the accompanying mappublished on the basis of the enumeration by the Fourteenth UnitedStates Census of 1920. A very great part of the territory allotted tothe Eskimo, as well as that of the Indian, is barren of any populationor its traces; the divisions represent the hunting grounds or groundsclaimed by each people, not an occupied territory. The data will begiven in south-to-north order.Nearly all the settlements in these regions are now, and have evidentlyalways been, on the shores of the seas and bays, as close to the wateras safety would permit. A few villages and sites occur also, however,on inland lakes and rivers. The favored locations have been an elevatedflat near the mouth of a fresh-water stream or the outlet of a lagoon,a sufficiently elevated spit projecting into the sea, or an elevatedbar between the sea and an inland lake. The essentials were an elevatedflat, a supply of fresh drinking water, and a location favorable forfishing and hunting; if there was some natural protection, so muchthe better. There were no inland settlements except on the lakes andrivers. In a few cases, as at the Kings and the Little Diomede Islands,very difficult locations were occupied only because outweighed by otheradvantages.Caves throughout the occupied region north of the Aleutian chain areabsent, and there was therefore no cave habitation.None of the settlements were very large, though a few were much largerthan others. They ranged from one or two family camps or houses tovillages of some hundreds of inhabitants. A large majority of thesettlements had from but two or three to approximately a dozen families.There were two main types of dwellings, the semisubterranean sod housesfor the winter and the skin tents for summer. In some places the twowere near each other; in others the summer dwellings were in anotherand at times fairly distant locality.The "zimniki" (in Russian) or winter houses were throughoutthe region of one general type. They were fair-sized circularsemisubterranean houses, made of driftwood and earth, and provided witha semisubterranean entrance vestibule. Their remains are characterizedeverywhere by a circular pit with a short straight trench depression,the same pot-and-handle type as found along the Yukon. Rarely for theconstruction of the houses, where driftwood did not suffice, recoursewas had to whale ribs and mandibles. The "letniki," or summer houses,were constructed on the surface of wood, sod and skins, or of whaleribs and skins, approaching on one hand the summer huts of variouscontinental tribes and on the other the "yurts" of the north Asiaticpeoples. The "kashims," or communal houses, were built, much as on theYukon, like the family dwellings, but occasionally quadrilateral andmuch larger. Smaller semisubterranean storage houses of driftwood andsod near the winter dwellings were seemingly general.Ruins of stone dwellings, without mortar, are said to exist in placeson Norton Sound and Bay and on a lagoon near the western end of theSeward Peninsula. The few houses on the Little Diomede are made ofloose unhewn stone slabs. The dwellings of the King Islanders are builton the rocky slope of the island on platforms supported by poles, allof driftwood.There is as a rule an absence of separate refuse heaps near thevillages. The refuse apparently has been dumped about and between thehouses rather than on separate piles.Dead villages abound. On consulting the older Russian records, however,it is seen that nearly all were still "living" as late as the earlyforties of the last century. Yet there are sites that were "dead"already when the Russians came, and the accumulations in other casesdenotes a long occupation.The site of a dead village, in summer, is generally marked by richerand greener vegetation; same as on the Yukon. The site itself isusually pitted or humped in a line forming a more or less elevatedridge, or the pits may be disseminated without apparently much order.And there may be irregular mound-like heaps without external traces ofany structure.In the older sites no trace of wood is visible; in the later rottenposts, crosspieces, parts of the covering of the house or tunnel, oreven a whole habitation may be present. In the old sites the wood ishewn with stone axes; in the later it is sawed, and there may be nails.Older accumulations lie occasionally beneath more recent ones, thoughno interruption of continuity may be traceable. Of a superposition ofvillages no trace was observable.FOOTNOTES:[60] Tenth Census, VIII; reprinted in Compilation of Narratives ofExplorations in Alaska. U. S. Senate Rept. 1023, Washington, 1900,55-281.[61] I am especially indebted to the two maps of Zagoskin (one preparedby himself, one from his data); to the 1849 Russian map of the St.Lawrence Island; to the various maps of the U.

Occasionally they utilized also, it seems, old dwellingsfor this purpose, and in more recent times at least the surfaceburials, wherever there was driftwood, would be protected by heavyrough-hewn planks put together in the form of boxes or by driftwood.They bear close fundamental resemblance to those of the Yukon. On theNunivak Island occur graves made of rough stone slabs piled up withoutmuch order. (Pl. 31, _a_, _b_.)Throughout the region the burials were located near the village, butthe distance varied according to local conditions and habits. In someof the Eskimo villages of the lower Yukon, as at Old Hamilton, someburials were close to the houses of the living. In the Bering andArctic regions the burial grounds, though sometimes of necessity notfar from the houses, as at the Little Diomede, in other places, as atPoint Hope and Barrow, were at a distance extending to beyond a mileand a half from the village.As a rule the wood of burials older than about 80 years was found fullydecayed with the bones secondarily buried. Of earlier burials there isgenerally no trace on the surface, but on excavation skeletal remainsare found at various depths below the surface. These characteristicself-burials, or rather tundra burials, may prove of much importanceto anthropology in the future. As outlined before (see Narrative, pp.77, 79) the process is a decay of the wood; the sagging down of thebones, covered more or less by the decayed material; an encroachment ofmoss or other vegetation on the little mound thus produced; and gradualaccumulation through wind or water carried materials of more coveringover the bones, until the mound disappears and the remains, generallystill in good condition, are buried as if intentionally inhumed.The Eskimo everywhere were found to be exceedingly sensible about theolder, and even recent, skeletal remains, and assisted readily in theircollection, as well as in excavation, offering thus the best possibleconditions for anthropological and archeological work in these regions.The notes, charts, and a detailed list of the sites and villagesfollow. In numerous cases it was found impossible to say whether a sitewas completely "dead" or still occasionally partly occupied, so thatdistinctive markings had to be abandoned.PRINCE WILLIAM SOUND, KODIAK ISLAND, ALASKA PENINSULAVery largely still a terra incognita for anthropology and archeology.Partly occupied by Indians (Prince William Sound, Kodiak Island?),partly by mix-blood Aleut (parts of Peninsula, and of Kodiak), partlyby Eskimo.

S. NationalMuseum Expedition). In these regions and on the Nunivak Island itwas possible to locate a series of villages some of which are still"living," others in ruins. In the late seventies of the last century,as stated before, the coast between Kuskokwim Bay and St. MichaelIsland was visited and its villages recorded by Nelson. A detailedarcheological survey of this coast remains for the future. DoctorRomig, formerly a medical missionary at Bethel, told me of a number ofold sites on the river. Some notes of interest by T. D. Stewart aregiven in the details. Mr. F. W. Bundy, for a time my companion on the_Bear_, told of an old site on the Kuskokwim. In March, 1927, H. W.Averill, writing from Bethel, tells of a deep-lying old site on thesouthern coast of the Kuskokwim Bay. (See details.) And later the sameyear Father Philip I.

Theregion is bleak and the Eskimo there are reported to live miserably.The principal Eskimo villages and sites along the lowermost branch ofthe Yukon have been given previously. (Fig. 11.)From the northernmost pass of the Yukon to St. Michael Island thecoast is poor in Eskimo remains. A site of interest here is the oldcamping ground, with a few permanent houses, of Pastolik, and thereare two small sites farther up the coast. Pastolik to the writer'svisit was still occasionally occupied by a few Eskimo families. Thereare only three houses, but a relatively large and old cemetery speaksof a larger population, probably camping here in tents during thesummer seasons of the past. The burial grounds were found to be ratherextensive and give indications of containing human bones as well asartifacts below the present surface (buried by the tundra). The mainpart of the burial grounds may well repay an excavation.ST. MICHAEL ISLAND.--Eskimo remains exist on the northeastern pointof the island beyond the present white man's village, and also on therock (Whale Island) opposite this point. During my visit the groundwas so overgrown by high weeds that details were hidden. On this samenortheastern point near the extension of the white settlement is asmall living Eskimo village, most of the inhabitants of which are nowof mixed blood. Across St. Michael Bay are said to be some old tracesof Eskimo, and Nelson reported an old site in the southern part ofthe island. Finally at Cape Stephens, in the western extremity of theisland, there is "Stebbins," another living village. Nothing could belearned of any human remains on the opposite Stuart Island.NORTON SOUND.--North of St. Michael Island is Norton Sound and NortonBay. Along the east coast of the Sound there are three villages stilloccupied, but with old accumulations. It is reported that in thisregion there are some ruined houses in which mammoth tusks had beenused in the construction, but nothing definite could be learned asto the location of these houses and the whole may be but a story.The village of Unalaklik was of importance in the past and its olderremains would probably repay excavation. Old sites are reported fromthe vicinity of Shaktolik and at Cape Denbigh.The Norton Bay region (fig. 22), now almost depopulated, had in 1840 awhole series of moderate-sized living Eskimo settlements, both on theeast and the west shore. These shallows are but little visited, and itis probable that the remains of the villages and some at least of theskeletal material of their burying grounds are well preserved. Theycall for early attention.To the west of Norton Bay, on the southern coast of Seward Peninsula,is Golovnin[64] Bay. On the eastern shore of this bay are now, as therewere in Russian times, two settlements, but the name of one has beenmisplaced. On Zagoskin's map it is clearly seen that the village Chingor Chinig corresponds in location to what now is the mission, whilewhat is now called "Cheenik" was in 1840 Ikalik or Ikalikhaig. Therewill soon be seen another instance of such a misapplication of theoriginal names.To the west Golovnin Bay is bounded by a large promontory ending inRocky Point. To the east of this point is a shallow bay, where I founda late Eskimo house and on the elevated shore a little to the left fourfairly recent adult burials. Farther down the bay was an Eskimo camp,without signs of anything older; but Zagoskin's map gives a settlement,probably also a camp, at this place, named Knikhtak. From this a rockypoint projects eastward into the bay. Behind this point is a shallowcove with elevated ground above the beach, and at the inland end ofthis bay I found the remains of a small old village. Traces of burialswere seen on the elevated ground but skeletal remains were absent.On the southwestern shore of the promontory that bounds Golovnin Bay onthe west the Russians (Zagoskin) recorded two villages, the one nearto Rocky Point being Chiukak, that on a point farther northwest beingnamed Chaimiut. Later the name Chiukak became applied to the formerChaimiut, while Chiukak proper was dead and forgotten. On latest maps,such as Chart 9302 United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, neither ofthe old names appears. The name Bluff denotes a small settlement inabout the location of the former Chaimiut. Some Eskimo met in GolovninBay said that there are skeletal remains near the original Chiukak, butan attempt to reach the place failed through rough water.FOOTNOTES:[64] This is the correct orthography. See Russian maps.SOUTH SHORE OF SEWARD PENINSULA WEST OF BLUFFA number of dead villages are found along this coast. The first andlargest is located a few miles west of Port Safety, 18 miles east ofNome. This was a large village extending for a considerable distancealong the elevated beach separating an inland lagoon from the sea. Thedepressions of the dwellings, of the usual dipper-with-handle type,are very plain. Old settlers at Nome remember when the village wasstill occupied. Nearer the sea the beach is said to have been linedwith burials, but the storm of 1913 took or covered everything. (SeeNarrative, p. 90.)A small Eskimo settlement existed on a rocky elevation east of CapeNome. There are some house sites, but the place gives little promiseof archeological importance. We found evidence that the site must havebeen occupied until fairly recently. Among the bowlders were found twoskeletons.A larger dead village is located near the mouth of a little stream westof Cape Nome. It is doubtless the Azachagiag of the Zagoskin generalmap. It gives no great promise archeologically.From Nome to Point Spencer there are several old sites, all "dead"; andthere are one or two recently "dead" villages on Sledge (the old Aiakor Aziak) Island. Of the coast sites, the most important is reported tobe that at Cape Woolley. It is said to have been the stopping point ofthe King Islanders and may have been their old mainland village.A number of old sites and burial grounds have been seen or learned ofin Port Clarence and Salt Lake. They are marked on the map, and thoseof the lake have been discussed in the Narrative (p. 117). Those onSalt Lake (Imuruk Basin) deserve attention.Between Port Clarence and Cape Prince of Wales only one, and thatevidently not a very large site, was learned of at Cape York.The most important site of the peninsula region is doubtless that atthe cape. Thanks to the able local teacher of that time, Mr. ClarkM. Garber, I am able to present a detailed map of this locality. Itis here that Doctor Jenness in 1926 conducted some excavations withinteresting results. But the site has barely been touched. It is thenearest point to Asia. There are ample indications that it has beenoccupied for a long period and by relatively large numbers of people.Besides the ruined parts and old heaps there are still the skulls andbones of many burials among the rocks about the village, and there isevidence that more are in the ground. It is one of the chief sitesof the far northwest for systematic thorough exploration, and suchexploration is a growing necessity for all branches of anthropologyinterested in the problems of the Bering Sea and Asiatic-Americanconnections.SCAMMON BAY, NORTON SOUND, SOUTH COAST OF SEWARD PENINSULA, TO CAPERODNEY[FIG. 22]91. _Melatolik._--A small coast village.92. _Bimiut._--A small coast village.93. _Kwikak._--Eskimo village on the outer coast in the Yukon Delta, alittle south of the mouth of Black River.

It is dangerous of approachto any except small boats. The only place that could be visited by mewas Shishmaref, a good-sized thriving Eskimo village, on both sides ofwhich along the sea are remains of old sites with burials. The moreimportant old settlement was that to the east of the village. Hereare found large and extensive heaps, the tops of which have recentlybeen leveled for fox cages, the whole site belonging, regrettably,to a newly established fox farm. It is an old site, though probablyoccupied up to white man's times, and is doubtless of some importance.Excavations would still be possible, as the bulk of the remains isintact; and though the surface skeletal material has been removed (partsaved for our collections), there are indications of surface burials(assimilations by the tundra) in the ground.Between Wales and Shishmaref are several dead sites, as shown on themap, and some of them, judging from the information obtained, are ofpromise. One of these settlements, "Tapkhaig," was evidently still aliving village at the time of Zagoskin (1840).Northeast and east of Shishmaref the coast is known even less than thatto the west. A few miles off Shishmaref I saw from a distance--the boatcould not approach nearer--what to all appearances was a large ridge ofruins, and from various maps and other sources information was obtainedof several other sites, all of which represent former villages. Fromone of these sites on the Bucknell River Mr. Carl Lomen secured a finepiece of fossil ivory carving, and the site is said to be of muchpromise. The whole coast is a virgin field for archeology.143. _Mitletukeruk._--Old village site.

Nearly all these are now "dead villages," though someEskimo may still occasionally camp in their vicinity. A large presentsettlement of the Eskimo, well advanced toward civilization, is foundat Kotzebue, and fish camps extend from here along the shore in thedirection of Cape Blossom. Another important recent living village andschool center is Noorvik on the lower Kobuk River.Inquiries as to old sites in this region were greatly assisted byMr. Sylvester Chance, at the time of my visit the supervisor of theGovernment schools of the district. At my request and with the aidof the natives Mr. Chance has compiled a list of such sites andsettlements as could still be remembered, and the information has beenincorporated into these records.Among the more important ruins of this vicinity are apparently those atand near Cape Krusenstern, and again those near Kevalina farther to thenorthward. Archeological specimens of considerable interest were seenand partly secured from both localities. The old Kevalina especiallyshould receive early attention, for it is being excavated by the Eskimoof the present village, though fortunately this is at some distance.SEWARD PENINSULA, KOTZEBUE SOUND, AND NORTHWARD158. _Kotzebue._--Old name: Kikikhtagiuk.

It is unanimously declared by the Eskimo of the coastto be one of the oldest settlements and has always been the largestnative center on the coast. The point was called Golovnin Point by theearly Russians; it was called Point Hope by Beechey in 1826 in honorof Sir William Johnston Hope. At the time of its visit by the revenuecutter _Corwin_, 1884, there are said to have been two villages;[65]the second being possibly at the site of the old whaling station.Rasmussen, who visited the village about 1924, speaks of it in partas follows:[66] "Point Hope or Tikeraq, 'the pointing finger,' isone of the most interesting Eskimo settlements on the whole coast ofAlaska, and has doubtless the largest collection of ruins. The oldvillage, now deserted, consists of 122 very large houses, but as thesea is constantly washing away parts of the land and carrying off morehouses, it is impossible to say what may have been the original number.Probably the village here and its immediate neighborhood had at onetime something like 2,000 souls, or as many as are now to be foundthroughout the whole of the Northwest Passage between the Magnetic Poleand Herschel Island."The ruins are to the northwest and west of the present village. Thoseto the northwest consist of imposing heaps, which together form anelevated ridge facing the sea. It is said that this old settlement wasabandoned because of the encroachments upon it by the sea, particularlyduring storms.The ruins of this main compound have been for several years assiduouslyexcavated inch by inch by the local Eskimo, and thousands of articlesof great variety, of stone, bone, ivory, and wood, with here and therein the uppermost layers an object of metal, are being gathered andsold to all comers. With these are found a few human skulls and bones,but especially the skulls and bones of various animals, all of whichunfortunately have hitherto been left behind in the mud. But theprobably most valuable central and lower portions of the piles remain.The locality calls loudly for proper exploration, which will well repayany museum by the quantity and value of the specimens that are sure tobe recovered.FOOTNOTES:[65] Healy, M.

The number of old sites is rather large, but itappears that there is not much of special promise until we reach nearBarrow.Old "igloos" southwest of Barrow: From 5 to 8 miles southwest ofBarrow and at some distance (up to about 400 yards) from the shorethere existed, and in part still exist, a series of elevations whichthe natives of Barrow always regarded as natural. On excavation thelarger of these elevations proved to be old structures with numerousburials and cultural objects, and the remains, as shown elsewhere, areexceptional for this coast. Six of these "mounds" have been excavatedby the University of Pennsylvania Expedition (Van Valin), whileseveral are still remaining. It is very important that these should becarefully excavated before they are attacked by the natives of Barrowfor mercenary purposes.BARROW AND POINT BARROWTwo large living villages, with old sites and inhumed (natural) burialsin their vicinity, and with some old remains between them. Barrow isthe most important present mixed settlement and center of civilizationin the Arctic. Besides the school, it contains a mission hospital andrecently a meteorological observatory and wireless station. The tundrasto the east of the village for about 1½ miles show patches of burials,particularly in the more distant parts of this region on the elevationsto both sides of a small stream.Much archeological work remains to be done about Barrow, particularlyin the remainder of the old "igloos." East of Point Barrow thepopulation is very sparse and no ruins of any note or settlementsare reported before those of the Barter Island and the mouth of theColville River.175. _Pingishuguruk._--A small old site.176. _Ketchemeluk._--A small old site.176a. _Ipnot._--Eskimo village on the Arctic coast, near Cape Thomson,a little south of Point Hope.

LAWRENCE ISLANDRanking in archeological and anthropological importance with Wales andin some respects perhaps even exceeding the latter, is the large islandof St. Lawrence, with the almost forgotten little Punuk group at itseastern extremity.[Illustration: FIGURE 26.--Russian map of St. Lawrence Island, 1849.(Tebenkof)]The main island was discovered by Bering on St. Lawrence Day, August10, 1728, and it was found peopled by the Eskimo. In 1849 an excellentmap of it was published by Tebenkof in Novo-Archangelsk, and on thismap (fig. 26) are indicated about a dozen smaller or larger Eskimosettlements, some of which, however, are not named and may already havebeen "dead."About 1878 there were still six settlements with somewhat less than1,500 Eskimo inhabitants on the island. That winter (1878-79) not lessthan 1,000 of the population died of famine (Hooper), three of thevillages becoming completely depopulated and a fourth nearly so. ThePunuk Island village may have become extinct about the same time.To-day there are on the St. Lawrence Island but two living settlements,the main one, now known as Gambell, at the old site of Chibukak on thenorthwestern cape, and the other, Savonga, about 40 miles east of it,near Cape North.A number of the old sites on this island, and also that on one of thePunuks, indicate a long occupation, antedating by far the advent of theRussians. The accumulations rise in some places to imposing heaps orridges. Their frozen contents yield quantities of fossil ivory, all ofwhich shows the work of man, and among them occur specimens with finecurvilinear designs and of high scientific as well as artistic value.Through Nelson in 1881 and R. D. Moore in 1912 the SmithsonianInstitution has acquired a large quantity of human skeletal materialfrom the main island, and there is now (1928) an expedition of theInstitution under Collins on the Punuk as well as the St. Lawrenceexploring some of the principal ruins.THE DIOMEDE ISLANDS AND THE ASIATIC COAST[FIGS. 27 AND 28]The smaller or American Diomede, though a very inhospitable place,supports, and that evidently since long, a small Eskimo villageof stone houses, below and about which there is a considerableaccumulation of refuse. Doctor Jenness dug here for a short time in1926.The larger or Russian Diomede has two villages, each of which is largerthan the one on the smaller island. There are also said to be someremains in a broad depression on the eastern side of the island, whileskeletal remains are reported by the natives to exist among the rockson the top. This island is in need of thorough attention. Its peopleare reputed to be skilled ivory workers. They come yearly to Nome,where they were visited and seen at their work by the writer. Theybring each year some fossil ivory, said to come mainly from the Asiaticcoast, and among this are occasionally articles of much interest.Ruins of Eskimo villages are also present along the coasts of theChukchee Peninsula, both those facing the Bering Sea and those alongthe Arctic. Very little is definitely known or can be found from theAmerican Eskimo about these ruins, and some of them may not be Eskimo.Nelson in his book (p. 265) reports briefly on a few about CapeWankarem. Interesting objects of the fossil ivory culture are saidto occur in these old sites as far west as the Kolyma, but nothingis certain except that there are ruins, that a good number of themare probably Eskimo, and that fossil ivory, both worked (walrus) andunworked (mammoth), comes from these coasts. A noteworthy report isthat of a large native cemetery on the Bering Sea side, with hundredsof burials in rough stone-slab graves. Information of this was given meby Joe Bernard, well known in connection with Bering Sea explorations,who had seen the site in person.[Illustration: FIGURE 27.--Eskimo villages and sites, St. LawrenceIsland, the Diomedes, and the eastern Asiatic coast]211. _Gambell_ (_or Chibukuk_).--Old Eskimo settlement on the northwestcape of St. Lawrence Island.

(See Nelson,The Eskimo of Bering Strait, p. 265.)PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGYEARLIER DATAThe previously published data on the western Eskimo are few in numberand mostly not as well documented as would be desirable. There are,however, a good number of references to the physical characteristicsof the people by explorers. The main of these are given below. Thesereferences in general are not of much scientific value, yet in someinstances they approach this closely and are of considerable interestcollectively.1784, Cook:[67]  The inlet which we had now quitted, was distinguished by Captain  Cook with the name of Prince William's Sound. * * * The natives  whom we saw were in general of a middling stature, though many of  them were under it. They were square or strong chested, with short  thick necks, and large broad visages which were for the most part  rather flat. The most disproportioned part of their body appeared  to be their heads, which were of great magnitude. Their teeth were  of a tolerable whiteness, broad, well set, and equal in size. Their  noses had full round points, turned up at the tip; and their eyes,  though not small, were scarcely proportioned to the largeness of  their faces. They had black hair which was strong, straight, and  thick. Their beards were in general thin or deficient, but the  hairs growing about the lips, of those who have them, were bristly  or stiff and often of a brownish color; and some of the elderly men  had large, thick straight beards. * * * The complexion of some of  the females, and of the children, is white without any mixture of  red. Many of the men, whom we saw naked, had rather a swarthy cast,  which was scarcely the effect of any stain, as it is not their  custom to paint their bodies.  Vol. 3, page 31: All the Americans we had seen since our arrival on  that coast (west coast of Alaska) had round, chubby faces, and high  cheek bones, and were rather low of stature.  Ibid., page 72: _Norton Sound._--The woman was short and squat and  her visage was plump and round. * * * Her husband was well made and  about 5 feet 2 inches in height. His hair was black and short, and  he had but little beard. His complexion was of a light copper cast.  * * * The teeth of both of them were black, and appeared as if they  had been filed down level with the gums.1821, Kotzebue:[68]  _Kotzebue Sound._--The Americans [i. e., Eskimo] are of a middle  size, robust make, and healthy appearance; their countenances * * *  are characterized by small eyes and very high cheek bones.1832, Beechey:[69]  The western Esquimaux appear to be intimately connected with the  tribes inhabiting the northern and northeastern shores of America,  in language, features, manners, and customs. They at the same time,  in many respects, resemble the Tschutschi, from whom they are  probably descended. * * *  They are taller in stature than the eastern Esquimaux, their  average height being about 5 feet 7½ inches. They are also a better  looking race, if I may judge from the natives I saw in Baffin's  Bay, and from the portraits of others that have been published. At  a comparatively early age, however, they (the women in particular)  soon lose this comeliness, and old age is attended with a haggard  and careworn countenance, rendered more unbecoming by sore eyes  and by teeth worn to the gums by frequent mastication of hard  substances.1850, Latham:[70]  Physically the Eskimo is a Mongol and Asiatic.  The Eskimos of the Atlantic are not only easily distinguished from  the tribes of American aborigines which lie to the south or west  of them, and with which they come in contact, but they stand in  strong contrast and opposition to them--a contrast and opposition  exhibited equally in appearance, manners, language, and one which  has had full justice done to it by those who have written on the  subject.  It is not so with the Eskimos of Russian-America, and the parts  that look upon the Pacific. These are so far from being separated  by any broad and trenchant line of demarcation from the proper  Indians or the so-called red race, that they pass gradually  into it, and that in respect to their habits, manner, and  appearance, equally. So far is this the case that he would be a  bold man who should venture, in speaking of the southern tribes  of Russian-America, to say here the Eskimo area ends and here a  different area begins.1853, Hooper:[71]  _Kotzebue Sound Esquimeaux._--The men generally were taller than  the average of Europeans, strongly built and well formed; some  had well-marked features * * *. The women, were generally short,  the visages of the younger ones tolerably good but * * * the  very reverse was the case with the dames of more advanced age.  Their figures inclined to the squat, their mien and expression  promised intelligence and good nature. Although both sexes had in  most instances the round flat face of the Mongolian cast, a few  individuals possessed well-defined, though petite features, and all  had fine eyes.[Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 31GRAVES AT NASH HARBOR, NUNIVAK ISLAND(Photos by Collins and Stewart, 1927.)][Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 32SCHOOL CHILDREN AT WALES][Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 33_a_, Children, Nunivak Island.

U.S.N.M.)]1853, Seemann, vol. II, pages 49-51:[72]  _The Eskimos._--By comparing the accounts transmitted by different  writers we find that the various tribes, however widely separated  geographically, differ but slightly from each other in appearance,  manners, customs, or language. They are, however, by no means as  uniform in size as might have been expected. Those inhabiting the  vicinity of Norton and Kotzebue Sounds are by far the finest and  tallest, while those living between Cape Lisburne and Point Barrow  are, like the tribes of the eastern portions of America, much  shorter in stature, and bespeak the inferiority of the districts in  which they live.  Both sexes are well proportioned, stout, muscular, and active.  The hands and feet are small and beautifully formed, which is  ascribed by some writers to their sedentary habits, but this  cannot be the case, as probably no people take more exercise or  are more constantly employed. Their height varies. In the southern  parts some of the men are 6 feet; in the more northern there is a  perceptible diminution, though by no means to the extent generally  imagined.  Their faces are flat, their cheek bones projecting, and their eyes  small, deeply set, and, like the eyebrows, black. Their noses  are broad; their ears are large, and generally lengthened by the  appendage of weighty ornaments; their mouths are well formed, their  lips are thin. * * *  The teeth of the Eskimos are regular, but from the nature of  their food and from their practice of preparing hides by chewing,  are worn down almost to the gums at an early age. Their hair is  straight, black, and coarse; the men have it closely cut on the  crown, like that of a Capuchin friar, leaving a band about two  inches broad, which gradually increases in length towards the back  of the neck; the women merely part their hair in the middle, and,  if wealthy, ornament it with strings of beads. The possession of a  beard is very rare, but a slight moustache is not infrequent. Their  complexion, if divested of its usual covering of dirt, can hardly  be called dark; on the contrary, it displays a healthy, rosy tint,  and were it not for the custom of tattooing the chin some of the  girls might be called pretty, even in the European acceptation of  the term.1861, Richardson:[73]  The Eskimos are remarkably uniform in physical appearance  throughout their far-stretching area, there being perhaps no other  nation in the world so unmixed in blood. Frobisher's people were  struck with their resemblance in features and general aspect to the  Samoyeds and their physiognomy has been held by all ethnologists  to be of the Mongolian or Tartar type. Doctor Latham calls the  Samoyeds Hyperborean Mongolidae, and the Eskimos he ranges among  the American Mongolidae, embracing in the latter group all the  native races of the New World. The Mongol type of countenance is,  however, more strongly reproduced in the Eskimos than in the red  Indians--the conterminous Tinné tribes differing greatly in their  features, and the more remote Indians still more.  Generally the Eskimos have broadly egg-shaped faces with  considerable prominence of the rounded cheeks caused by the arching  of the cheek bones, but few or no angular projections even in the  old people, whose features are always much weather beaten and  furrowed. The greatest breadth of the face is just below the eyes,  the forehead tapers upward, ending narrowly, but not acutely, and  in like manner the chin is a blunt cone; both the forehead and the  chin recede, the egg outline showing in profile, though not so  strongly, as in a front view. The nose is broad and depressed, but  not in all, some individuals having prominent noses, yet almost all  have wider nostrils than Europeans. The eyes have small and oblique  apertures like the Chinese, and from frequent attacks of ophthalmia  and the effect of lamp smoke in their winter habitations adults of  both sexes are disfigured by excoriated or ulcerated eyelids. The  sight of these people is, from its constant exercise, extremely  keen, and the habit of bringing the eyelids nearly together when  looking at distant objects has in all the grown males produced a  striking cluster of furrows radiating from the outer corners of  each eye over the temples.  The complexions of the Eskimos when relieved from smoke and dirt  are nearly white and show little of the copper color of the red  Indians. Infants have a good deal of red on the cheeks, and when  by chance their faces are tolerably clean are much like European  children, the national peculiarities of countenance being slighter  at an early age. Many of the young women appear even pretty from  the liveliness and good nature that beams in their countenances.  The old women are frightfully ugly * * *.  The young men have little beard, but some of the old ones have a  tolerable show of long gray hairs on the upper lip and chin. * * *  The Eskimo beard, however, is in no instance so dense as a European  one.  The hair of the head is black and coarse, the lips thickish, and  the teeth of the young people white and regular, but the sand that,  through want of cleanliness, mixes with their food, wears the teeth  down at an early age almost to the level of the gums, so that the  incisors often have broad crowns like the molars.  The average stature of the Eskimos is below the English standard,  but they can not be said to be a dwarfish race. The men vary in  height from about 5 feet to 5 feet 10 inches or even more. They  are a broad-shouldered race, and when seated in their kayaks look  tall and muscular, but when standing lose their apparent height by  a seemingly disproportionate shortness of the lower extremities.  This want of symmetry may arise from the dress, as the proportions  of various parts of the body have not been tested by accurate  measurements. The hands and feet are delicately small and well  formed. Mr. Simpson (Blue Book, 1855) observed an undue shortness  of the thumb in the western Eskimos, which, if it exists farther to  the east, was not noted by the members of the searching expeditions.1870, Dall:[74]  Page 136: The Innuit, as they call themselves, belong to the same  family as the northern and western Eskimo. I have frequently  used the term Eskimo in referring to them, but they are in many  respects very different people. * * * It should be thoroughly and  definitely understood that they are not Indians nor have they any  known relation, physically * * * to the Indian tribes of North  America. Their grammar, appearance, habits, and even their anatomy,  especially in the form of the skull, separate them widely from the  Indian race. On the other hand, it is almost equally questionable  whether they are even distinctly [distantly?] related to the  Chukchees and other probably Mongolian races, of the eastern part  of Siberia.  The Innuit of Norton Sound and the vicinity are of three tribes,  each of which, while migrating at certain seasons, has its own  peculiar territory. The peninsula between Kotzebue and Norton  Sounds is inhabited by the Kaviaks or Kaviagemut Innuit. The neck  of this peninsula is occupied by the Mahlemut Innuit. The shore  of Norton Sound south of Cape Denbigh to Pastolik is the country  of the Unaleets or Unaligmut Innuit. The habits of these tribes  are essentially similar. They are in every respect superior to any  tribe of Indians with which I am acquainted.  Their complexion I have described as brunet. The effect of the  sun and wind, especially in summer, is to darken their hue, and  from observing those who lived in the fort, I am inclined to think  that a regular course of bathing would do much toward whitening  them. They are sometimes very tall; I have often seen both men and  women nearly 6 feet in height and have known several instances  where men were taller. Their average height equals that of most  civilized races. Their strength is often very great. I have seen a  Mahlemut take a 100-pound sack of flour under each arm and another  in his teeth and walk with them from the storehouse to the boat, a  distance of some 20 rods, without inconvenience.  Page 140: The women * * * are often of pleasing appearance,  sometimes quite pretty. They preserve their beauty much longer  than Indian women. Their clear complexion and high color, with  their good humor, make them agreeable companions, and they are  often very intelligent. A noticeable feature is their teeth. These  are always sound and white, but are almost cylindrical, and in  old people are worn down even with the gums, producing a singular  appearance. The eyes are not oblique as in the Mongolian races, but  are small, black, and almost even with the face. The nose is flat  and disproportionately small. Many of the Innuit have heavy beards  and mustaches, while some pull out the former.  Page 17: I * * * made the acquaintance of a fine-looking young  Mahlemut who * * * introduced me to his wife and child, the latter  about 2 years old. The former was not particularly ugly or pretty.  * * * The husband was a fine-looking, athletic fellow, standing  about 5 feet 5 inches, with a clear brunet complexion, fine color,  dark eyes, and finely arched eyebrows. The flat nose, common to  all the Eskimo tribes, was not very strongly marked in him, and a  pleasant smile, displaying two rows of very white teeth, conquered  any objection I might have felt to his large mouth. The baby looked  like any other baby. * * *  Page 376: It has been frequently remarked that the Tuski and  Innuit tribes have a Mongolian cast of countenance. This, upon an  actual comparison, will be found to be much less than is usually  supposed. The real points of resemblance are principally in the  complexion, which is somewhat similar, and in the eyes. But the  eyes of the Innuit are not oblique, as in the Chinese. They have  an apparent obliquity, which is due to the peculiar form of the  zygomatic arch, but the eyes themselves are perfectly horizontal.  The prominent characteristics of the Orarian[75] skull are the  strongly developed coronary ridge, the obliquity of the zygoma, and  its greater capacity compared with the Indian cranium. The former  is essentially pyramidal, while the latter more nearly approaches a  cubic shape.  The mean capacity (in cubic centimeters) of three Tuski skulls  from Plover Bay, according to Doctor Wyman, was 1,505; that of  20 crania of northern Eskimo, according to Doctor Davis, was  1,475, and that of 4 Innuit crania of Norton Sound was 1,320; thus  showing a wide variation. The mean capacity of 20 West American  Indian crania was only 1,284.06. The mean height of all the Orarian  skulls above referred to was 136.55 millimeters, against a breadth  of 134.47 millimeters, while the height of the Indian skulls was  120.14 millimeters, against a breadth of 100.025 millimeters. The  zygomatic diameter of the Orarian crania was 134.92 millimeters,  while that of 12 Indian skulls was 134.65 millimeters. The  Orarian skulls were most dolichocephalic, and the Indian most  brachycephalic. The latter averaged 378.71 cubic centimeters less  capacity than the former. The average height of the Orarians,  except among the stunted tribes of the extreme north, will average  as great as that of their Indian neighbors. The strength and  activity of the former far exceed that of any northern Indians with  whom I am acquainted.  Page 401: The Kaniagmuts are of middle stature and a complexion  more reddish than that of the Aleutians or more northern Innuit.  They are stoutly built, with large broad faces, and their hair is  coarse, black, and straight.  Page 407: The Magemuts * * * are tall, finely formed, and have very  fair complexions. Blue eyes are not unknown among them, but their  hair is black and their beards are very light.  The Ekogmuts. * * * A noticeable feature in many of them is the  extreme hairiness of their persons. Many have very strong black  beards and hairy bodies.  Page 410: The Point Barrow tribe are said by Richardson to be  called Nuwungmëun. * * * These northern Innuit are very few in  number. * * * Simpson mentions that their thumbs appeared to be  disproportionately short. The same may be true of the Norton Sound  Innuit; at all events, no white man can wear one of their mittens  comfortably until the thumb is lengthened.Doctor Otis, of the United States Army Medical Museum, says thatthe skulls found in the northern mounds have the same peculiaritieswhich distinguish all Orarian crania, and that both are instantlydistinguishable from any Indian skulls.1874, Bancroft (compilation):[76]  "The physical characteristics of the Eskimos are: A fair  complexion,[77] the skin, when free from dirt and paint, being  almost white; a medium stature, well proportioned, thickset,  muscular, robust, active,[78] with small and beautifully shaped  hands and feet;[79] a pyramidal head;[80] a broad egg-shaped face;  high rounded cheek bones; flat nose; small oblique eyes; large  mouth; teeth regular, but well worn;[81] coarse black hair closely  cut upon the crown, leaving a monk-like ring around the edge,[82]  and a paucity of beard."[83]Simpson, 1875:[84]  These people are by no means the dwarfish race they were formerly  supposed to be. In stature they are not inferior to many other  races and are robust, muscular, and active, inclining rather to  spareness than corpulence. The tallest individual was found to be 5  feet 10½ inches, and the shortest 5 feet 1 inch. The heaviest man  weighed 195 pounds, and the lightest 125 pounds. The individuals  weighed and measured were taken indiscriminately as they visited  the ship, and were all supposed to have attained their full  stature. Their chief muscular strength is in the back, which is  best displayed in their games of wrestling. The shoulders are  square, or rather raised, making the neck appear shorter than it  really is, and the chest is deep; but in strength of arm they can  not compete with our sailors. The hand is small, short, broad,  and rather thick, and the thumb appears short, giving an air of  clumsiness in handling anything; and the power of grasping is not  great. The lower limbs are in good proportion to the body, and  the feet, like the hands, are short and broad with a high instep.  Considering their frequent occupations as hunters, they do not  excel in speed nor in jumping over a height or a level space,  but they display great agility in leaping to kick with both feet  together an object hanging as high as the chin, or even above the  head. In walking, their tread is firm and elastic, the step short  and quick; and the toes being turned outward and the knee at each  advance inclining in the same direction, give a certain peculiarity  to their gait difficult to describe.  The hair is sooty black, without gloss, and coarse, cut in an  even line across the forehead, but allowed to grow long at the  back of the head and about the ears, whilst the crown is cropped  close or shaven. The color of the skin is a light yellowish brown,  but variable in shade, and in a few instances was observed to be  very dark. In the young, the complexion is comparatively fair,  presenting a remarkably healthy sunburnt appearance, through which  the rosy hue of the cheeks is visible; before middle life, however,  this, from exposure, gives place to a weather-beaten appearance, so  that it is difficult to guess their ages.  The face is flat, broad, rounded, and commonly plump, the cheek  bones high, the forehead low, but broad across the eyebrows,  and narrowing upwards; the whole head becomes somewhat pointed  toward the crown. The nose is short and flat, giving an appearance  of considerable space between the eyes. The eyes are brown, of  different shades, usually dark, seldom if ever altogether black,  and generally have a soft expression; some have a peculiar glitter,  which we call gipsy-like. They slope slightly upwards from the  nose, and have a fold of skin stretching across the inner angle to  the upper eyelid, most perceptible in childhood, which gives to  some individuals a cast of countenance almost perfectly Chinese.  The eyelids seem tumid, opening to only a moderate extent, and the  slightly arched eyebrows scarcely project beyond them. The ears are  by no means large, but frequently stand out sideways. The mouth  is prominent and large, and the lips, especially the lower one,  rather thick and protruding. The jawbones are strong, supporting  remarkably firm and commonly regular teeth. In the youthful  these are in general white, but toward middle age they have lost  their enamel and become black or are worn down to the gums. The  incisors of the lower jaw do not pass behind those of the upper,  but meet edge to edge, so that by the time an individual arrives  at maturity, the opposing surfaces of the eye and front teeth are  perfectly flat, independently of the wear they are subjected to  in every possible way to assist the hands. The expression of the  countenance is one of habitual good humor in the great majority of  both sexes, but is a good deal marred in the men by wearing heavy  lip ornaments. * * *  While young the women are generally well formed and good looking,  having good eyes and teeth. To a few, who besides possessed  something of the Circassian cast of features, was attributed a  certain degree of brunette beauty. Their hands and feet are small,  and the former delicate in the young, but soon become rough and  coarse when the household cares devolve upon them. Their movements  are awkward and ungainly, and though capable of making long  journeys on foot, it is almost painful to see many of them walk.  Unlike the men, they shuffle along commonly a little sideways, with  the toes turned inwards, stooping slightly forward as if carrying  a burden, and their general appearance is not enhanced by the  coat being made large enough to accommodate a child on the back,  whilst the tight-fitting nether garment only serves to display the  deformity of their bow legs. * * *  The physical constitution of both sexes is strong, and they bear  exposure during the coldest weather for many hours together without  appearing inconvenienced, further than occasional frostbites on  the cheeks. They also show great endurance of fatigue during their  journeys in the summer, particularly that part in which they  require to drag the family boat, laden with their summer tent and  all their moveables, on a sledge over the ice.  Extreme longevity is probably not unknown among them; but as they  take no heed to number the years as they pass, they can form  no guess of their own ages, invariably stating "they have many  years." Judging altogether from appearance, a man whom we saw in  the neighborhood of Kotzebue Sound could not be less than 80 years  of age. He had long been confined to his bed and appeared quite  in his dotage. There was another at Point Barrow, whose wrinkled  face, silvery hair, toothless gums, and shrunk limbs indicated an  age nothing short of 75. This man died in the month of April, 1853,  and had paid a visit to the ship only a few days before, when his  intellect seemed unimpaired, and his vision wonderfully acute for  his time of life. There is another still alive, who is said to be a  few years older.1877, Dall:[85]  Page 9: The Orarians are distinguished * * * by a light fresh  yellow complexion, fine color, broad build, scaphocephalic head,  great cranial capacity, and obliquity of the arch of the zygoma.  Page 17: The Ekogmut inhabit the Yukon delta from about Kipniuk to  Pastolik * * *. Their most noticeable personal peculiarity consists  in their hairy bodies and strong beards.1884, Hooper:[86]  About 3,000 Innuits inhabit the northwest coast of America, from  the Colville River, on the east, to Bering Strait, including  the islands therein, on the west. Many of these came under my  observation while cruising in the Arctic Ocean in command of the  _Corwin_.  In appearance they are tall and muscular, many being 6 feet in  height, and some were seen that would exceed that even. Their  peculiar dress gives them a squat appearance, and their stature  seems less than it is in reality. The women are much shorter than  the men, but both sexes are strong and active, though not equal  in these respects to the Tchuktchis and other reindeer tribes of  Siberia.  The face of the Innuit is broad below the eyes, the forehead is  narrow and receding, the chin and lower jaw broad and heavy. The  nose is usually broad and flattened, but not always; occasionally  one is seen whose features are well formed and handsome. In the  young children this is the almost invariable rule; many of them  are really beautiful. The eyes are small and black, and appear to  be slightly oblique, and for this reason, perhaps more than any  other, they have been classed with the Mongolidae. They have large  mouths, thick, loosely hanging lips, and fine, strong teeth. These,  however, from eating raw food, are usually very much worn. The  labrets worn in the lips are hideous-looking things, made of bone,  glass, stone, ivory, or in fact anything within the reach of the  native which can be worked into the requisite shape.  They have rather light skin, very different from the Indians of the  plains; and in this also they differ from the Tchuktchis, being  much lighter, and when cleansed from the dirt which usually covers  them, and freed from the sunburn and tan due to long exposure, they  become quite fair. They have small, well-formed hands and feet,  much smaller in proportion than white men. This was particularly  noticeable when buying boots and mittens from them for our use;  only the largest sizes made by them could be used at all. They are  generally without beard, but as the men grow old, they sometimes  have a thin, straggling mustache and beard, but it is never full  and regular. The hair is coarse and black.1885, Ray:[87]  Pages 37-38: The following table will show that physically the  Inyu of North American coast does not conform to the typical idea  of the Eskimo. They are robust, healthy people, fairer than the  North American Indian, with brown eyes and straight black hair.  The men are beardless until they attain the age of from 20 to 25  years, and even then it is very light and scattering, and is always  clipped close in the winter; at this season they also cut off  their eyebrows and tonsure their crown like a priest, with bangs  over their forehead. Their hands and feet are extremely small and  symmetrical; they are graceful in their movements when unincumbered  by heavy clothing.  Page 46: Physically both sexes are very strong and possess great  powers of endurance.1888, Murdoch:[88]  In stature these people are of a medium height, robust, and  muscular, inclining rather to spareness than corpulence, though  the fullness of the face and the thick fur clothing often gives  the impression of the latter. There is, however, considerable  individual variation among them in this respect. The women are  as a rule shorter than the men, occasionally almost dwarfish,  though some women are taller than many of the men. The tallest  man observed measured 5 feet 9½ inches and the shortest 4 feet 11  inches. The tallest woman was 5 feet 3 inches in height and the  shortest 4 feet ½ inch. The heaviest man weighed 204 pounds and the  lightest 126 pounds. One woman weighed 192 pounds and the shortest  woman was also the lightest, weighing only 100 pounds. The hands  and feet are small and well shaped, though the former soon become  distorted and roughened by work. We did not observe the peculiar  breadth of hands noticed by Doctor Simpson, nor is the shortness of  the thumb which he mentions sufficient to attract attention. Their  feet are so small that only one of our party, who is much below  the ordinary size, was able to wear the boots made by the natives  for themselves. Small and delicate hands and feet appear to be a  universal characteristic of the Eskimo race and have been mentioned  by most observers from Greenland to Alaska.  The face is broad, flat, and round, with high cheek bones and  rather low forehead, broad across the brow and narrowing above,  while the head is somewhat pointed toward the crown. The peculiar  shape of the head is somewhat masked by the way of wearing the hair  and is best seen in the skull. The nose is short, with little or  no bridge--few Eskimo were able to wear our spring eyeglasses--and  broad, especially across the alæ nasæ, with a peculiar, rounded,  somewhat bulbous tip, and large nostrils. The eyes are horizontal,  with rather full lids and are but slightly sunken below the level  of the face.  The mouth is large and the lips full, especially the under  one. The teeth are naturally large, and in youth are white and  generally regular, but by middle age they are generally worn down  to flat-crowned stumps, as is usual among the Eskimo. The color of  the skin is a light yellowish brown, with often considerable ruddy  color on the cheeks and lips. There appears to be much natural  variation in the complexion, some women being nearly as fair as  Europeans, while other individuals seem to have naturally a coppery  color. In most cases the complexion appears darker than it really  is from the effects of exposure to the weather. All sunburn very  easily, especially in the spring, when there is a strong reflection  from the snow.  The old are much wrinkled, and they frequently suffer from  watery eyes, with large sacks under them, which begin to form at  a comparatively early age. There is considerable variation in  features, as well as complexion, among them, even in cases where  there seems to be no suspicion of mixed blood. There were several  men among them with decided aquiline noses and something of a  Hebrew cast of countenance. The eyes are of various shades of  dark brown--two pairs of light hazel eyes were observed--and are  often handsome. The hair is black, perfectly straight, and very  thick. With the men it is generally coarser than with the women,  who sometimes have very long and silky hair, though it generally  does not reach much below the shoulders. The eyebrows are thin and  the beard scanty, growing mostly upon the upper lip and chin and  seldom appearing under the age of 20. In this they resemble most  Eskimo. Back, however, speaks of the "luxuriant beards and flowing  mustaches" of the Eskimo of the Great Fish River. Some of the older  men have rather heavy black mustaches, but there is much variation  in this respect. The upper part of the body, as much as is commonly  exposed in the house, is remarkably free from hair. The general  expression is good humored and attractive.  The males, even when very young, are remarkable for their graceful  and dignified carriage. The body is held erect, with the shoulders  square and chest well thrown out, the knees straight, and the  feet firmly planted on the ground. In walking they move with long  swinging elastic strides, the toes well turned out and the arms  swinging. * * *  I should say that they walked like well-built athletic white men.  The women, on the other hand, although possessing good physiques,  are singularly ungraceful in their movements. They walk at a sort  of shuffling half trot, with the toes turned in, the body leaning  forward, and the arms hanging awkwardly.  A noticeable thing about the women is the remarkable flexibility of  the body and limbs and the great length of time they can stand in a  stooping posture. * * * Both men and women have a very fair share  of muscular strength. Some of the women especially showed a power  of carrying heavy loads superior to most white men. We were able to  make no other comparisons of their strength with ours. Their power  of endurance is very great, and both sexes are capable of making  long distances on foot. Two men sometimes spend 24 hours tramping  through the rough ice in search of seals, and we knew of instances  where small parties made journeys of 50 or 75 miles on foot without  stopping to sleep.  The women are not prolific. Although all the adults are or have  been married, many of them are childless, and few have more than  two children. One woman was known to have at least four, but  investigations of this sort were rendered extremely difficult by  the universal custom of adoption. Doctor Simpson heard of a "rare  case" where one woman had borne seven children. We heard of no  twins at either village, though we obtained the Eskimo word for  twins.1890, Murdoch:[89]  The people who live on the extreme northwest corner of our  continent are far from being an ugly or an ill-made race. Though  they are not tall--a man of 5 feet 10 inches is a tall man among  them--they are well proportioned, broad shouldered, and deep  chested. The men, as a rule, are particularly well "set up," like  well-drilled soldiers and walk and stand with a great deal of grace  and dignity.  The women do not have such good figures, but are inclined to  slouchiness. They are seldom inclined to be fleshy, though their  plump, round faces, along with their thick fur clothing, often  give them the appearance of being fat. They generally have round,  full faces, with rather high cheek bones, small, rounded noses,  full lips, and small chins. Still, you now and then see a person  with an oval face and aquiline nose. Many of the men are very good  looking, and some of the young women are exceedingly pretty. Their  complexion is a dark brunet, often with a good deal of bright color  on the cheeks and especially on the lips. They sunburn very much,  especially in the spring, when the glare of the sun is reflected  from the snow. They have black or dark-brown eyes and abundant  black hair. The women's hair is often long and silky. When they are  young they have white and regular teeth, but these are worn down to  stumps before middle life is reached. Cheerful and merry faces are  the rule.1890, Kelly:[90]  _Personal appearance._--There are three types observable among the  Arctic Eskimos of Alaska. The tall, cadaverous natives of Kangoot,  Seelawik, Koovuk, and Kikiktowruk, on Kotzebue Sound, who live on  fish, ptarmigans, and marmots. They always have a hungry look and  habitually wear a grin of fiendish glee at having circumvented an  adverse fate. There is a tendency among these people to migrate  north.  Then there is the tall, strongly knit type of the Nooatoks, a  gigantic race, of a splendid physique that would be remarkable in  any part of the world.  Rugged as the mountains among which they live, vigorous and  courageous, they stop at nothing but the impossible to accomplish  a desired end. Their food supply is the reindeer, mountain sheep,  ptarmigans, and fish. There are many of the coast natives of this  type, but they lack the healthy glow and the indomitable will of  the Nooatoks.  The third type is the short, stumpy one, probably that of the old  Eskimo before the admixture with southern tribes, now found on the  Arctic coast. * * *  The Eskimos have coarse, black hair, some with a tinge of brown.  Many of the coast people of both sexes are bald from scrofulous  eruptions. Males have the crown of the head closely cropped, so  that reindeer may not see the waving locks when the hunter creeps  behind bunch grass. They have black eyes and high cheek bones. The  bones of the face are better protected from the severity of the  climate by a thicker covering of flesh than southern races.  Among the coast people the nose is broad and flat, with very little  or no ridge between the eyes. The adult males have short mustaches,  and some of the elder ones--more noticeable in the interior--have  rough, scraggy beards. Generally their beard is very scant, and  most of them devote otherwise idle hours to pulling out the hairs.1900, Nelson:[91]  The Eskimo from Bering Strait to the lower Yukon are fairly  well-built people, averaging among the men about 5 feet 2 or 3  inches in height. The Yukon Eskimo and those living southward  from that river to the Kuskokwim are, as a rule, shorter and more  squarely built. The Kuskokwim people are darker of complexion than  those to the northward, and have rounder features. The men commonly  have a considerable growth of hair on their faces, becoming at  times a thin beard 2 or 3 inches in length, with a well-developed  mustache. No such development of beard was seen elsewhere in the  territory visited.  The people in the coast region between the mouths of the Kuskokwim  and the Yukon have peculiarly high cheek bones and sharp chins,  which unite to give their faces a curiously pointed, triangular  appearance. At the village of Kaialigamut I was impressed by the  strong development of the superciliary ridge. From a point almost  directly over the pupil of the eye and extending thence inward to  the median line of the forehead is a strong bony ridge causing the  brow to stand out sharply. From the outer edge of this the skull  appears as though beveled away to the ears, giving the temporal  area a considerable enlargement beyond that usually shown. This  curious development of the skull is rendered still more striking by  the fact that the bridge of the nose is low, as usual among these  people, so that the shelf-like projection of the brow stands out in  strong relief. It is most strongly marked among the men and appears  to be characteristic at this place. Elsewhere in this district it  was noted only rarely here and there.  All of the people in the district about Capes Vancouver and  Romanzof, and thence to the Yukon mouth, are of unusually light  complexion. Some of the women have a pale, slightly yellowish  color, with pink cheeks, differing but little in complexion from  that of a sallow woman of Caucasian blood. This light complexion is  so exceptionally striking that wherever they travel these people  are readily distinguished from other Eskimo, and before I visited  their territory I had learned to know them by their complexion  whenever they came to St. Michael.  The people of the district just mentioned are all very short and  squarely built. Inland from Cape Vancouver lies the flat marshy  country about Big Lake, which is situated between the Kuskokwim  and the Yukon. It is a well-populated district and its inhabitants  differ from those near the coast at the capes referred to, in being  taller, more slender, and having more squarely cut features. They  also differ strikingly from any other Eskimo with whom I came in  contact, except those on Kowak River, in having the bridge of the  nose well developed and at times sufficiently prominent to suggest  the aquiline nose of our southern Indian tribes.  The Eskimo of the Diomede Islands in Bering Strait, as well as  those of East Cape and Mechigme and Plover Bays on the Siberian  coast, and of St. Lawrence Island are tall, strongly built people  and are generally similar in their physical features. These are  characterized by the unusual heaviness of the lower part of the  face due to the very square and massive lower jaw, which, combined  with broad, high cheek bones and flattened nose, produces a wide,  flat face. These features are frequently accompanied with a low  retreating forehead, producing a decidedly repulsive physiognomy.  The bridge of the nose is so low and the cheek bones so heavy that  a profile view will frequently show only the tip of the person's  nose, the eyes and upper portion of the nose being completely  hidden by the prominent outline of the cheek. Their eyes are less  oblique than is common among the people living southward from  the Yukon mouth. Among the people at the northwestern end of St.  Lawrence Island there is a greater range of physiognomy than was  noted at any other of the Asiatic localities.  The Point Hope people on the American coast have heavy jaws and  well-developed superciliary ridges. At Point Barrow the men are  remarkable for the irregularity of their features, amounting to  a positive degree of ugliness, which is increased and rendered  specially prominent by the expression produced by the short,  tightly drawn upper lip, the projecting lower lip, and the small  beady eyes. The women and children of this place are in curious  contrast, having rather pleasant features of the usual type.  The Eskimo from Upper Kowak and Noatak Rivers who were met at  the summer camp on Hotham Inlet are notable for the fact that a  considerable number of them have hook noses and nearly all have a  cast of countenance very similar to that of the Yukon Tienné. They  are a larger and more robustly built people than these Indians,  however, and speak the Eskimo language. They wear labrets, practice  the tonsure, and claim to be Eskimo. * * * Among them was seen one  man having a mop of coarse curly hair, almost negroid in character.  The same feature was observed in a number of men and women on the  Siberian coast between East Cape and Plover Bay. This latter is  undoubtedly the result of the Chukchi-Eskimo mixture, and in the  case of the man seen at Hotham Inlet the same result had been  brought about by the Eskimo-Indian combination. Among the Eskimo  south of Bering Strait on the American coast not a single instance  of this kind was observed. The age of the individuals having  this curly hair renders it quite improbable that it came from an  admixture of blood with foreign voyagers, since some of them must  have been born at a time when vessels were extremely rare along  these shores. As a further argument against this curly hair having  come from white men, I may add that I saw no trace of it among a  number of people having partly Caucasian blood. As a general thing,  the Eskimo of the region described, have small hands and feet and  the features are oval in outline, rather flat and with slightly  oblique eyes.  Children and young girls have round faces and often are  very pleasant and attractive in feature, the angular race  characteristics becoming prominent after the individuals approach  manhood. The women age rapidly, and only a very small proportion of  the people live to an advanced age.  The Malemut and the people of Kaviak Peninsula, including those of  the islands in Bering Strait are tall, active, and remarkably well  built. Among them it is common to see men from 5 feet 10 inches to  6 feet tall and of proportionate build. I should judge the average  among them to be nearly or quite equal in height to the whites.  Among the coast Eskimos, as a rule, the legs are short and poorly  developed, while the body is long with disproportionately developed  dorsal and lumbar muscles, due to so much of their life being  passed in the kaiak.  The Eskimo of the Big Lake district, south of the Yukon, and from  the Kaviak Peninsula, as well as the Malemut about the head of  Kotzebue Sound, are on the contrary very finely proportioned and  athletic men who can not be equaled among the Indians of the Yukon  region. * * * There were a number of half-blood children among the  Eskimo, resulting from the intercourse with people from vessels and  others, who generally show their Caucasian blood by large, finely  shaped, and often remarkably beautiful brown eyes. The number of  these mixed bloods was not very great.1905, Jackson:[92]  The Eskimos of Alaska are a much finer race physically than their  kindred of Greenland and Labrador. In the extreme north, at Point  Barrow, and along the coast of Bering Sea they are of medium size.  At Point Barrow the average height of the males is 5 feet 3 inches  and average weight 153 pounds; of the women, 4 feet 11 inches and  weight 135 pounds. On the Nushagak River the average weight of the  men is from 150 to 167 pounds. From Cape Prince of Wales to Icy  Cape along the Arctic Coast and on the great inland rivers emptying  into the Arctic Ocean they are a large race, many of them being 6  feet and over in height.[93] They are lighter in color and fairer  than the North American Indian, have black and brown eyes, black  hair, some with a tinge of brown, high cheek bones, fleshy faces,  small hands and feet, and good teeth. The men have thin beards.1916, Hawkes:[94]  The Alaskan Eskimo are a taller and more symmetrical people than  their brethren of the central and eastern districts. They lack  that appearance of stoutness and squatness inherent in the eastern  stock, and for proportion and development of the various parts of  the body they do not compare unfavorably with Indians and whites.  It is not unusual to find in an Alaskan Eskimo village several  men who are 6 feet tall, with magnificent shoulders and arms and  bodily strength in proportion. The usual height, however, is about  168 centimeters for men, which is some 10 centimeters above the  height of the eastern Eskimo. * * * The average for women among the  western Eskimo is 158 centimeters, which approximates the height  of the men in the Hudson Bay region, 158 centimeters (Boas). The  female type in Alaska is taller and slimmer than in the east, and  the width of the face is considerably less. Eskimo women of large  stature are often seen in the northern section of Alaska. The  individual variation here is more conspicuous than in Labrador or  Hudson Bay.1923, Jenness:[95]  In his report on the Copper Eskimos, D. Jenness gives excellent  descriptive notes on this group with references to others. These  notes, too voluminous to be transcribed, may well be consulted in  these connections.FOOTNOTES:[67] Cook, Capt. James, and Capt. James King. A Voyage to the PacificOcean.

As seen before, Beecheyalso stated that the stature of the Eskimo increases from the east tothe west.In 1881-82, Lieutenant Ray collects and in 1885 reports evidentlycareful measurements of 51 men and 30 women from the villages ofUglaamie, at Cape Smythe, now Barrow, and Nuwuk, on Point Barrow.[96]An abstract of the data shows as follows:  Average height: Male, 5 feet 3½ inches (161.3 centimeters); female,    4 feet 11¾ inches (151.8 centimeters).  Average weight: Male, 153⅗ pounds; female, 135⅔ pounds.  Tallest male: 5 feet 8¾ inches (174.6 centimeters).  Tallest female: 5 feet 3 inches (160 centimeters).  Shortest male: 4 feet 11 inches (149.9 centimeters).  Shortest female: 4 feet ½ inch (123.2 centimeters).  Weight: Male, 126 to 204 pounds; female, 106 to 172 pounds.In 1892, in connection with the preparation of the anthropologicalexhibits for the World Exposition at Chicago, an extensive effortwas made under the direction of Frederick W. Putnam and Franz Boasto secure, by the help of a group of specially instructed students,physical data on many tribes of the American aborigines, and thisincluded a contingent of the western Eskimo. An abstract of the resultswas reported by Boas in 1895.[97] The locality where the Eskimo weremeasured is not given, but it was most likely Nome or St. MichaelIsland. Thirty-four men gave the high (for the Eskimo) average of 165.8centimeters, an unstated number of women an equally elevated average of155.1 centimeters. No details are given. There is also given the meanand distribution of the cephalic index on 114 living western Eskimo ofboth sexes. (On chart, p. 395, the number is 141.) The mean index was79.2. There are again, as under Stature, no details as to locality, andnone could be obtained from the author.In 1901 Deniker, in his Races of Man (p. 580), reports the stature of85 Eskimo of Alaska, doubtless males, as 163 centimeters. There are nodetails, no references, and I have not been able to trace the source ofthe measurement.During the years 1897-1899 A. J. Stone made an extended journey along aportion of the upper Yukon and through parts of northwestern Alaska andthe Mackenzie River basin, for the American Museum of Natural History.On this journey he made some measurements of Indian and Eskimo, andthese were published in 1901 by Franz Boas.[98] The Eskimo measuredwere the "Nunatagmiut" (11 males, 5 females), of the Noatak River,Alaska, and the "Koukpagmiut," (12 males, 6 females), east of the mouthof the Mackenzie. The Noataks, who alone interest us more closely here,gave the relatively high (for Eskimo) stature of 167.9 centimeters inthe men and 155.6 centimeters in the women. The number of subjects issmall and there may possibly have been some unconscious selection;yet it is clear that in this group there are numerous fairly tallindividuals.

H.THE SKULLThe first western Eskimo skull collected for scientific purposes wasapparently that of a female St. Lawrence Islander. It was taken fromthe rocks of the island by the Kotzebue party in 1817. It was reportedupon phrenologically in 1822 by Gall.[105]In 1839 Morton, in his "Crania Americana" (p. 248), gives measurementsand the illustration of a western Eskimo skull from Icy Cape, collectedby Dr. A. Collie, surgeon of H. M. S. _Blossom_. The principalmeasurements of this evidently female skull were: Length, 17.02centimeters; breadth, 12.70; height, 12.70. Cephalic index, _74.6_.In 1862[106] and 1863[107] Daniel Wilson reports briefly on sixTchuktchi skulls, which were probably those of Asiatic Eskimo. He says:  My opportunities for examining Esquimaux crania have been  sufficient to furnish me with very satisfactory data for forming  an opinion on the true Arctic skull form. In addition to the  measurements of 38 skulls, * * * I have recently compared and  carefully measured six Tchuktchi [probably Asiatic coast Eskimo]  skulls, in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution, exhumed  from the burial place of a village called Tergnyune, on the island  of Arikamcheche, at Glassnappe Harbor, west of Bering Strait, and  during a recent visit to Philadelphia I enjoyed the advantage of  examining, in company with Dr. J. Aitken Meigs, a series of 125  [eastern] Esquimaux crania, obtained by Doctor Hayes during his  Arctic journey of 1860. The comparison between the Tchuktchi and  the true Esquimaux skull is interesting. Without being identical,  the correspondence in form is such as their languages and other  affinities would suggest. Of the former, moreover, the number is  too few, and the derivation of all of them from one cemetery adds  to the chances of exceptional family features; but on carefully  examining the Hayes collection with a view to this comparison, I  found it was quite possible to select an equal number of Esquimaux  crania closely corresponding to the Tchuktchi type, which indeed  presents the most prominent characteristics of the former, only  less strongly marked.In Prehistoric Man, Volume II, Plate XV, this author gives also themeasurements of the Icy Cape skull recorded by Morton.The principal mean measurements of the six Tchuktchi skulls (bothsexes) were: Height, 17.60 centimeters; breadth, 13.59; height, 13.77;cranial index, _77.2_.The next measurements on western Eskimo crania are those given in 1867by J. Barnard Davis (_Thes. cran._). This author measured 6 skulls, 3of which were from Port Clarence (Seward Peninsula), 2 from KotzebueSound, and 1 from Cape Lisburne. The measurements, regrettably, are ininches. They include the greatest glabello-occipital length, greatestbreadth, height (plane of for. magn. to vertex), height of face(chin-nasion), and breadth of face (d. bizygom. max.). The cranialindex of the 4 specimens identified as male averaged _75.5_ (75-76),that of the 2 females _77.5_ (77-78). On page 226 the author mentionsalso an artificially deformed skull of a Koniag; this was in allprobability a wrong identification for no such deformations are knownfrom the island (Kodiak).In 1868 Jeffries Wyman[108] published measurements of 5 skulls of"Tsuktshi," the same as those of Daniel Wilson, and of 5 from the YukonRiver, "three of which are Mahlemuts."The identification of the specimens was partly erroneous. The data withcorrected identification are republished by Dall (q. v.) in 1877. Andthe same skulls figure in all future measurements.In 1875 Topinard[109] gives the Barnard Davis measurements in metricform without, so far as the western Eskimo are concerned, any additions.The main measurements of Barnard Davis's western Eskimo skulls,converted to metric values, follow. The sex identification in some ofthe specimens is doubtful.  ---------------------------------+--------+---------+----------+---------                                   | Skull  | Breadth |Height (to| Cranial                                   | length |         | vertex)  |  index  ---------------------------------+--------+---------+----------+---------  Port Clarence, male              |   17.8 |   13.45 |   -14    |  _75.7_      Do                           |   17.8 |   13.45 |    14.2  |  _75.7_  Port Clarence, female            |  -18   |  -14    |    13.45 |  _77.5_                                   +--------+---------+----------+---------        Means of the three         |  17.86 |   13.64 |    13.59 |  _76.4_                                   +========+=========+==========+=========  Kotzebue Sound, male             |   17.55|   13.2  |    13.45 |  _75.4_  Kotzebue Sound, female           |   17.3 |   13.45 |    13.7  |  _77.9_                                   +--------+---------+----------+---------        Means of the two (probably |        |         |          |          both females)            |   17.4 |   13.35 |    13.6  |  _76.6_                                   +========+=========+==========+=========  Cape Lisburne, male              |   18.3 |   14.2  |   -14    |  _77.8_  ---------------------------------+--------+---------+----------+---------The next records are those by George A. Otis, published in 1876 inthe Check List of the Specimens in the Section of Anatomy of theUnited States Army Medical Museum, Washington (pp. 13-15). Aside fromthose on Greenland crania the author gives here the measurements of 3presumably Eskimo skulls collected by Dall; of 2 western Eskimo skulls,no locality; and of 3 Mahlemut skulls, probably from Norton Sound (St.Michael Island). In his later (1880) catalogue,[110] page 13, Otis addsto the above three skulls from Prince William Sound, which, however,were more probably Indian; the three Mahlemuts, on the other hand, aregiven with the Alaskan Indians (p. 35). These data are of but littlevalue. The Eskimo skulls are the same Smithsonian specimens that werereported upon in 1868 by Jeffries Wyman.In 1878, Rae[111] mentions some measurements or observations on theskulls of Western Eskimo by Flower, but no records of these could belocated. Rae says:  I had the privilege of attending the series of admirable lectures  so ably given by Professor Flower at the Royal College of Surgeons  a few weeks ago on the "Comparative Anatomy of Man," from which I  derived much useful information and on one point very considerable  food for thought.  I allude to the wonderful difference in form exhibited between  the skulls of the Eskimos from the neighborhood of Bering  Strait, and of those inhabiting Greenland, the latter being  extremely dolichocephalic, whilst the former are the very  opposite--brachycephalic, the natives of the intermediate coast,  from the Coppermine River eastward, having mesocephalic heads.In 1879 Lucien Carr, in his "Observations on the Crania from the SantaBarbara Islands, California"[112] (p. 281), gives erroneously Otis'smeasurements of Aleut skulls as those of "Alaskan Eskimo."Meanwhile W. H. Dall has published (1877) his monograph on the "Tribesof the Extreme Northwest,"[113] in which he includes Wyman's and alsosome of Otis's data on the Eskimo (and Aleut) skulls from Alaska andAsia. The Tshuktshi are now classed as Asiatic Eskimo, the Mahlemuts asEskimo from St. Michael Island. The total number of skulls described inthe former series is 11, in the latter series 6 (of Aleuts the numberof skulls measured is 27 adults and 7 children). The means of theprincipal measurements of the Eskimo series, both sexes together, areas follows:  JEFFRIES WYMAN'S AND OTIS'S MEASUREMENTS OF WESTERN ESKIMO CRANIA  --------------------------+--------+---------+--------+---------     Crania (both sexes)    | Length | Breadth | Height | Cranial                            |        |         |        |  index  --------------------------+--------+---------+--------+---------                            |   (11) |    (11) |    (7) |   (11)  Asiatic Eskimo            |   17.8 |    14.1 |   13.2 |  _79.3_                            |        |         |        |                            |    (6) |     (6) |    (6) |    (6)  Northwest American Eskimo |   17.5 |    13.2 |   13.1 |  _75.1_  --------------------------+--------+---------+--------+---------There were also taken the weight, capacity, circumference, longitudinalarch, length of the frontal, parietal, and occipital, "zygomaticdiameter," and in two specimens of each series the facial angle. To-daythese data have but a historical value.In 1882, Quatrefages and Hamy,[114] in their "Crania ethnica" (p.440) give the measurements of two male Kaniagmiouts (Kodiak Indian,A. Pinart, collector) and one female Mahlemiout. The principalmeasurements of these skulls are as follows:  ----------------------+----------+-----------                        | Males (2)| Female (1)  ----------------------+----------+-----------  Skull:                |          |      Length            |   18.6   |    17.9      Breadth           |   14.2   |    13.9      Height (bas.-bg.) |   14.3   |    13.2  Cranial index         |  _76.34_ |   _77.65_  Nose:                 |          |      Length            |    5.9   |     5.1      Breadth           |    2.3   |     2.3  Nasal index           |  _38.98_ |   _45.09_  Facial index, total   |  _77.69_ |   _70.37_  Orbital index         |  _92.68_ |   _90.24_  ----------------------+----------+-----------In 1883 Dr. Irving C. Rosse, in his "Medical and Anthropological Noteson Alaska,"[115] refers to his examination of a number of Eskimoskulls from the St. Lawrence Island brought to the Army MedicalMuseum.[116] There are no measurements outside of a reference to thecapacity, but there are two excellent chromolithographs showing twofemale crania, besides a number of outline drawings.The next data on the western Eskimo skull are in rather unsatisfactorycondition. They are those of Boas. In his report on the "Anthropologieder nordamerikanischen Indianer,"[117] Doctor Boas mentions the cranialindex of the Alaska Eskimo to average _77_; and on page 397 he reportsthe same index as secured on 37 "Alaska Eskimo" skulls, apparently ofboth sexes. The only note relating to these figures is found on page393, where it is stated that these results proceed from measurementsthat had been made for the author at the Peabody Museum, Cambridge, theAmerican Museum, New York, the Academy of Sciences, Philadelphia, andthe United States Army Medical Museum, Washington; and that he utilizedalso the measurements of Barnard Davis and Otis. On 22 of the abovewestern Eskimo skulls there is also given the length-height index of_76.6_. There is no information as to either sex or locality. There areno other measurements.Deniker (1901) and later Martin (1914) repeat the data given by Boas.In 1890 Tarenetzky[118] publishes measurements and observations on fourKoniag (Kodiak) skulls and one Oglemute (Aglegmute, Alaska Peninsula).The main measurements (pp. 70-71) are:  -----------------+----------+-------+-------+-------+---------+----------                   Koneage[119]Koneage|Koneage|Koneage|Means[120]                   |          |       |       |       | of the  | Aglegm-                   |          |       |       |       |four from|   jute                   |          |       |       |       | Kodiak  | (Alaska                   |          |       |       |       | Island  |Peninsula)  -----------------+----------+-------+-------+-------+---------+----------  Skull:           |          |       |       |       |         |      Length       |    17.1  |  16.4 |  17.2 |  16.8 |   16.88 |    19.0      Breadth      |    13.8  |  15.7 |  15.8 |  14.4 |   14.93 |    13.7      Height       |    13.1  |  14.4 |  14.0 |  13.2 |   13.68 |    14.1      Cranial index|   _80.7_ | _95.7_| _91.8_| _85.7_|  _88.4_ |   _72.1_  Nose:            |          |       |       |       |         |      Length       |     4.7  |   5.3 |   5.7 |   5.9 |    5.40 |     5.8      Breadth      |     2.4  |   2.5 |   2.6 |   2.3 |    2.45 |     2.3      Nasal index  |   _51.0_ | _47.1_| _46.6_| _39.0_|  _45.4_ |   _39.6_      Orbital index|   _87.5_ | _97.6_| _92.7_| _80.9_|  _89.7_ |   _88.1_  -----------------+----------+-------+-------+-------+---------+----------In 1900 Sergi[121] reports on four Kodiak skulls that he examined inParis. Two of these are probably Aleut (or Indian). The cranial indiceswere, respectively, _75.8_, _78.3_, _88_, and _88.2_.In 1916 E. W. Hawkes presented a thesis on the "Skeletal Measurementsand Observations on the Point Barrow Eskimo, with Comparisons fromother Eskimo Groups."[122] The number of skulls measured was 27,of which 14 were identified as adult males, 5 adult females, 6adolescents, and 2 infants. In addition there are measurements by RalphLinton of other skeletal parts than the skull of three skeletons.The measurements, though the first taken by this author, have evidentlybeen taken in a painstaking manner and according to modern methods, andare therefore of some value. An abstract of those on the adults follows:  PRINCIPAL MEASUREMENTS OF POINT BARROW CRANIA, BY HAWKES  -------------------+------------+-------------                     | Males (14) | Females (5)  -------------------+------------+-------------  Vault:             |            |      Length         |     18.91  |      17.86      Breadth        |     13.73  |      13.58      Basion-bregma  |            |        height       |     13.86  |      13.30      Cranial index  |    _72.65_ |     _76.06_      Height-length  |            |        index        |    _73.24_ |     _74.45_      Height-breadth |            |        index        |   _100.68_ |     _98.01_  Face:              |            |      Diam. bizygom. |            |        max          |     14.10  |      13.40      BF:BH          |            |        proportion   |   _102.6_  |     _98.7_      Chin-nasion    |      (6)   |        (3)        height       |    13.15   |      11.60      Alveolar       |     (14)   |        (5)        point-nasion |     7.42   |       6.80      Facial index,  |            |        total        |   _92.13_  |     _52.48_      Facial index,  |            |        upper        |   _86.20_  |     _54.05_  Nose:              |            |      Height         |     5.66   |       5.24      Breadth        |     2.30   |       2.18      Index          |   _40.69_  |     _41.62_  Orbits:            |            |      Height         |     3.76   |       3.59      Breadth        |     4.13   |       4.05      Index          |   _91.3_   |     _88.5_  Dental arch:       |            |      Length         |     5.31   |       6.27      Breadth        |     4.96   |       6.06      Index          |   _93.4_   |     _96.7_  -------------------+------------+-------------In 1923 Cameron[123] published the following data on six western Eskimoskulls from Port Clarence, collected by the Canadian Arctic Expedition:              POST CLARENCE (SEWARD PENINSULA) ESKIMO CRANIA  -------------------------------------+------------------------------                 Vault                 |             Nose  -------------+-------+------+--------+------+-------+------+--------     Length    |Breadth|Height| Cranial|Length|Breadth|Nasal |Orbital               |       |      |  index |      |       |index | index  -------------+-------+------+--------+------+-------+------+--------  Males:       |       |      |        |      |       |      |      18.9     | 13.9  | 14.1 | _73.5_ | 5.9  |  2.5  |_42.4_| _86.4_      18.7     | 14.3  | 13.7 | _76.5_ | 5.3  |  2.5  |_47.2_| _85.7_      18.8     | 13.25 | 14.2 | _70.2_ | 6.0  |  2.2  |_36.7_| _86.4_      17.8     | 13.0  | 13.3 | _73.4_ |      |       |      | _88.9_      19.2     | 13.7  |      | _71.4_ |      |       |      |  Mean: 18.68  | 13.63 | 13.82| _72.97_| 5.73 |  2.40 |_41.9_| _86.9_  Female: 17.85| 13.1  | 12.8 | _73.1_ |      |       |      |  -------------+-------+------+--------+------+-------+------+--------The last contribution to the craniology of the western Eskimo beforethe present report are the data embodied in my "Catalogue of HumanCrania in the United States National Museum Collections," published in1924.[124] These data are embodied in those of the present report.For ready survey the old records on western Eskimo crania are givenin the following table.

There is doubtless much of significance in this remarkabledistribution. It is now quite certain that the Eskimo has not beenpressed out by the Indian; there are as a rule no traces of him fartherinland than where he has been within historic times. On the other handno Indian remnants or remains are known from any part of the coasts orislands within the Eskimo region; though the study of the older sitesin these regions has barely as yet begun, besides which (see Narrative)it is a serious question whether really old sites could now be locatedin these regions at all even if they had once existed. At all eventsthe Eskimo appears from all indications to be the latest comer, andjudging from his remains his occupancy here is not geologicallyancient; it is one to be counted, apparently, in many hundreds ofyears rather than in thousands. The Aleuts in the south are, as I havepointed out in the Catalogue (No. 1, 1924, p. 39), not Eskimo butIndians, related to the general Alaska Indian type; and the PribilofIslands appear never to have been occupied until fairly recently, whena good number of Aleuts, mostly mixed bloods, have been transported andestablished there in the interest of the seal fisheries.MEASUREMENTS OF LIVING WESTERN ESKIMOThanks to Moore, Collins, and Stewart, all of the National Museum,instructed by me and working with the same instruments, we now haveseveral small to fair series of measurements on the living westernEskimo of both sexes. They are tabulated below. They are the first madeon these groups and will be of much interest both in general and inconnection with the measurements made on the skulls and bones of mostof the same people. The main points shown are as follows:_Stature._--The stature of the males ranges from markedly to moderatelysubmedium. There is a considerable similarity. Only the Yukon groupand that of Togiak reach near or slightly above medium, the generalhuman medium for males approaching 165 centimeters. The female statureon the St. Lawrence Island averages 12 centimeters less than that ofthe males, which is about the difference found in most other peoples.At Hooper Bay, and especially at the Nunivak Island, the difference isless, indicating either that the males are slightly stunted or that thegrowth of the females is somewhat favored._Height sitting._--The height-sitting-stature index ranges fromslightly to quite notably higher than it is in other races, indicatinga tendency toward a relatively long trunk and somewhat short limbs.A study of the long bones shows that this is due especially, if notwholly, to the relative shortness of the tibia; and the subdevelopmentof this bone may, it seems, be ascribed to a great deal of squattingboth at home during the long winters and in the canoes. The male Eskimoshow more difference from other males in this respect than the Eskimofemales show from other females.[128]_Arm span._--Relatively to the stature the length of the arms in theEskimo males is shorter than it is in other racial groups, though thereappears to be some inequality in this respect. This shortness would beespecially marked if we compared the arm span with the height sitting.It is due essentially to a shortness of the distal half of the upperlimbs. The males once more show this disproportion more as comparedto other males than the females compared with others of their sex.(See comp. data in Old Americans.) This may be connected in some waywith the male Eskimo work and habits; or it may be an expression of acorrelative subdevelopment with that of the lower limbs. It is a goodpoint for further study._The head._--The head, especially when taken in relation to thestature, is of good size, particularly on the Nunivak Island and on theYukon. This agrees with what is known of the Eskimo head, skull, andbrain elsewhere.The size of the Eskimo head--which is not caused by a thick skull--willbest be appreciated by contrasting it with that of civilized whites.In whites in general the mean head diameter or cephalic module rangesin males from approximately 15.70 to 16.40; in the male western Eskimogroups the range is 15.87 to 16.08, and 16.11 in the group at Marshallon the Yukon. The percentage relation of the module to stature in 12groups of male whites, including the old Americans, averages _9.31_to _10.11_; in the male Eskimo groups it is from _9.57_ to _9.94_.In females, the cephalic module is 15.57 in the old Americans, 15.36to 15.68 in the Eskimo; the relation of the module to stature in theformer being _9.59_, in the latter _10.15_ to _10.25_.In the western Eskimo woman the head dimensions are particularlyfavorable. In the old American whites the mean head diameter in thefemale is to that of the male on the average as _95_ to 100; in the twomain groups of the western Eskimo it is as _96.1_ and _96.7_ to 100.Nothing is known as to the cause of this apparently favorable status ofthe Eskimo woman; it is another interesting point for further inquiry.In shape, the head of the western Eskimo is highly mesocephalic tomoderately brachycephalic and of only fair height, and it seldomapproaches the scaphoid or dome-shaped. It is not the narrow, high,keeled skull of the northeastern and often the northern Eskimo. Thephysiognomy, the characteristics of the body, and the mentality andbehavior, are in general typical Eskimo; but the form of the vault issubstantially different. It is a form which approaches on one sidethat of the northwesternmost Indian, and on the other that of thenortheastern and Mongoloid Asiatics. More must be said about this whenwe come to consider the skull._The forehead._--Anthropometric studies have shown repeatedly[129] thatthe height of the forehead is not a safe gauge of intelligence, ascommonly believed, but is controlled by the variable height of the hairline. Thus the common full-blood American Negro laborer and servantshow a slightly higher forehead than the educated old American whites.Something of a similar nature is found in the Eskimo. As seen inthe following table, in the males the western Eskimo forehead isabsolutely, and especially relatively to stature, higher than it isin the whites. In the females the absolute height in the two races isidentical, but relatively to stature the Eskimo again shows a clearthough somewhat lesser advantage. The condition is apparently not dueto the size of the head, for this is not greater than in the whites,in the males; while in the females, where the Eskimo shows a slightlylarger head than the white in relation to stature, the forehead failsto correspond.                          DIMENSIONS OF FOREHEAD  ---------------------------------------+---------------+----------------                                         |Western Eskimo | Old Americans                                         +-------+-------+-------+--------                                         | Male  | Female|  Male | Female  ---------------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+--------                                         | _cm._ | _cm._ | _cm._ | _cm._  Height, nasion to hair line            |  6.86 |  6.45 |  6.59 |  6.45  Percentage relation to stature         | _4.23_| _4.23_| _3.78_| _3.80_  Breadth: Diameter frontal minimum      | 10.58 | 10.54 | 10.59 | 10.12  Percentage relation of diameter frontal|       |       |       |    minimum to breadth of face           | _71.1_| _73.7_|_76.4_ |_77.8_  Forehead index (H × 100)/(B)           | _64.8_| _61.2_|_63.7_ |_62.1_  ---------------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+--------With the lower breadth of the forehead, conditions are alsointeresting. The absolute figures for the two races show a reversal.The height of the forehead is larger in the Eskimo than in the whitemales, equal in the females; the lower frontal breadth is equalin the males but larger in the Eskimo than in the white female.Proportionately to stature, which is so much lower in the Eskimo, bothsexes of the latter show an advantage in the dimension over the white.The percental relation of the breadth of the forehead to that of theface reflects the excess of the latter in the Eskimo, particularly themale. There is evidently not a full direct correlation between the twodimensions. Yet relatively to its height the face is broader in thefemales than in the males (see below), which is doubtless not withoutinfluence on the lower breadth of the forehead in the former.To summarize, the western Eskimo forehead exceeds in area that of theAmerican whites, in both sexes, and that particularly in relation tostature. As to the individual measurements, the male Eskimo foreheadas contrasted with that of the white is especially high, the femaleespecially broad.To which should be added that in the Eskimo the spheno-temporal regionis often remarkably full, almost bulging, so that, contrary to what maybe observed in the Negro, the frontal maximum diameter is also probablylarger than in the whites, all of which doubtless has significance,even though this is not yet fully understood._The face._--The principal measurements and relations are given below.They show a face large and especially broad. Moreover, relativelyto its height the face is especially broad in the Eskimo female,in connection doubtless with the well-known excess of the work (insoftening leather, etc.) of her jaws, with consequent development ofthe muscles of mastication, which in turn broaden the zygoma.

Compared with theold American whites, the bigonial breadth in its relation to stature ishigher in the Eskimo males by 15.5 per cent, in the Eskimo females by17.7 per cent. And measurements of Eskimo lower jaws in general showthat this breadth in the western contingents is not exceptional.

Nowhere in thisregion is it like the nose of the northern or northeastern groups. Itis decidedly broader. Its breadth is intermediary between that of theAlaska and other Indians and that of the northern and northeasternEskimo, connecting with both, and these characteristics are sogeneralized throughout western Alaska and the Bering Sea islands thatthey can not possibly be attributed to Indian or other admixture. Norcan this relatively broad nose of the western Eskimo be well attributedto environmental effects, i. e., to a broadening of a formerly narrownose through climatic conditions. There do not appear to be any suchconditions. The only rational explanation seems to be that this is themore original condition of the Eskimo nose, and that the northern andnortheastern narrowness is a later derivation. More may be said on thispoint when we come to consider the skeletal remains.[Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 39THE WALES PEOPLE(Photo by Lomen Bros.)][Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 40THE LONG AND BROAD-FACED TYPES, WALES(Photo by Lomen Bros.)][Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 41_a_, Broad-faced and low-vaulted Eskimo, St. Lawrence Island.

The nose, face, lower jaw, andother parts of the Eskimo anatomy offer rare opportunities for studiesin the heredity of acquired characters.

It is considerablylarger (wider) than in the old American whites, though these are ofmuch higher stature. In relation to stature the width of the westernEskimo mouth exceeds that in the white old Americans by 13 per centin the males and by nearly 14 per cent in the females, but there isa close relation with that of a large group of Indians.

They areespecially long. They exceed in both size and relative length those ofwhites, but are in both respects much more like those of the AmericanIndian. The excess in length, both in the Eskimo and the Indian, isespecially marked when this measurement is taken in relation to stature.Relatively to its length, the ear of the female Eskimo in all ourgroups is somewhat narrow, giving a lower index. This is not observedin the available whites and Indians.None of the series below are affected seriously by the age factor;though with an organ so much influenced by age as the ear the ideal waywould be to compare only groups of the same age.

They give not merelythe individual dimensions but also their relation, which is of muchontogenic as well as other interest, and their mean gives the chestmodule which in relation to the stature is anthropologically as well asindividually (medically) important.The table following gives the chest measurements in the western Eskimo,in a large group of Indians (my older data), and in the old Americanwhites as well as others.The Eskimo chest is large. In the males, in addition, it is very deep.Compared to that of the white old Americans it is markedly deeper inthe males and broader in the females, notwithstanding the fact that theAmericans are much taller. It is even larger, besides being relativelydeeper in the males and somewhat broader in the females, than it isin many tribes of the Indian. Only tall and bulky Indians such as theSioux show a chest that is absolutely somewhat larger, but in relationto stature, with which the dimensions of the chest stand in closecorrelation,[131] the Eskimo prevails even in this instance. Thisexcess in chest development in the Eskimo must be ascribed in the mainto his occupations and exertions, particularly again, it would seem, inconnection with the canoe.

The size of the calfcorrelates in a large measure with stature. Reducing our measurementsto calf girth-stature ratios, these are seen to be much alike in thethree racial groups used for comparison, namely the Eskimo, the Indian,and the old American white. But this is deceptive. The correlation ofsize of calf with stature is not uniform (see "Old Americans," p. 348)for all stature groups; as the scale in stature descends the calf isrelatively stouter. If we take white Americans of approximately thesame stature with the Eskimo here considered, there appears a higherratio, showing that stature for stature the girth of the calf of theEskimo is smaller, notwithstanding his generally more ample supply ofadipose tissue. Once more his relation is closer with the Indian. TheEskimo and the Indian women are especially much alike, while the whitewomen make a marked exception--their calfs (as well as thighs) havemore fat than is found in those of their Eskimo and Indian sisters.

Misc. Coll., Washington, 1912; Anthropology of theChippewa, Holmes Anniv. Vol., Washington, 1916; and Measurements of theNegro, Am. J. Phys. Anthrop., 1928, XII, No. 1.[130] A word of slight caution is due here. In all these casesthe proper way would be to compare the Eskimo with whites of samemean stature. But we have no such whites available. As it is thecomparisons must be taken merely as approximations, but they are soclose approximations that the substance of the conclusions is probablycorrect.[131] The chest dimensions correlate with stature, respectively thetrunk height, and the breadth correlates with the depth; but both areinfluenced by function.PHYSIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONSDue to various difficulties which do not exist to that extentelsewhere, the physiological observations on the Eskimo are neitheras numerous or extended as would be desirable; yet there are somedata of value. They extend to the pulse, respiration, temperature,and dynamometric tests of hand pressure. They were made mainly on St.Lawrence and Nunivak Islands, by Moore, Collins, and Stewart. Theyquite agree, especially after elimination of some records that areclearly erroneous or abnormal. The tests should be extended with evenmore rigid precautions in future work among the Eskimo.The results are given below. They were all made in the summer seasonand on healthy subjects, yet there were numerous indications oftemporary disorders, pathological or functional. Even after a carefulelimination of the obvious cases of such disorders not a few minorirregularities have doubtless remained, so that the data can not betaken for more than fairly close approximations to the normal.The data show remarkably low pulse, respiration rate and temperatureclose to those of whites, with a submedium hand pressure. (Forcomparative data see "Old Americans.") The low pulse is alsocharacteristic in the Indian, as I have repeatedly pointed out before(see especially my "Physiological and Medical Observations among theIndians," etc., Bull. 34, Bur. Amer. Ethn., Washington, 1908).The dynamometric tests agree also better with those on the Indiansthan with those on whites; they are valid only as to the hands, andthey embody not only the strength of the muscles but also that of theconscious impulse behind them. The age factor, of importance, does nothere enter materially into the case.               PULSE, RESPIRATION, TEMPERATURE, AND STRENGTH                        ST.

The distal parts of their extremities are relatively short.Walk in adult males somewhat awkward.In head form they are highly mesocephalic to moderately brachycephalic;the height of the head averages about medium. The head is of good size,especially when taken in relation to stature. The forehead is abovemedium in both height and breadth.The face is large in all dimensions, generally full and rather flat.In men it not seldom approaches a square form. The lower jaw region islargely developed, the angles of the lower jaw are broad to protruding.The nose is of fair breadth, with bridge somewhat narrow above and onthe whole only moderately high. The mouth is large, lips medium tosomewhat above. The ears are long. Beard spare on sides of face, mostlysparse on chin; mustache sparse and often limited to tufts above thecorners of the mouth. Expression generally good-natured, smiling.The chest is large, in females broad, in males especially deep. Thereis but a mild lumbar curve and no steatopygy. The lower limbs infemales are less stout and shapely than they are in whites. The handsand feet are small, but, particularly the foot, relatively broad.Temperature and respiration approach those in normal whites, thoughthey appear frequently to be slightly higher; pulse normally is slow.Dynamometric tests of strength (pressure, both hands) give somewhatlower records than in whites.FOOTNOTES:[136] Incorporated in this are writer's own observations.REMARKSThe most noteworthy and important result of these studies on the livingwestern Eskimo is the evidence, coming to light again and again, oftheir fundamental somatic relations to the Indian. These relations aretoo numerous and weighty to be accidental. Nor can they be ascribed tomixture with the Indian in such far-away groups as the St. LawrenceIslanders, who so long as known have never had any direct or evenindirect contact with Indians. These relations in dimensions andrelative proportions of the body, and in physiological characteristicssuch as the slow normal pulse, are supplemented by many phases ofbehavior, and often by a more or less Indianlike physiognomy. Theyinevitably lead to the conclusion that the Eskimo and the Indian are inthe root members of the same family. They are two digits of the samehand, separate and diverging, yet at base joined to and derived fromthe same source. And this source, according to many indications, is thepaleo-asiatic, "mongoloid," stem of northern Asia. The western Eskimoshows to be nearer this source than his more northern and northeasternrelatives, indicating either that he is a later comer, or, which ismore probable, that he has changed less in the south than in the north.It may be possible to say something more on this subject after theskeletal remains have been considered.[Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 45YOUNG WOMAN, NORTHERN BERING SEA REGION(Photo by Lomen Bros.)][Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 46YOUNG WOMEN, FULL-BLOOD ESKIMOS, SEWARD PENINSULA(Photo by Lomen Bros.)][Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 47A POINT HOPE GROUP][Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 48_a_, Eskimo woman, Kevalina.

The material in our own institutionscomprised a small collection of Mahlemut (St. Michael Island) and"Chukchee" (Asiatic Eskimo) crania made in the early sixties by W. H.Dall; a larger series of crania gathered in 1881 on St. Michael and St.Lawrence Islands by E. W. Nelson; 28 skulls with 3 skeletons brought in1898 by E. A. McIlheny from Point Barrow; a valuable lot of skulls fromIndian Point, Siberia, with a few from St. Lawrence Island, collectedby W. Bogoras; and some scattered specimens by other explorers. Tothis were added in 1912 an important collection of skulls, with afew skeletons, made by Riley D. Moore, at that time my aide, on St.Lawrence Island; an important lot of crania gathered a few yearslater by V. Stefánsson at Point Barrow; and a third large and highlyinteresting lot, this time of both skulls and skeletons, collected nearBarrow for the University Museum at Philadelphia in 1917-1919 by W.B. Van Valin. But none of the later material was described exceptingthe McIlheny collection which, in 1916, was reported upon by E. W.Hawkes.[142]During the survey which is the subject of this report a special effortwas made to collect all the older skeletal material along the BeringSea and Arctic coasts that could be reached, and the result was thebringing back of some 450 crania, nearly 50 with skeletons, and manyseparate parts of the skeleton; nearly all of the specimens proceedingfrom localities thus far not represented in the collections. To whichwere added in 1927 nearly 200 skulls with a good number of skeletonsgathered by H. B. Collins, jr., assistant curator in the Departmentof Anthropology, United States National Museum, and my aide, T. D.Stewart, on Nunivak Island and along the west coast of Alaska fromBristol Bay to near the Yukon delta.[143]We thus have now a relatively vast amount of skeletal material on thewestern Eskimo; it is essentially a virginal material; it is wellidentified as to locality; and the specimens are mostly in very goodcondition.Aside from Hawkes's thesis, nothing of note had been published onthese collections until 1924, when the first number of my Catalogueof Human Crania in the United States National Museum Collectionsappeared, which includes the principal measurements on 290 skulls ofthe western Eskimo. Since then, in view of the growing importance ofthe subject, I have remeasured every specimen reported before; havemeasured personally all the new collections; and thanks to the kindnessof those in charge have been enabled to extend the measurements toall the collections of Eskimo crania, both from Alaska and elsewhere,that were preserved up to the spring of 1928 at the National Museum atOttawa, the American Museum of Natural History of New York, and theWistar Institute of Philadelphia, which now contains the UniversityMuseum collections. The total records reach now to 1,283 adult skullsfrom practically all important parts of the total Eskimo area, besidesa considerable quantity of other bones of the skeleton. The mainresults of the work will be given here, the detailed measurements beingreserved for another number of the Catalogue.To save repetitions and possible confusion and to show more clearly thestatus of the southwestern and midwestern Eskimo, the entire cranialmaterial will be dealt with in this section, and previous records onthe northeastern and a few other groups of the Eskimo will not be drawnupon to preserve the advantage of dealing with data obtained by thesame methods, instruments, and observer.In presenting the records it is found expedient, both on geographicaland anthropological grounds, to make but three groupings. The firstof these comprises the Eskimo from their southernmost limit to NortonSound and the Bering Sea islands; the second group takes in SewardPeninsula (or the larger part of it) and the Arctic coast to PointBarrow; while the third embraces all the Eskimo east of Point Barrow.The first of these three groups is remarkably homogeneous, the secondand third show each some exceptional units. It may be said at once thatthe dialectic subdivisions of Dall, Nelson, and others, in a largemajority of cases are not found to be accompanied by correspondingphysical differences, so that in a somatological classification theybecome submerged.FOOTNOTES:[142] Skeletal Measurements and Observations of the Point BarrowEskimo, Amer. Anthrop., n. s. XVIII, pp. 203-244, Lancaster, 1916.[143] In 1928 Mr. Collins brought another important accession to thesecollections.SKULL SIZEThe external size of the skull is best expressed by the cranialmodule or mean of the three principal diameters; the internal size,respectively the volume of the brain, by the "cranial capacity."The module among the southwestern and midwestern Eskimo averages 15.44centimeters in the males and 14.77 centimeters in the females. Forpeople of submedium stature these are good dimensions. Fifty-two maleand 40 female skulls of the much taller Sioux (writer's unpublisheddata) give the modules of only 15.25 and 14.27 centimeters; while 6male and 9 female Munsee Indians, also tall,[144] give practically thesame values as these Eskimos, namely 15.48 centimeters for the malesand 14.75 centimeters for the females.Not all the western groups, however, give equally favorableproportions. In general, the coast people below Norton Sound, andespecially below the Yukon, give, so far as the males are concerned,the lowest values. It is interesting to note that it is preciselythese people who among the western Eskimo are reputed to be about thelowest also in culture. The Togiak and near-by Kulukak males showed,as seen before, also about the smallest head in the living. The St.Lawrence Island males stand just about the middle, but the females ofthis island, as, interestingly, also in the living, show markedly lessfavorably. The Nunivak skulls, as with the living, are somewhat abovethe average, while in the small Pilot Station (Yukon) group, just asin the near-by contingent of Marshall among the living, the males havethe largest heads in this western territory. The lower Yukon Eskimowere also shown, it may be recalled, to be of a higher stature thanthe majority of the coast people. It is a group that deserves furtherattention.The module of the female skull does not evidently stand always inharmony with that of the male. The most striking example of this isshown, as already mentioned, by the St. Lawrence Island females,both skulls and the living. The females of this isolated island arealso unduly short, but their small head is not entirely due to thedefective stature. There must exist on this island, it would seem, someconditions that are disadvantageous to the female. In the small groups,such as that from the Little Diomede, the disharmonies are doubtlesspartly due to small numbers of specimens, but there may also be otherfactors, such as the bringing in of women from other places.[145]Taking the mean of all the groups equalizes conditions, and it is seenthat the module in both sexes is almost identical with that of the morenorthern groups, to Point Barrow. But the north Arctic and northeasterngroups give a cranial module that in both sexes is somewhat higher,though their stature, according to the available data (Deniker, Boas,Duckworth, Steensby, Thalbitzer), is not superior.A very remarkable showing is that of the percentage relation ofthe female to male skull size in the three large groupings. In thefirst two it is identical, in the third it differs less than couldconfidently be expected among the closest relatives. Another remarkablefact is that this important relation is found to be much like thatin the Eskimo in various groups of Indians; thus it was _96_ in theIndians of Arkansas and Louisiana,[4] _95.5_ in the Munsee of NewJersey,[146] and _96.4_ in the Indian skulls of California.[147] Butit is only _93.6_ in the Sioux (52 male, 40 female skulls) and differsmore or less also in other tribes and peoples. A comprehensive study ofthis relation, with due respect to age, will some day well repay theeffort.

Amer. Ethn., p. 22, Nos. 326-313.[145] More or less danger in such cases as these lies in erroneoussexing of the skulls. Due to experience, care, and especially to therelatively numerous accompanying bones or skeletons, this danger in thepresent series has been reduced to the minimum.[146] Bull. 62, Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 23.[147] Cat. Crania, U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 2.MODULE AND CAPACITYA comparison of considerable interest is also that of the cranialmodule or mean diameter, to the capacity of the same skulls. Thiscomparison reveals an important sex factor.[148] Relatively to themodule, the capacity is very appreciably smaller in the female thanit is in the male. This is a universal condition to which, so far asknown, there are occasional individual but no group exceptions. Itappears very clearly in the Eskimo. In 283 western male Eskimo skullsin which we have so far measured the capacity,[149] the module averages15.38 centimeters, the capacity 1,490 cubic centimeters; while in 382female skulls thus far gauged the former averages 14.82 centimeters,the latter 1,337 cubic centimeters. The percentage relation of thecapacity to the module, the numbers taken as a whole, is _96.8_ in themales but only _90.2_ in the females. This means that relatively to theexternal size of the skull the female Eskimo brain is 6.66 per centsmaller. Similar sex disproportion exists in other American groups aswell as elsewhere. Some day when suitable data accumulate it will be ofmuch interest to study this condition on a wider scale.FOOTNOTES:[148] See writer's "Relation of the Size of the Head and Skull toCapacity in the Two Sexes," Am.

The first is that the figures on both sexesfrom Barrow and Point Barrow are very nearly the same, suggestingstrongly the identity of the people of the two settlements; and thePoint Hope group is in close relation. The second fact is the curiousidentity of the old Igloo group, 8 miles southwest of Barrow, with theGreenlanders. The import of this will be seen later.SKULL SHAPEUtilizing the materials of the Otis and Barnard Davis Catalogues andwith measurements taken for him on additional specimens in several ofour museums, Boas, in 1895 (Verh. Berl. anthrop. Ges., 398), as alreadymentioned, reported the cranial index of 37 "western Eskimo" skullsof both sexes (without giving localities or details) as _77_. He alsoreports in the same place (p. 391) the cephalic index of 61 probablymale living "Alaska Eskimo," again without locality, as _79.2_. Theserather high indices and the relatively elevated stature (61 subjects,165.8 centimeters) lead him to believe (p. 376) that both are probablydue to an admixture with the Alaskan Indian, though the report containsno measurements of the latter.The data that it is now possible to present may perhaps throw a newlight on the matter. As was already seen in part from the data onthe living, the head resp. the skull tends to relative shortness andbroadness throughout the southwestern, midwestern, and Bering Searegion (excepting parts of the Seward Peninsula). Important groups inthis region, particularly those on some of the islands, had little orno contact with the Indian. The cranial index in most of the groups ofthe southwestern and midwestern Eskimo equals or even exceeds that ofthe Indian. And Eskimo groups with a relatively elevated cranial indexare met with even in the far north, as at Point Hope, Hudson Bay, andSmith Sound.[150] Finally, the shorter and broader head connects withthat of the Asiatic Eskimo and that of the Chukchee, as well as othernortheastern Asiatics.[151]The records now available show the highest cranial indices to occur onthe coast between Bristol Bay and the Yukon and on lower Yukon itself,while the lowest indices of the midwest area, though still mesocranic,occur in the aggregate of Nunivak Island and the mouths of the Yukon.Another geographical as well as somatological aggregate is that of thepeople of the St. Lawrence and Diomede Islands and of Indian Point,Siberia, the cranial index in these three localities being identical.

There are a fewlocalities along its southern coast where the cranial type belongsapparently to the Bering Sea and southern area. One site at PortClarence was one of these. But already at Golovnin Bay, which isnot far from Norton Sound and St. Michael Island, and according tothe evidence of the most recent collections (Collins 1928), also atSledge Island, there is a sudden appearance of marked dolichocrany,which is repeated at Wales, on the western extremity of the peninsula,approached at Shishmaref, the main Eskimo settlement on its northernshore, and, judging from some fragmentary material seen at theeastern end of the Salt Lake, also in the interior. The cause of thisdistinctive feature in the Seward Peninsula is for the present elusive.The little known territory urgently needs a thorough exploration.The distribution of the cranial index farther north along the westerncoast shows several points of interest. The first is the exceptionalposition of Point Hope, one of the oldest and most populous settlementsin these regions, which by its cranial index seems to connect with theBering Sea groups. The second is the closeness, once more, of Barrowand Point Barrow. The third and greatest is the presence, in a smallcluster of old igloos 8 miles down the coast from Barrow, of a group ofpeople that finds no counterpart in its cranial index and, as will beseen later, also in some other characteristics, in the entire westernregion; in fact, in the whole Eskimo territory outside of Greenland.As noted before, the size of the head in this group is also closest tothat of Greenland. These peculiar facts indicate a problem that willcall for separate consideration.The northern and northeastern groups, with the exception of themesocranic Hudson Bay and Smith Sound contingents, and the verydolichocranic Greenlanders, show dolichocrany much the same as that ofBarrow and Point Barrow.FOOTNOTES:[150] Compare writer's "An Eskimo Brain," Amer.

Hist., 1904-9, XI, 33; 148male and 49 female adults gave him the mean stature of 162.2 and -152,the mean cephalic index of _82_ and _81.8_.[152] Including 4 female skulls collected by Collins in 1928 andreceived too late for general inclusion into these series.HEIGHT OF THE SKULLThis is a measurement of much value, both alone and as a supplement tothe cranial index, for skulls with the same index may be high or lowand thus really of a radically distinct type.The height of the vault is best studied in its relation to the othercranial dimensions, particularly to the mean of the length and breadth,with both of which it correlates. But in the Eskimo it is also ofinterest to compare the height with the breadth of the skull alone.The former relation is known as the mean height index and the latteras the height-breadth index. Both mean the percentage value of thebasion-bregma height as compared to the other dimensions.The mean height index H/(Mean of L+B), advocated independently by thewriter since 1916 (Bull. 62, Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 116), is provingof much value in differentiation of types and has already becomea permanent feature in all writers' work on the skull. There is acorresponding index also on the living.In the American Indian the averages of the index range fromapproximately 76 to 90. (See Catalogue of Crania, U. S. Nat. Mus., Nos.I and II.) Where the series of specimens are sufficiently large theindex does not differ materially in the two sexes. Indices below 80 maybe regarded as low, those between 80 and 84 as medium, and those above84 as high.[153]The southwestern and midwestern Eskimo skulls show mean height indicesthat may be characterized as moderate to slightly above medium. Ingeneral the broader and shorter skulls show lower indices, approachingthus in all the characters of the vault the Mongolian skulls of Asia.(Compare Catalogue Crania, U. S. Nat. Mus., No. I.) The Indian Point,St. Lawrence Island, and Little Diomede Island skulls are again, aswith the cranial index, very close together, strengthening the evidencethat the three constitute the same group of people. (Pls. 59, 60.)The northwestern Eskimo and most of those of the northeast haverelatively high vault. Barrow and Point Barrow are once more almostthe same. The Point Hope group shows a high vault, though also ratherbroad. The somewhat broad Hudson Bay crania are but moderately high,like those of the southwestern Eskimo. The northern Arctic skulls givesmaller height than would be expected with their type; the SouthamptonIsland specimens give higher. The old Igloo group from near Barrowstands again close to Greenland; its skull is even a trace narrowerand higher, standing in both respects at the limits of the Eskimo.The whole, as with the cranial index, shows evidently a rich field ofevolutionary conditions.

The face is absolutely and especially relatively tostature very large in all measurements. It is particularly high betweenthe upper alveolar point and nasion.The large size of the Eskimo face will best be appreciated from a fewfigures.

No face as large as that of theEskimo is known, in fact, from anywhere else in the world. In whitesthe mean diameter of the largest faces (see data in Martin's LehrbuchAnthrop., 789-791) does not exceed 10.36 centimeters. The above showingassumes especial weight when it is recalled that both the Siouan andthe Algonquian tribes are among the tallest there are on the AmericanContinent. The cause of the large size of the Eskimo face can only bethe excessive use of the jaws; no other reason even suggests itself.But the character may already be more or less hereditary. It furnishesanother attractive subject for further investigation.With its large dimensions the face of the Eskimo skull presentsgenerally also large orbits, large molars, submedium prominence andbreadth of the nasal bridge, shallow suborbital (canine) fossae,large dental arch above medium teeth, and a large and stout lower jawwith broad not seldom more or less everted angles, giving the whole acharacteristic appearance. With partial exception of the orbits and thenose, which are subject also to other factors, all these features ofthe Eskimo face are explainable as strengthenings resulting from theincreased function of mastication.The main dimensions of the cranial face in the three large groupings ofthe Eskimo are given in the next table.

The height of theupper face (alveolar point-nasion) is greatest in the southwestern andmidwestern groups, is slightly lower in the northwesterners, and stillfurther slightly lower in the north Arctic and the northeast. On theother hand the facial breadth is slightly higher in the north and east,and that although the vault has become mostly decidedly narrower.These facts are shown best by the upper facial index, which in themales descends quite perceptibly in the west from the south to thenorth and in the Arctic from the west to the east. In the females thereis a parallel gradual diminution in the upper facial height from thesouth to the north and then east, but the facial breadth diminishesvery slightly also instead of increasing, as a result of which theupper facial index shows only minor differences; yet these differencesare in the same direction as those in the males.These matters are involved with a number of factors--the stature, thebreadth of the vault, and the development and direct influence of thetemporal muscles, besides hereditary conditions. Their proper studywill necessitate even more--in fact, much more--material than is now atour disposal.The following table gives the distribution of the upper cranial facialindex in the various groups. Of the two indices that of the whole face,including the lower jaw, is the less valuable; first, because the jawis often absent; second, because it is influenced by the height ofthe lower jaw, which does not correlate perfectly with the upper; andthird, on account of the wear of the teeth, which in such people as theEskimo is very common and diminishes more or less the total height ofthe face. Its averages in the three main groupings have already beengiven. Its figures are not very exceptional.

The reason is the height of theupper face, for which the accompanying considerable expansion of thezygomatic arches does not fully compensate. In the white groups thisindex ranges from approximately _50_ to _54_; it averages _52.9_ in15 Algonquian and _53.1_ in 12 Siouan tribes. The means in the largeEskimo groupings are from a little below _54_ to a little over _55_.Its regional differences have already been mentioned. Sex differencesin the index are very small. There are a number of points ofsignificant agreement, the foremost of which is once more that in thecase of Barrow and Point Barrow, and especially that of the Old Igloosnear Barrow and Greenland.THE NOSEEqually as engaging as the whole face of the Eskimo skull is thecranial nose. Our data throw much light on this feature also.Where the dimensions of the whole face are altered by some cause thenose can not remain unaffected. This is especially true of its height,which correlates directly and closely with that of the face proper;the correlation of the breadth of the nose with that of the face isweaker and more irregular, but not absent where not counteracted byother factors. Accordingly with the high Eskimo upper face there isfound also a high nose, both being the highest known to anthropometry.But the nasal breadth, instead of responding to the considerable facialbreadth, has become smaller, until in some of the Eskimo groups it isthe smallest of all known human groups. There is plainly another potentfactor in action here. This factor could conceivably be connectedsimply with the above-average growth of the facial bones; but if thiswere so then individuals with smaller development of these bonesought to have broader noses, and vice versa. This point can readilybe tested. Taking the largest and best cranial series, that of St.Lawrence Island, and selecting the skulls with the smallest and thelargest faces, the facts come out as follows:  ----------------------+------------------------+------------------------                        |  Smallest development  |  Largest development                        |        of face         |       of face                        +-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+--------                        |  Face | Face  |Breadth |  Face | Face  |Breadth                        | height|breadth|of nasal| height|breadth|of nasal                        |(upper)|       |aperture|       |       |aperture  ----------------------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+--------  10 males              |  7.52 | 13.64 |   2.37 |  8.46 |  14.79|   2.49  10 females            |  6.81 | 12.56 |   2.37 |  7.54 |  14.02|   2.40  Percentage relation   |       |       |        |       |       |    of breadth of nose  |       |       |        |       |       |    to mean diameter of |       |       |        |       |       |    face:               |       |       |        |       |       |      Male              |       |       | _22.4_ |       |       | _21.4_      Female            |       |       | _24.5_ |       |       | _22.2_  ----------------------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+--------The above data show that while the narrow nose in the Eskimo is to someextent affected by the large development in these people of the facialbones, yet there must be also other factors.But if not wholly connected with the development of the facial bones,then some of the causes of the narrow nose in the Eskimo must either beinherited from far back or must be due to influences outside the faceitself.Pushing the character far back would be no explanation of its originalcause, but it may be shown that such a procedure would not bejustified. In the following important table are given the now availabledata on the breadth of the nasal aperture of the Eskimo, group bygroup and area by area, and these data show that narrow nose is by nomeans universal in this family. The nasal aperture is broader in thesouthwest and midwest than in the northwest, and broader in the latterregion than in the Arctic north, and the northeast. In general it isseen that the farther northward and northeastward the narrower thenose, until it reaches beyond that of all other human groups; while inthe west and southwest it gradually approaches until it reaches thenasal breadth of the Indian. And that this latter condition is notdue to Indian admixture is shown by the fact that among the broadestnoses are those of the Eskimo in Siberia and those on the St. LawrenceIsland, where there was no known contact with the Indian, while thenarrower noses are along the midwestern coast, where Indian admixturemight have been possible.

From the facts now at hand itseems much more probable that the Eskimo nose or respiratory nasalaperture was not originally very narrow, but that it gradually acquiredthis character as the people extended farther north and northeastward;and there appears to be but one potent factor that could influencethis development and that increases from south to north, namely, cold.A narrowing of the aperture can readily be understood as a protectivedevelopment for the throat and the organs of respiration.It is not easy to see how the bony structures respond to the effects ofcold or heat, but that they do, particularly where these are aggravatedby moisture, has long been appreciated, and shown fairly conclusivelythrough studies on the nasal index by Thomson and later by Thomsonand Buxton.[154] An even more satisfactory study would have been thatof the nasal breadth alone. Perhaps the normal variation with theelimination of the less fit are the main agencies.The next two tables show other interesting conditions. The first ofthese, seen best from the more general data, are the relations of thenasal dimensions and index in the two sexes. The females in all thethree large groupings have a higher nasal index than the males. This isa general condition among the Indians as well as in other races. It isusually due to a relative shortness of the female nose. This conditionis very plain in the Eskimo. The female nose is actually narrower thanthe male, due to correlation with shorter stature and lesser facialbreadth, yet the index is higher. The reason can most simply be shownby comparing the general mean nasal breadth and height in the twosexes. The breadth in the female is approximately 96.2 per cent of thatin the male; the height is only 92.7 per cent.

The Kotzebue group that shows even a higher index than onthe Yukon is too small to have much weight. Barrow and Point Barrow areonce more nearly the same, as are the Old Igloos and Greenland; andthere are some other interesting relations.

Taking the family as a whole, the mean height of the twoorbits in males averages approximately 3.64 centimeters, the meanbreadth 4.03 centimeters; while the males of 23 Algonquian tribes givefor the same items 3.42 and 3.93, and those of 12 Siouan tribes 3.58and 3.96 centimeters.The general averages for the female Eskimo approach for orbital height3.52 centimeters, for breadth 3.89 centimeters, dimensions which alsosurpass those in the females of any other known human group.These large dimensions of the Eskimo orbit are, however, on closerexamination into the matter, found not to be racial characters exceptin a secondary way. They are the direct consequence of the high andbroad face. The correlation of the orbital height and breadth with theheight and breadth of the face are shown by the following figures.These figures indicate also some additional details of interest.

Such orbits are classed as also _relatively_high or _megaseme_, a character in which they resemble many of theAmerican Indians. Thus the male crania of the Siouan tribes give thepractically identical general index of _90.5_.The slightly higher index in the females is the rule to which there arebut few exceptions, and those in individual groups where the numbersof specimens may not be sufficient. The same tendency is observable inthe Indians, and appears in fact to be panhuman. It is due to slightlylesser relative height as compared to the breadth of the orbit inthe males, which condition is due in all probability to the greaterdevelopment in the males of the frontal sinuses and supraorbital arches.

The westernas well as other Eskimo show arches that are about equal in absolutedimensions to those of our taller Indians, such as the Munsee,Arkansas, and Louisiana;[155] but relatively to stature the Eskimo archis decidedly larger.The upper dental arch index (L×100/B), now being used in preferenceto the unwieldy "uranic index" (B×100/L) of Turner, is rather high,showing that the arch is relatively, as well as absolutely, broad. Thesame index in the Munsee averaged in the males _82.8_, in the females_82.7_; in the Arkansas and Louisiana mound skulls _84.4_ in the malesand _85.1_ in the females. Data are needed here for more extensivecomparisons.

Notwithstanding the factthat on the whole the southwestern and midwestern groups are somewhattaller than those of the far north and northeast, the largest palate,in the males at least, is found in the latter area.In the southwest and midwest the upper alveolar arch is relatively(as well as absolutely, barring one group) somewhat broad and short.This may be in correlation with the broader head in this area, justas the absolutely slightly longer palates over the rest of the Eskimoterritory and particularly (in males) in the northeast may correlatewith the longer heads in those regions. This point may be tested onour splendid material from St. Lawrence Island. Taking the broadestand the narrowest skulls from this locality, the following data areobtained for the proportions of the upper dental arch:               ESKIMO CRANIA: DENTAL ARCH AND FORM OF SKULL                       ST.

The first is that the archis quite distinctly larger in the narrow than in the broad skullsin both sexes. The second fact is that the skull (vault) itself isslightly larger in the narrow-headed. The third is that the length ofthe arch is somewhat greater in the narrow and long skulls than it isin the broad and shorter, relatively to the skull size. The fourthis that there appears a close correlation, more particularly in thefemales, between the length of the arch and that of the skull.FOOTNOTES:[155] See Bull. 62, Bur. Am. Ethn., and writer's Report on anAdditional Collection of Skeletal Remains from Arkansas and Louisiana,published with Clarence B. Moore's report on the Antiquities of theOuachita Valley, Philadelphia, 1909.THE BASION-NASION DIAMETERThe anterior basal length (basion-nasion) is a measurement ofimportance, though its full meaning in anthropology is not yet entirelyclear. From data quoted by Martin (Lehrb., 715-716) it appears toaverage in whites up to 10.3 centimeters in males and up to 10.1centimeters in females, and is known to correlate closely with thelength of the vault. Secondarily it also correlates with stature.Data on American Indians are not yet generally available, though inpreparation. The Munsee skulls gave the writer for the diameter themeans of 10.27 for the males and 10.02 for the females; the moundskulls from Arkansas and Louisiana gave 10.45 for the males and 9.77for the females.An abstract of the data on the Eskimo skulls is given in the nexttable. The values for the measurement are rather high, especially forsuch short people. The percentage relation of the measurement to thelength of the skull appears also to be high. Manouvrier (1882, quotedin Martin, Lehrb., 716) found this relation in French skulls to be_53.6_ in the males and _54.7_ in the females.

As a similar relation of the cranial modules in the two sexesis close to _95.7_, the anterior basal length would seem to be at alittle disadvantage in the female Eskimo skull.The same condition is seen also when the basion-nasion diameter iscompared with the length of the skull. In the males, notwithstandingthe fact that the length of the vault is increased through thedevelopment of the frontal sinuses and not infrequently also throughthat of the occipital ridges, the percentage relation of thebasion-nasion to the maximum total length of the vault is approximately_56.3_, in the females but _55.8_. It seems therefore safe to say thatin the Eskimo, in general, that part of the brain anterior to theforamen magnum is relatively somewhat better developed in the malesthan in the females.But to this there are some exceptions. Thus it may be seen in thegeneral table which follows that in the northwestern groups conditionsin this respect are equalized; and in the succeeding detailed tableit will be noted that while the males exceed the females in thisparticular in 14 of the groups, in 5 groups conditions are equal(or within one decimal), and in 5 the female percentage exceedsslightly that in the males. In the numerically best represented groupsconditions are nearly equal, with the males nevertheless slightlyfavored.

All these comparisons suffer, naturally,from unevenness and often insufficiency of the numbers of specimens,yet some of the results are very harmonious with those brought outrepeatedly by other data. Thus the St. Lawrence material stands oncemore close to the medium of the southwestern and midwestern groups;Barrow and Point Barrow are almost identical; and so are the Old Igloosfrom near Barrow and Greenland. The St. Michael islanders show veryfavorably in the midwest, the Shishmarefs in the northwest and theSouthampton islanders in the northeast.

The St. Lawrence Island females are veryexceptional, as was also apparent in other connections. The unusualsmallness of their skull (compare section on Cranial module) isevidently due to a poor development of its posterior half.

The form of the arch is, however, quite influential.With the teeth identical in size a narrow arch will be more, a broadarch less protruding, and a narrow arch with small teeth may protrudemore than a broad one with larger teeth. Another influence is that ofthe height of the upper face, the same arch protruding more in a lowface than in a high one. And still another factor is the incline of thefront teeth, though this affects merely the appearance of prognathismand not its measurements.There are different ways of measuring facial prognathism, and withsufficient care all may be effective; I prefer, for practical reasons,linear measurements from the basion, which, together with the facialand subnasal heights, give triangles that can readily be reconstructedon paper and allow a direct measurement of both the facial and thealveolar angle. The three needed diameters from basion are taken, thefirst to the "prealveolar point," or the _most anterior_ point on theupper dental arch above the incisors; the second to the "subnasalpoint," or the point on the left (for convenience) of the nasalaperture, where the outer part of its border passes into that whichbelongs to the subnasal portion of the maxilla (the point where thesubnasal slant begins); and the third to nasion. The facial height isthat from the alveolar point (_lowest_ point of the upper alveolarborder in the median line) to nasion; while for the subnasal height,which can not be measured directly, I utilize the difference betweenthe facial and nasal heights, which is very close to the neededdimension.The important basion-nasion diameter has already been considered. Thatto the subnasal point needs no comment. That to the prealveolar pointshows in the western and other Eskimo as follows:             ESKIMO CRANIA: BASION-PREALVEOLAR POINT DIAMETER                                ALL ESKIMO  Males:      Mean diameter                        centimeters   10.54      Mean relation to length of skull        per cent  _56.3_  Females:      Diameter                             centimeters    9.99      Relation                                per cent  _55.8_                                   MALES  A = Basion prealveolar point diameter  B = Its relation to length of skull  +------------------+------------------+------------------+  | Southwestern and |   Northwestern   | Northern Arctics |  |    midwestern    |                  | and northeastern |  +------------------+------------------+------------------+  |    _A_     _B_   |    _A_     _B_   |    _A_     _B_   |  |   10.38  _56.4_  |   10.58  _56.4_  |   10.65  _56.2_  |  |                   Mean skull lengths                   |  |       18.41      |       18.75      |       18.96      |  +------------------+------------------+------------------+  |                         FEMALES                        |  +------------------+------------------+------------------+  |    9.85  _55.7_  |   10.06   _56.3_ |   10.06  _55.4_  |  |                   Mean skull lengths                   |  |       17.69      |       17.86      |       18.15      |  +------------------+------------------+------------------+As in other details, so here there is a remarkable similarity betweenthe skulls from the three large areas, pointing both to the unity ofthe people and to absence of heterogeneous admixtures. As the skulllength increases so does the basi-alveolar line, but the relativeproportions of the two remain very nearly the same.The relative value of the basi-alveolar length in the males, comparedto the length of the skull, is in general about 0.5 per cent higherthan it is in the females. This is just about the excess of therelative proportion of the length of the male dental arch when comparedto the same skull dimension. The general mean skull length in theEskimo male approximates 18.705, in female 17.899 centimeters; the meanlength of the arch is, in the male, close to 5.625, in the female 5.365centimeters; and the percentage relation of the latter to the formeris _30.6_ in the males, _30_ in the females. The relatively slightlygreater basi-alveolar length in the males is evidently, therefore, atleast partly due to the relatively longer male dental arch, which inturn is doubtless due to the somewhat larger teeth in the males.[156]Notwithstanding the just discussed slight sex difference in theEskimo, the facial angle, i. e., the angle between the basi-alveolarline and the line nasion-alveolar point, is equal in the two sexes.This equalization is due largely, if not wholly, to the effect in themales of the relatively longer basio-nasion diameter (v. a.), whilethe alveolar angle, or that between the basi-alveolar and the subnasallines, is in general by about 1 per cent lower in the females (males,56°; females, 55°), indicating a slightly greater slant of the subnasalregion in the female, which can only be due to a relatively slightlyshorter in this sex of the basion-subnasal point diameter. As a matterof fact, the percentage relation of this diameter to the length of theskull amounts in the males to _56.3_, in the females to but _55.6_.Compared to that in the Indians, the facial angle in the Eskimo skullsshows close affinities. Its value (69°) is very nearly the same as inthe mound skulls from Arkansas and Louisiana (males 70.7°, females69°). In other Indians it ranges from close to 68° to 71.5°. In theMunsee it reached 73.5°. In whites, according to Rivet's data,[157] itranges from about 72° to 75°; in a group of negroes it was 68.5°. InAmerican and other negro crania measured by me[158] it ranged from 67°to 70.5°, in Melanesians from 66° to 68°, in Australians from 67° to69°.The _alveolar angle_ is more variable. It shows considerableindividual, sex, and group differences. It averages slightly tomoderately higher, which means a more open angle or less slant in themales than in the females. In the Eskimo as a whole it was seen tobe approximately 56° in the males, 55° in the females; in the MunseeIndians (Bull. 62, Bur. Amer. Ethn.) it was males 59°, females 57°;in the Arkansas and Louisiana skulls (J. Ac. Sci., Phila., 1909, XIV)it averaged males 55°, females 52°. In my catalogue material it showsa group variation of 46.5° to 55.5° in the negro, 47.5° to 52.5° inthe Australians, 46.5° to 50.5° in the Melanesians. In the whites itgenerally exceeds 60°.Differences in facial and alveolar protrusion among the Eskimoaccording to area are small, yet they are not wholly absent. Thefigures below show that in the southwesterners and midwesterners, wherethe skull is more rounded, the prognathism is smallest; and that towardthe north and northeast, where the skull is narrower and the palate(dental arch) tends to become longer, prognathism increases. The "OldIgloo" group shows once more such affinity with the Greenlanders thatit is placed with the third subdivision.

(See next table.) The mostprognathic, especially in the subnasal region, are the skulls fromNelson Island. A marked alveolar slant is also present in the PilotStation Yukon group, and in Greenland. The least prognathic arethe St. Michael Islanders, the Point Hope people, and those fromSouthampton Island. St. Lawrence stands once more near the middle ofthe southwesterners and midwesterners, and there are to be seen theprincipal old relations.The main points shown by the above conditions are the groupvariability, particularly in the southwest and midwest; the tendency,on the whole, toward a slightly greater prognathy, both facial andalveolar, in this same area; and the evidence that the alveolar slanthas some individuality.

As elsewhere, so among the Eskimo, more childrendie than adults, but conditions are not favorable for the preservationof their skeletal remains. Most of the bones are done away with ordamaged by animals (foxes, dogs, mice, etc.), while others decay, sothat generally nothing remains of the youngest subjects and but a fewbones and a rare skull of the older children. The total number of suchskulls in our collection now reaches 25. They are all of childrenof more than 2 but mostly less than 6 years old, and are all normalspecimens. The principal measurements of their vault--a study of theface is a subject apart and needing more material--are given in thefollowing tables.

with those of the adults from the same localities.These comparisons, given in the smaller table, are of considerableinterest.The cranial index is considerably higher in the children. On analysisthis is found to be due almost wholly to a greater relative breadthof the child's skull. During later growth the Eskimo cranium advancesmaterially more in length than in breadth. A further expansion inbreadth is evidently hindered by some factor outside of the bonesthemselves, for nothing appears in these that could constitute such ahindrance. And the only evident outside factor capable of producingsuch an effect are the strong pads of the temporal muscles.The mean height index (H × 100/(mean of L + B)) remains much the samein the children and adults, indicating that the relative increaseduring growth in skull length compensates for the lagging increase inbreadth, while the proportion of the height to the mean of the lengthand breadth remains fairly stable.The much greater growth in length than in breadth of the Eskimo skullfrom childhood onward is shown even better in the second part of thetable by a direct comparison of the mean dimensions. The length of theadult skull is by over 9 per cent, the breadth by less than 4 per cent,greater than that in childhood in the same groups.The adult Eskimo skull has also grown very perceptibly more in heightthan in breadth, though somewhat less so than in length. The result isa notably higher height-breadth index in the adult. Compared to thatin childhood the adult Eskimo skull is therefore relatively markedlylonger, higher, and narrower.These facts are probably of more significance than might seem at firstglance; for it is precisely by the same characters, carried stillfurther, that some of the Eskimo differ from others. Let us comparetwo of our largest and best groups, those of St. Lawrence Island andGreenland:  ---------------------+---------+--------+---------+---------                       |  Number |  Skull | Breadth | Height                       |of skulls| length |         |                       |  (both  |        |         |                       |  sexes) |        |         |  ---------------------+---------+--------+---------+---------  St. Lawrence Island  |  (293)  |  18.05 |  13.90  |  13.45  Greenland            |  (101)  |  18.51 |  13.30  |  13.54  ---------------------+---------+--------+---------+---------The Greenland skull is longer, narrower, and somewhat higher. Thedifferences are less than those between a child and an adult westernEskimo, but of the same nature. This apparently speaks strongly forthe development of the Greenland type of Eskimo cranium from thewestern. On the other hand, the type of skull shown by the Eskimo childapproaches much more closely than that of the Eskimo adult to the typeof the skull of the Mongol.The above are mere observations, not theories, and they carry a strongindication that mostly we are still floundering only on the borders oftrue anthropology, embracing all phases of life and development, which,if mastered, would give us with beautiful definition many now vainlysought or barely glimpsed solutions.A highly interesting feature is the relatively great development in theEskimo, between childhood and the adult stage, of the anterior half ofthe skull or basion-nasion dimension. This augments, it is seen, byeven 3.4 per cent more than the length. This growth must involve someadditional factor to those inherent in the bones themselves and in theattached musculature, and this can only be, it seems, the developmentof the anterior half of the brain. Evidently this portion of the brainbetween childhood and adult life grows in the Eskimo more rapidly thanthat behind the vertical plane corresponding to the basion. It is avery suggestive condition calling for further study, and thus faralmost entirely wanting in comparative data on other human as well assubhuman groups.FOOTNOTES:[160] Same group for adults as for children.THE LOWER JAWThe lower jaw of the Eskimo deserves a thorough separate study. Forthis purpose, however, more jaws in good condition are needed fromvarious localities, and particularly more jaws accompanying theirskulls. As it is, a large majority of the crania are without the lowerjaw, or the alveolar processes of the latter have become so affectedin life through age and loss of teeth that their value is diminishedor lost. Still another serious difficulty is that the measuring of thelower jaw is difficult and has not as yet been regulated by generalagreement, so that there is much individualism of procedures withlimited possibilities of comparison.One of the principal measurements taken on the available Eskimomandibles was the symphyseal height. This is taken by the slidingcalipers and is the height from the lower alveolar point (highestpoint of the normal alveolar septum between the middle lower incisors)to the lowest point on the inferior border of the chin in the medianline.[161] The results are given in the following tables.

And the femaleEskimo jaw is relatively high compared with that of the male, beingexceeded in this respect only in three of the Indian groups, in two ofwhich, however, the showing is due wholly and in one partly to a lesserheight of the male jaw. The relative excess of the female jaw in thisrespect seems particularly marked in the northern and northeasterngroups, though it must remain subject to corroboration by furthermaterial.The white, Negro, and Australian data have an interest of their own.FOOTNOTES:[161] Should there be a decided notch in the middle, as happens in rarespecimens, it is rational to take the measurement to the side of thenotch.[162] From my Phys. Anthr. of the Lenape, etc., the Anthropology ofFlorida, and the Catalogue of Crania.[163] Approximately.[164] Rudolf Virchow, as far back as 1870, in studying some mandiblesof the Greenland Eskimo, found that the height of the body in themiddle (3.5 centimeters) was greater than that of the lower jaws ofany other racial group available to him for comparison. Archiv. fürAnthrop., IV, p. 77, Braunschweig, 1870.STRENGTH OF THE JAWThe Eskimo jaw is generally stout. Barring rare exceptions thereis nothing slender about it. The body, moreover, is frequentlystrengthened by more or less marked overgrowths of bone lingually belowthe alveoli and above the mylohyoid ridge. These neoformations will bediscussed later.The strength of the mandible may be measured directly in variouslocations on the body. Due to the peculiar build of the body, however,and especially to its variations, these measurements are by no meanssimple and wholly satisfactory. It is hardly necessary in thisconnection to review the various attempted methods, none of whichhas become standardized. As a result of experience I prefer sincemany years to measure the thickness of the body of the jaw at thesecond molars, and that in such a way that either the molars, if themeasurement is taken from above, or the lower border of the jaw ifit is taken from below, lies midway between the two branches of thesliding calipers with which the measurement is taken. The two methods(from above or below) give results that are nearly alike. In some casesthe one and in others the other is the easier, but wherever the teethare lost the measurement from below is perhaps preferable. The recordsobtained on the lower jaws of the western Eskimo and other racialgroups are given in the next table.

It is exceededin thickness only by the jaws of Florida, which in general are thethickest in America, and in males is about equaled, in females veryslightly exceeded by those of the prehistoric Indians of Louisiana,who belong to the same Gulf type with the Indians of Florida. Theold Arkansas Indians, though closely related to those of Louisiana,show a very perceptibly more slender jaw, particularly in the males;while in an old Kentucky tribe (Green River, C. B. Moore, collector)the jaws are still less strong. The lower jaws of the American whites(dissecting-room material) are slightly less stout than even those ofthe Indians of Kentucky in the males, and much less so in the females.The interesting sex differences are shown well in the last column ofthe above table.BREADTH OF THE RAMIStill another character that reflects the strength of the lower jawis the breadth of the rami. The most practicable measurement of thisis the breadth minimum at the constriction of the ascending branches.A great breadth of the rami is very striking, as is well known, inthe Heidelberg jaw, and the Eskimo have long been known for a markedtendency in the same direction. The measurements of the lower jaws ofthe western Eskimo show as follows:     LOWER JAWS OF THE WESTERN ESKIMO AND OTHER RACIAL GROUPS: BREADTH                     MINIMUM OF THE ASCENDING BRANCHES  ---------------------------+---------------+---------------+-------------                             |               |               |Female versus                             |     Male      |    Female     |    male                             |               |               |  (M = 100)  -----------------------    |----- -+-------+-------+-------+-------------                             | Right | Left  | Right | Left  |  ---------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------------                             | (243) | (240) | (237) | (228) |  Western Eskimo  centimeters|  3.99 |  4.03 |  3.68 |  3.70 |     _92_                             |  (20) |  (20) |  (13) |  (13) |  Florida Indians     do     |  3.82 |  3.85 |  3.39 |  3.34 |     _87.7_                             |  (21) |  (19) |  (19) |  (16) |  Louisiana Indians   do     |  3.72 |  3.72 |  3.29 |  3.27 |     _88.2_                             |  (62) |  (60) |  (58) |  (61) |  Arkansas Indians    do     |  3.47 |  3.47 |  3.24 |  3.23 |     _93.2_                             |  (42) |  (40) |  (30) |  (29) |  Kentucky Indians    do     |  3.44 |  3.44 |  3.18 |  3.21 |     _92.9_                             |  (50) |  (50) |  (20) |  (20) |  United States whites       |       |       |       |       |  (miscellaneous) centimeters|  3.17 |  3.14 |  2.89 |  2.82 |     _90.5_  ------------------------------------------------------------------------The Eskimo jaws, and particularly that of the female (relatively toother females), have the broadest rami.

The anterior point may, in consequence of a loweror higher location of the posterior point, range from the chin toabove the middle of the symphysis, but the results are much alike. Themeasurement leaves much to be desired, but is the best possible if thetwo halves of the body are to be measured separately.[166] The length of the whole jaw is measured on Broca's mandibulargoniometer, by laying the jaw firmly on the board, applying the movableplane to both rami, and recording the distance of the most anteriorpoint of the chin from the base of the oblique plane. This measurementis easier than the previous, though on account of the variation in theangles and the lower part of the posterior border of the rami it isalso not fully satisfactory, and it does not show the differences inthe two halves of the body.[167] Sliding calipers: One branch applied so that it touches thehighest points on both the condyle and the coronoid, while the otheris applied to the lowest point of the ramus anterior to the angle, ifthe bone here is prominent; if receding, the branch of the compass isapplied to the midpoint on the lower border of the ramus.[168] Sliding calipers: Maximum external diameter at the angles; themaximum points may, exceptionally, be either anterior to or a littleabove the angle proper.THE ANGLEThe angle between the body and the ramus of the lower jaw is known todiffer with the age and sex as well as individually. Not seldom itdiffers also, and that sometimes quite appreciably, on the two sides.Racial differences are as yet uncertain.The angle, especially in some specimens, is not easy to measure, andthe position of the jaw may make a difference of several degrees.Numerous trials have shown that the proper way is to measure the angleon the two sides separately, and to so place the jaw in each case thatthere is no interference with the measurement by either the posterioror the anterior enlarged end of the condyle.Leaving out jaws in which extensive loss of teeth has in allprobability resulted in changes in the angle, the western Eskimomaterial gives the following data:                  WESTERN ESKIMO: ANGLE OF THE LOWER JAW  -----------+-------+-------++----------+-------+-------             |  Male | Female||          |  Male | Female  -----------+-------+-------++----------+-------+-------             | (224) | (217) ||          | (218) | (207)  Right side | 119.6°| 124.5°||Left side | 119.5°| 124.3°  -----------+-------+-------++----------+-------+-------In the male Munsee Indians the angle was 118°; in those of Arkansas andLouisiana, 118.5°; in those of Peru (Martin, Lehrb., 884), 119°. In thewhites, males, the average angle approximates 122°; in the Negro, 121°(Topinard, Martin).The angle in the female in the Eskimo is to that of the male as 104 to100; in the Arkansas and Louisiana series it was 103. In the whites theproportion seems to be a little higher.There are evidently, if we exclude the whites in whom the shortnessof the jaw conduces probably to a wider angle, no marked racialdifferences, but the subject needs a more thorough study on largeseries of sexually well-identified specimens, carefully selected as toage.The average angle on the right differs in the Eskimo but very slightlyfrom that on the left, though individually there are frequentunequalities.RÉSUMÉThe Eskimo lower jaw differs substantially in many respects fromthat in other races, particularly from that of the whites. It ischaracterized by a high and stout body; by broad but low rami; and byexcessive breadth at the angles. The body-ramus angle is moderate.To which may be added that the chin is generally of but moderateprominence, and that the bone at the angles in males is occasionallymarkedly everted.MANDIBULAR HYPEROSTOSESThese hypertrophies or hyperostoses are rarely met with also inthe jaws of the Indian and other people. They are symmetric andcharacteristic, though often more or less irregular. They generallyextend from the vicinity of the lateral incisors or the caninesbackward, forming when more developed a marked bulge on each sideopposite the bicuspids, which gives the inner contour of the jaw whenlooked at from above a peculiar elephantine appearance. They may occurin the form of smooth, oblong, somewhat fusiform swellings, or as acontinuous more or less uneven ridge, or may be represented by fromone to four or five more or less rounded or flattened hard "buttons"or tumorlike elevations. In development they range from slight to verymarked.These hyperostoses have been reported by various observers (Danielli,Søren Hansen, Rudolf Virchow, Welcker, Duckworth & Pain, Oetteking,Hrdlička, Hawkes). They received due attention by Fürst and Hansenin their "Crania Groenlandica" (p. 178). They have been given theconvenient, though both etiologically and morphologically inaccurate,name of "mandibular torus"; I think mandibular hyperostoses or simplywelts would be better. Fürst and Hansen found them, taking all gradesof development, in 182, or 85 per cent, of 215 lower jaws of GreenlandEskimo; in 28 jaws, or 13 per cent, they were pronounced, the remainderbeing slight to medium. A special examination of 62 lower jaws ofchildren and 710 lower jaws of adult western Eskimo (with a smallnumber from Greenland) gives the following record:           LINGUAL MANDIBULAR HYPEROSTOSES IN THE WESTERN ESKIMO                                 CHILDREN     [62 mandibles, completion of milk dentition to eruption of second                             permanent molar]  ----------+-----------------+-------------+-------------+------------            |None or          |  Slight to  |             |            |indistinguishable|  moderate   |    Medium   | Pronounced  ----------+-----------------+-------------+-------------+------------  Specimens |       47        |  [169]10    |   [170]5    |  Per cent  |      _75.8_     |     _16.1_  |      _8.1_  |  ----------+-----------------+-------------+-------------+------------                                  ADULTS                        [Both sexes. 710 mandibles]  ----------+-----------------+-------------+-------------+------------  Specimens |     215         |     356     |     114     |     25  Per cent  |     _30.3_      |     _50.1_  |     _16.1_  |     _3.5_  ----------+-----------------+-------------+-------------+------------                                  ADULTS               [Sexes separately.

For Søren Hansen,[172] who first suggested the resemblanceof these formations to the torus palatinus, "the significance ofthis feature, which also occurs in other Arctic races not directlyrelated to the Eskimos, is not clear." R. Virchow,[173] who reports"wulstigen und knolligen Hyperostosen" on both the upper and lower jawsof a Vancouver Island Indian, restricts himself to a brief mentionof the condition with a suggestion as to its causation (see later).Welcker[174] found them in the skulls of a German (Schiller?), Lett,and a Chinese, but has nothing to say as to their meaning. Duckworthand Pain[175] report the "thickening" in 10 out of 32 Eskimo jaws, butdo not discuss the causation; and the same applies to Oetteking,[176]who reported on a series of Eskimo from Labrador. In 1909Gorjanovič-Kramberger[177] somewhat indirectly notes the condition,without a true appreciation of its meaning.In 1910 I had the opportunity to report on the mandibular hyperostosesin a rare collection of crania and lower jaws of the central and SmithSound Eskimo.[178] Of 25 lower jaws of adults and 5 of children, 18,or 72 per cent, of the former and 2 of the latter showed distinct tomarked lingual hyperostoses, while in the remaining cases the featurewas either doubtful (absorption of the alveolar process) or absent. Twoof the five children showed the peculiarity in a well-marked degree. Acritical consideration of the condition leads me to the conclusion thatit is not pathological, and my remarks were worded (p. 211) as follows:"A marked and general feature is a pronounced bony reinforcement ofthe alveolar arch extending above the mylohyoid line from the caninesor first bicuspids to or near the last molars. This physiologicalhyperostosis presents more or less irregular surface and is undoubtedlyof functional origin, the result of extraordinary pressure along theline of teeth most concerned in chewing; yet its occurrence in infantskulls indicates that at least to some extent the feature is alreadyhereditary in these Eskimo."In 1912, Kajava[179] reported lingual hyperostotic thickenings on thelower jaws of 68 adult Lapps, and found the condition in frequentassociation with pronounced wear of the teeth. In 1915, finally, Fürstand C.C. Hansen, in their great volume on "Crania Groenlandica,"approach this question much more thoroughly. They, as also Kajava,did not know of the writer's report of 1910. They found the "torus"(p. 181), "also in the mandibles of some various Siberian races in anot insignificant percentage * * * and also not infrequently amongEuropean races, especially in the Laplanders (30 to 35 per cent)."They also report the presence of the condition "in a Chinaman," andsaw indications of a good development of it in 17 per cent of 164middle ages to prehistoric, and in 12 per cent of later Scandinavianlower jaws. Their interesting comments on its possible causation,though at one point seemingly not harmonizing, are as follows (p.180): "The possibility is not precluded that we have here a formationwhich, even though it has at first arisen and been acquired throughmechanical causes, has in the end become a racial character, albeit avariable one." And page 181: "There seems to be no doubt whatever thatit is a formation connected with Arctic races or Arctic conditions oflife; and, accordingly, it can not safely be assumed to be a racialcharacter, however difficult it is to regard it as a formation onlyacquired individually."[Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY FORTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORTPLATE 61WESTERN ESKIMO AND ALEUT (MIDDLE) LOWER JAWS, SHOWING LINGUALHYPEROSTOSES. (U.S.N.M.)]With both the previously published and the present data, I believe thesubject of these bony formations may now be approached with some hopeof definite conclusions.These hyperostoses give no indication of being pathological. They areformed largely, if not entirely, by compact bone tissues of evidentlynormal construction. They never show a trace of attending inflammationor of ulceration or of breaking down. They resemble occasionally theosteomae of the vault of the skull, and more distantly the osteomaeof the auditory meatus, but in those cases where the bony swellingis uniform and in many others they show to be of quite a differentcategory. (Pl. 61.)As a rule these bony protuberances in the Eskimo are not connectedwith evidence of pyorrhoea, root abscesses, or any other pathologicalcondition of the teeth, for those conditions are practically absentin the older Eskimo skulls; therefore they can not be ascribed to anyirritation due to such conditions, and the Eskimo have no habits thatcould possibly be imagined as favoring, through mechanical irritation,the development of these bony swellings. Wear of the teeth, whichhas been thought to stand possibly in a causative relation to thesedevelopments, is common in many races and even in animals (primates,etc.), without being accompanied by any such formations.The development of such overgrowths is not wholly limited, as alreadyindicated from the cases reported by Danielli (1884) and Virchow(1889), to the lower jaw, but somewhat similar growths may also beobserved, though much more rarely, both lingually and on the outerborder of the alveolar process of the upper jaw in the molar region.When present in the latter position they interfere with the measurementof the external breadth of the dental arch.But, if neither pathological themselves nor due to any pathological ormechanical irritation, then these hyperostoses can only be, it wouldseem, of a physiological, ontogenic nature; and if so, then they mustbe brought about through a definite need and for a definite purpose orfunction.These views are supported by their marked symmetry, which is veryapparent even where they are irregular; by the fact that in generalthey are not found in the weakest jaws (weak individuals), or again inthe largest and stoutest mandibles (jaws that are strong enough, as itis); and by the history of their development.Our rather extensive present data on children show that theseformations are absent in infancy. They begin to develop in olderchildhood, in adolescence, or even during the earlier adult life; theystop developing at different stages in different individuals, and theynever lead to any deformity of the body of the mandible.These overgrowths are further seen to be more common and to morefrequently reach a pronounced development in the males than in thefemales.What is the effect of these hyperostoses? They strengthen the dentalarch. With them the arch is stronger; without them it would be weaker.The view is therefore justified that they augment the effectivenessof the dental arch; which is just what is needed or would be usefulin such people as the Eskimo where the demands on the jaws exceed ingeneral those in any other people.All these appear to be facts of incontrovertible nature; but if sothen we are led to practically the same conclusion that I have reachedin the study of the central and Smith Sound Eskimo, which is that thelingual mandibular hyperostoses are physiological formations, developedin answer to the needs of the alveolar portions of the lower jaw. Theycould be termed synergetic hyperostoses.The process of the development of these strengthening deposits ofbone is probably still largely individual; yet the tendency towardsuch developments appears to be already hereditary in the Eskimo, asindicated by their beginning here and there in childhood. But theirabsence in nearly one-third of the Eskimo mandibles, their markeddifferences of occurrence and development in the two sexes, and theiroccasional presence in the jaws of various other peoples, includingeven the whites, speak against the notion of these hyperostoses beingas yet true racial features.Taking everything into consideration, the writer is more than everconvinced that the lingual hyperostoses of the normal lower (as wellas the upper) jaw, in the Eskimo as elsewhere, are physiological,ontogenic developments, whose object and function is the strengtheningof the lower alveolar process in its lateral portions. Only whenexcessively developed, which is very rare, they may, mechanically,perhaps cause discomfort and thereby approach a pathological condition.FOOTNOTES:[169] None in the younger children.[170] All in older children or adolescents.[171] Danielli, J., Arch. p. l'antrop. e l'etnol., 1884, XIV.[172] Meddel. om.

For example, in mandible XIV H-8 the inward bulging of thebone was so marked that the transverse distance between the innersurfaces of the body opposite the first molars was reduced to 21.5millimeters. This jaw had therefore an extraordinary appearance whenviewed from below. (See fig. 5.) The writer would regard these bulgingsas bone buttresses built up by nature to resist the excessive strainthrown upon the alveoli of the molar teeth. He exhibited the mandiblesto Prof. H. E. Friesell, dean of the dental faculty, University ofPittsburgh, and this authority concurred in the opinion expressedabove." A disagreement with this view is expressed by S. G. Ritchie,pages 64c-65c, same publication.FOOTNOTES:[180] Danielli, Jacopo, Iperostosi in mandibole umano specialmentedi Ostiacchi, ed anche in mascellari superiore.

The only records are those on two skeletons (one male,one female) from Point Barrow by Hawkes,[188] and those on a few bonesfrom Port Clarence by Cameron.[189] The data on the skeletal parts ofthe northern and eastern Eskimo are only slightly richer, being for themost part fragmentary and scattered.[190] Nor has the time arrived yetfor a comprehensive study of such material, for notwithstanding therelative abundance in crania and the more resistant individual skeletalparts, the securing of anywhere near complete skeletons is verydifficult. Nevertheless there is now a good number of the long bonesof the western Eskimo in the possession of the National Museum andthe main data on these, all secured personally by the writer, will begiven. They must for the present remain essentially as so many figureswithout adequate discussion and comparisons. Nevertheless a few factsappear so plainly that they may well be pointed out before concludingthis section.FOOTNOTES:[188] Amer. Anthrop., 1916, LVIII, 240-243.[189] Rep. Canad. Arct.

shown by the preceding figures is the slightly greaterlength of all the long bones in the midwestern and northwestern groupsas compared with those of the Bering Sea (midwestern and southwestern).This means naturally that the people of the Seward Peninsula andnorthward average somewhat taller in stature.The second evident fact is that the people of the Seward Peninsula andthe more northern groups (so far as represented in these collections)show a slightly greater stature of all the bones than the groupsfarther south, showing that they were both a somewhat taller andsomewhat sturdier people.The next fact of importance is the remarkable agreement in somerespects in the relative proportions of the main skeletal parts betweenthe people of the more southern and the more northern groups. Themales are more regular in this respect than the females. The relativeproportions of the humerus and again the tibia at their middle areidentical in the males of the southwestern and midwestern groups andthose farther northward; and the radio-humeral, humero-femoral, andtibio-femoral indices are all very closely related. Why there should beless agreement in these respects among the females it is difficult tosay; in all probability the series of specimens are not sufficientlylarge.The next table presents data and some racial comparisons. Here thewestern Eskimo are taken as a unit. They are seen to considerablyresemble the Yukon Indians, but somewhat less so other Indians inthe radio-humeral and tibio-femoral indices, and they resemble allthe Indians in the relative proportions of the femur at its middle.In other respects there are somewhat more marked differences,especially between the western Eskimo and the Indians in general. Someirregularities in the Yukon series may be due to insufficiency ofnumbers.When compared with the bones of the whites and the negroes the Eskimoand Indians separate themselves in many respects as a distinct group,while the white and the negro bones are particularly distinct throughthe greater relative thickness of the humerus and tibia at theirmiddle, and of the femur at its upper flattening; in other words theEskimo as well as the Indians are more platybrachic, platymeric andplatycnemic than the whites or the negroes.The basic relation of the Eskimo to the Indian bones is quite evident;though the Eskimo, when compared to Indians outside of Alaska, show arelatively shorter radius and tibia, indicating the already discussedrelative shortness of the forearm and leg.FOOTNOTES:[191] Principally Hooper Bay, Nunivak Island, Pastolik, and St.Lawrence Island.[192] Mainly Shishmaref, Wales and Golovnin Bay.[193] Including Point Hope.[194] Number of radii

both sides.[197] Numbers insufficient.LONG BONES IN ESKIMO AND STATUREOne of the most desirable of possibilities in the anthropometry of anypeople, but particularly in groups now extinct, is a correct estimationof their stature. For this purpose the most useful aid has been foundin the long bones, and various essays have been made by Manouvrier,Rollet, Topinard, Pearson, and others[198] at preparing tables orarriving at methods that would enable the student to promptly andsatisfactorily obtain the stature as it was in life from the lengthof the long bones. But all these essays were based on observations onwhite people, and it has always been recognized that they could notwith equal confidence be applied to other racial groups. They wouldin all probability be especially inapplicable to the Eskimo with hisrelatively short forearms and legs; yet the possibility of estimatingthe stature in many localities of the Eskimo territory, where no livingremain, would be of real value. Fortunately for this purpose there arenow some data on hand which make this possible.In 1910, in my Contributions to the Anthropology of the Central andSmith Sound Eskimo, I was able to report both the stature and thelength of the long bones in two normally developed adult males andone adult female from Smith Sound. To this it is now possible to addlarger though less direct data from the group of St. Lawrence Island.We have the stature of many of the living from this place and also themeasurements of numerous long bones from the dead of the same group.The relations of the two are given below, together with correspondingdata from Smith Sound. There is in general such a striking agreement inthe relative proportions that the latter may, it would seem, be usedhenceforth for stature estimates also in other parts of the Eskimoregion.FOOTNOTES:[198] See section on Estimation of Stature from Parts of the Skeleton,in author's Anthropometry, Wistar Inst., Philadelphia, 1920.LENGTH OF PRINCIPAL LONG BONES, AND STATURE IN THE LIVING, ON THE ST.LAWRENCE ISLAND  ---------+---------------------+----------------------           |        Male         |       Female           +---------------------+----------------------           |        (63)         |        (48)           | Mean stature: 163.3 | Mean stature: 151.3           +----------+----------+----------+-----------           |          | Percental|          | Percental           |   Mean   | relation |   Mean   | relation           |dimensions|to stature|dimensions|to stature           |          | (S = 100)|          | (S = 100)  ---------+----------+----------+----------+-----------           |   (58)   |          |   (49)   |  Humerus  |    30.41 |   _18.6_ |    27.77 |   _18.3_           |   (23)   |          |   (35)   |  Radius   |    23.03 |   _14.1_ |    20.77 |   _13.7_           |  (100)   |          |   (38)   |  Femur    |    32.54 |   _27.8_ |    38.12 |   _25.1_           |   (58)   |          |   (50)   |  Tibia    |    34.16 |   _20.9_ |    31.13 |   _20.5_  ---------+----------+----------+----------+-----------LONG BONES VS.

Anthrop. Pap. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., V, pt. 2, 280.New York, 1910.A STRANGE GROUP OF ESKIMO NEAR POINT BARROWIn 1917-1919, in the course of the John Wanamaker Expedition for theUniversity Museum, Philadelphia, W. B. Van Valin, with the help ofCharles Brower, the well-known local trader and collector, excavatednear Barrow a group of six tumuli, which proved in the opinion of VanValin to be so many old igloos, containing plentiful cultural as wellas skeletal material. The collections eventually reached the museum,but due to lack of facilities they were in the main never unpacked.I heard of this material first from Mr. Brower, with whom I sailed in1926 from Barrow southward, and later with Dr. J. Alden Mason I sawthe collection still in the original boxes, at the University Museum.In April of this year the skeletal remains were transferred to theWistar Institute, Philadelphia, and after their transfer I obtainedthe permission of Dr. Milton J. Greenman, director of the WistarInstitute, to examine the material, which was of importance to him inconnection with his own collections from Barrow and southward. A dueacknowledgment for the privilege is hereby rendered to both DoctorGreenman and Doctor Mason.The study proved one of unexpected and uncommon interest. The materialwas found to consist of two separate lots. The first of these consistedof a considerable number of brown colored, more or less completeskeletons with skulls, proceeding from the "igloos"; while the secondlot comprised a series of whitened isolated skulls, without otherskeletal parts and mostly even without the component lower jaws,gathered on the tundra near Barrow. At first sight, also, the skulls ofthe two groups were seen to present important differences.The "igloo" crania, while plainly pure Eskimo, proved to be of adecidedly exceptional nature for this location. The skulls, in brief,were not of the general western Eskimo type, but reminded at oncestrongly of the skulls from Greenland and Labrador. And they wereexceptionally uniform, showing that they belonged to a definite anddistinct Eskimo group.After writing of this to Doctor Mason, he kindly sent me a copy of thenotes and observations on the discovery of the material by W. B. VanValin, who was in charge of the excavation. The detailed notes willsoon be published by Doctor Mason. The main information they convey isas follows:The excavations by Van Valin date from 1918-19. They were made in sixlarge "heaps," approximately 8 miles southwest of Barrow and about1,000 yards back from the beach on the tundra. Two of the heaps were onthe northern and four on the southern side of a ravine or draw formedby a drain flowing from inland to the sea. The Eskimo at Barrow knewnothing about these remains or their people.Each of the heaps inclosed what in the excavator's opinion was an"igloo" made of driftwood and earth; and all contained evidentlyundisturbed human skeletons. The total number of bodies of all ageswas counted as 83, and they ranged from infants to old people. Therewere many bird and other skins (for covers and clothing), and numerousutensils. The hair on the bodies was in general "black as a raven."Most of the bodies lay on "beds" of moss or "ground willows," orrough-hewn boards. There was no indication of any violence or suddendeath. The bodies at places were in three levels, one above the other;but there was but moderate uniformity in the orientation of thebodies. There were found with the burials no traces of dogs (thoughthere were some sled runners), and no metal, glass, pipes, labrets,nets, soapstone lamps or dog harness; but there were bows and arrows,bolas, and ordinary pottery. The cultural objects, Doctor Mason wroteme, resemble in a smaller measure those of the older Bering Sea, toa larger extent those of the old northern or "Thule" culture. Therewere some jadeite axes, indicating a direct or indirect contact withKotzebue Sound and the Kobuk River.Some of the bearskin coverings were "as bright and silvery" as the daythe bear was killed (Van Valin); and the frozen bodies were evidentlyin a state of preservation approaching that of natural mummies.Notwithstanding indications to the contrary, Van Valin reached theopinion that these remains were not those of regular burials, thoughoffering no other definite hypothesis.Desiring additional information about this highly interesting find, Iwrote to Mr. Brower, who assisted at the excavations, and received thefollowing answer:  These mounds are from 5 to 8 miles south of the Barrow village  (Utkiavik). The largest that were opened were the farthest south,  and seemed more like raised lumps on the land than ruins. No doubt  that is the reason no one had bothered them.  The Eskimo have no traditions of these people. In fact they did not  even suspect the mounds contained human remains until Mr. Van Valin  started to investigate them.  While Van Valin thought they might be houses, I have always thought  they were burial mounds, as there seemed no family to have been  together at the time of death as often has happened. When whole  families have died from some epidemic, then the man and wife are  together under their sleeping skins. In these mounds each party was  wrapped separate, either in polar bear or musk ox skins; none were  wrapped in deer skins. If male, all his hunting implements were  at his side, and if a female her working tools were with her, as  scrapers, dishes of wood, and stone knives. The men had their bows,  arrows, spears, and often a heavy club, for what purpose unless  used in fighting I could not make out. At the head of each person  was a small receptacle, made of whalebone, and in it or alongside  was a long wing bone that had been used as a drinking tube. In some  cases there seemed to be the remains of food in the platters, but  that was impossible to identify. Most of the bodies were laid on  the ground, a few had the remains of scrub willow under them, while  only in two or three cases had there been driftwood planks under  the bodies; these were crudely hewn with their old stone adzes.  There seems to have been some sort of driftwood houses over these  bodies at some time, but they decayed and have fallen on the  remains, which were in some cases embedded in the ice. Often before  the frame had broken down earth must have accumulated and covered  the bodies. In these cases the flesh has the consistency of a fine  meal. While with those in the ice in some cases part of the flesh  still remained. In both cases when exposed to the air they rapidly  disintegrated, leaving nothing except the bones. By measurements  they must have been a larger race than the present people.  When your letter reached here I at once started making inquiries as  to what mounds were still intact; and I find that as far as known  only two of the larger ones have not been opened. The Eskimo have  been opening the mounds ever since they were found, taking from  them all the hunting implements and other material and selling them  aboard the ships for curios. It seems a shame that all this should  be lost to science, and if no one takes an interest in these places  in a year or two they will all be gone.  I have again made inquiries as to what the present Eskimo think of  these people, but they tell me they have no tradition regarding  them and that they do not know if they were their ancestors or not.  In fact, they are ignorant of where they came from or when they  died.  To date I do not know of any whaling implement being found with  these old people, neither is any of the framework of these mounds  made from the bones of whales. In some of the implements ivory has  been used. The mounds farthest from the shore were about 400 yards,  those that remain are closer to the beach. Some of the smaller ones  are on the banks of small streams but never very far from shore.  Undoubtedly, however, they were at one time considerably farther  from the sea, but the sea is every year claiming some of this land,  especially where the banks are high along the beach. There the  beach is narrow and during a gale the waves wash out the land at  its base. This is about all that I can tell you of these people.  All credit for finding these mounds belongs to Van Valin.  Yours truly,                                                CHAS. D. BROWER._The material._--The collection as received at the Wistar Institute wasnotable for its general dark color, enhanced in many of the specimensby dark to black remains of the tissues. There was no mineralizationand but little bone decay, though the bones were somewhat brittle.There is a scarcity of children and adolescents; there are in fact onlytwo skulls of subjects less than 20 years of age in the collection.The skulls and bones that remain show no violence.The remains show a complete freedom from syphilis or otherconstitutional disease; the only pathological condition present in someof the bones being arthritis. This speaks strongly for their precedingthe contact with whites. The surface series, though smaller, showsthree syphilitic skulls. An additional fact of interest is the absencein both the igloo and the surface series of all marks of scurvy. Suchmarks are fairly common farther southward. Finally, none of the skullsare deformed, either in life or posthumously.ANTHROPOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS ON THE COLLECTIONS_Age._--The first observations made on the igloo material were those asto the individual ages of the bodies. Such observations are necessarilyrough, yet within sufficiently broad limits fairly reliable. Thecriteria are principally the condition of the teeth and that of thesutures. The possible error in such estimates is, experience has shown,as a rule well within 10 years in the older and within 5 years in theyoung adults or subadults.One of the objects of these observations on the "igloo" material wasto get some further light on whether the remains were those of a groupthat perished of an epidemic, famine, or some other sudden agency, orwhether they represented just burials. The age distribution of the deadwould differ considerably in the two cases.

Takingthe sexes apart, the series from the surface shows a somewhat morefavorable condition for the men, but worse for the women. Taking thematerials, however, regardless of sex, the proportions of ages inthe earlier igloos and in the late surface burials are practicallyidentical. This points strongly against the idea of the igloo remainsbeing those of people who either died there of starvation, of anepidemic, of being smothered, or of some other sudden affliction, andto their having been just ordinary burials.To arrive at something still more definite, if possible, I appealed onthe one hand to the United States Census and on the other to DoctorDublin of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York, for data as tothe distribution of ages among the dead, using the same age-categoriesas in the case of the "igloo" material. The data furnished by Miss E.Foudray through Dr. Wm. H. Davis, Chief Statistician of the Bureau ofthe Census, are particularly to the point. They are as follows:     PER CENT AGE DISTRIBUTION OF INDIAN POPULATION IN ALASKA AGED 20              YEARS AND OVER, ACCORDING TO THE CENSUS OF 1900  -----------------------+----------+----------+----------+-------------                         | 20 to 24 | 25 to 44 | 45 to 54 | 55 and over  -----------------------+----------+----------+----------+-------------  Males                  |   17.8   |   54.2   |   15.9   |   12.1  Females                |   19.4   |   53.3   |   15.9   |   11.4  Both sexes             |  _18.6_  |  _53.7_  |  _15.9_  |  _11.8_  -----------------------+----------+----------+----------+-------------    PER CENT AGE DISTRIBUTION AT DEATH (ESTIMATED) OF INDIAN POPULATION    OF ALASKA IN 1900, WHO, HAD THEY LIVED, WOULD HAVE APPEARED IN THE                 CENSUS OF 1910 AT AGES 20 YEARS AND OVER  -----------------------+----------+----------+----------+-------------                         | 20 to 24 | 25 to 44 | 45 to 54 | 55 and over  -----------------------+----------+----------+----------+-------------  Males                  |   13.2   |   43.9   |   21.3   |   21.6  Females                |   11.9   |   47.0   |   19.5   |   21.6  Both sexes             |  _12.6_  |  _45.4_  |  _20.4_  |  _21.6_  -----------------------+----------+----------+----------+-------------There is a remarkable agreement of these figures with those obtainedon both the Igloo and the Barrow surface burial material, except thatfor the two middle age series the figures are reversed. This may meanan error in the two respective estimates on the Indians, or it may meanthat for these two ages the conditions among the Eskimo concerned werebetter than they were in 1900 among the Alaska Indians.All the above, together with the details on the orderly treatment ofthe bodies, and the absence of such conditions as were encountered inthe dead villages on St. Lawrence Island (Hooper, Nelson), inclinesone to the conclusion that the Igloo remains, however exceptional themethod for the Eskimo, were just burials.PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS_The skull._--The most noteworthy feature about the Igloo remains isthe marked distinctiveness of the skull. This strikes the observerat the first sight of the specimens, and the impression is onlystrengthened by detail examination. The skulls are very narrow,long, and high. They differ plainly from anything except occasionalindividual specimens, either about Barrow or along the rest of thewest coast of Alaska, with the possible exception of a few groups ofSeward Peninsula. They recall strongly the crania of Labrador and southGreenland. It is the Labrador-Greenland type throughout, men, women,and even the two children. It is a group outside of the range of localvariation. It is a strange Eskimo group, either developed here informer times as it developed in Greenland and Labrador, and possiblythe Seward Peninsula, or one that had come here from places where suchtype had already been realized.The following data (the individual measurements will appear in a laternumber of the Catalogue of Crania) show the differences between theIgloo and the surface material, the latter both of the Van Valin andof the author's collections, and the valuable Stefánsson material,now at the American Museum, from Point Barrow. They need but littlecomment. They show clearly on one hand the wholly Eskimo nature of theIgloo skulls, and on the other their distinctness from those of thelater burials, both of Barrow and Point Barrow. The vault especially ischaracteristic--narrow, long, high, more or less keel-shaped. The facein general is much more alike in the three groups; nevertheless itsabsolute height and breadth in the Igloo series are slightly smallerthan in the other two, and there are minor differences in the orbitsand the palate.

TheIgloo skulls are even narrower in the vault than the Greenlanders,which means so much farther away from the southwestern, midwestern, andAsiatic Eskimo; and offer a few other differences, but all these are ofsmall moment, not affecting the essential relations of the two groups.A comparison of the Igloo and Greenland series with the materialfrom Golovnin Bay and Sledge Island shows also numerous similaritiesbut with them some rather material differences. The differences areespecially marked in the females, whose characteristics approachmore those of the midwestern Eskimo, which suggests that an importantproportion of them may have been derived from the latter. However,even the males tend to differ. Both sexes show absolutely a somewhatbroader skull than that of the northerners; in both sexes the skull,as seen from the cranial module, is slightly larger in the SewardPeninsula series than in either of the other groups; but the principaldifferences are seen in the face, which in the Seward Peninsula groupis perceptibly larger and especially higher than it is in either theIgloo or the Greenland series. The orbits also in the southerners arelarger and the nose is slightly higher.On the whole it may be said that the resemblance of the Igloo crania tothose of Greenland is closer than that to either or both of the seriesof Golovnin Bay and Sledge Island. This suggests the possibility that asimilar though not quite the same differentiation in the skull may havetaken place both in the Seward Peninsula and in the far north; thoughthe possibility of a derivation of any one of the three groups from anyof the others can not be discarded. So far as the skull is concerned adefinite solution of the identity of the Igloo material would have tobe, it would seem, postponed to the future.The used data on the Greenland Eskimo skulls agree closely with thoseof Fürst and Hansen (Crania Groenlandica, fol., 1915), and also withthe much fewer and scattered records of Virchow, Davis, Duckworth,Oetteking, Pittard, etc.,[201] on Eskimo skulls from Labrador._Stature and strength._--The bones of the skeleton of the Igloo seriesshow the people to have been of good height and of above medium Eskimorobustness. The principal measurements are given below, togetherwith the corresponding ones on the western and the Yukon Eskimo. Thematerial is not all that could be wished for, either in numbers orrepresentation, but it will suffice for rough comparisons. Regrettablynothing for comparison is available as yet from Greenland or otherparts of the far northeast where we meet with long, narrow, and highskulls.

above table shows some remarkable and interesting conditions.The first of the most apparent facts is that the type of the YukonEskimo stands well apart from both of the other series in a number ofessentials, showing that it is not very nearly related and that it maybe left out of consideration.On the other hand the long bones from the Seward Peninsula and thenorthwest coast, especially those of the males, show very closely tothose of the Igloo group. The male bones of the two series are almostidentical, except that the Igloo bones are somewhat stronger.Such close resemblances can hardly be fortuitous. They speak stronglyfor the basic identity of the old Igloo people with those of at leastparts of the Seward Peninsula and parts of the northwest coast. If wetake the bones from the Seward Peninsula alone (see p. 314) it is foundthat these resemblances still hold.The evidence thus shown constitutes a strong indication that the oldIgloo group may be inherently related to that part of the Eskimopopulation of Seward Peninsula which shows the long and narrow skull;but the data offer no light on the questions as to whether the Igloogroup may have been derived from that of the Seward Peninsula or viceversa, and on the true relation of either or both of these to theEskimo of Baffin Land, Greenland, and Labrador.To definitely decide the problem of the Igloo group there are neededdata on the long bones of the northeasterners; in the second place itis highly desirable to know how large and how ancient was the group ofthe narrow-headed people on the Seward Peninsula and Sledge Island; andin the third place it is important that the cultural history of the twogroups be known as thoroughly as possible. All of which are tasks forthe future.The possibility of a development of the Igloo cranial type on thenorthwest coast itself can not be denied, in view of the facts thatall its characteristics are within the ranges of normal individualvariations on that coast, and that similar developments have evidentlybeen realized elsewhere. But in such a case it would be logicalto expect, locally or not far away, some ancestry of the group,and the group would not probably be limited to a little spot and afew scores of persons. Had the group developed incidentally from aphysically exceptional family, it could not be expected to have beenanywhere nearly as uniform as the group under consideration. Thehigh degree of uniformity of the Igloo contingent speaks for a wellaccomplished differentiation; and as there is no other trace of thisin the conditions near Barrow, and there are no ruins denoting a longoccupation, the evidence is against a local development and for animmigration of the group. A coming of a small-sized contingent from theSeward Peninsula would be easy; its coming from Greenland or Labradoror Baffin Land would surely be difficult, but not impossible to theEskimo, who is known to have been a traveler.Whatever may be the eventual solution of the Igloo problem, it is plainthat the presence of that group near Barrow, together with the presenceof evidently closely related groups in a part of the Seward Peninsulaand again in the far east of the Eskimo region, offers much food forthought and investigation. The most plausible possibility would seemto be a relatively late (within the present millennium) coming of aphysically already well differentiated small group, from either thesouth or the east, with a relatively short settlement at the Barrowsite, some local multiplication in numbers, and then extinction partlythrough disease, partly perhaps through absorption into a stronger andnewer contingent derived from the western people.FOOTNOTES:[200] The measurements of this series have been published by thewriter in the first part of the Catalogue of Human Crania in the U.

To show this with a proper perspective it will berequisite to briefly review the previous ideas on these problems.ORIGIN OF THE NAME "ESKIMO"According to Charlevoix (Nouv. France, III, 178), the term "Eskimo"is a corruption of the Abenaki Indian Esquimantsic or the OjibwayAshkimeg, both terms meaning "those who eat raw flesh." In the wordsof Captain Hooper,[202] "Neither the origin nor meaning of the name'Esquimaux,' or Eskimo, as it is now spelled, is known. According toDoctor Rink, the name 'Esquimaux' was first given to the inhabitants ofSouthern Labrador as a term of derision by the inhabitants of NorthernLabrador, and means raw-fish eater. Dall says the appellation 'Eskimo'is derived from a word indicating a sorcerer or shaman in the languageof the northern tribes."For Brinton,[203] as for Charlevoix, the term "Eskimo" is derivedfrom the Algonkin "Eskimantick," "eaters of raw flesh." According toChamberlain,[204] Sir John Richardson (Arctic Searching Exp., p. 203)attempts to derive it from the French words ceux qui miaux (miaulent),referring to their clamorous outcries on the approach of a ship.Petitot (Chambers Encyc., Ed. 1880, IV, p. 165, article Esquimaux)says that at the present day the Crees, of Lake Athabasca, call themWis-Kimowok (from Wiyas flesh, aski raw, and mowew to eat), and alsoAyiskimiwok (i. e., those who act in secret). In Labrador the Englishsometimes call the Eskimo "Huskies" (loc. cit., p. ix. 7. ChambersEncyc., article Esquimaux. See Hind. Trav. in Int. of Labr., loc.cit., and Petitot loc. cit., p. ix.) and Suckemos (Richardson, ArcticSearching Expedition, p. 202) and Dall (Proc. Am. Ass. Adv. Sci., 1869,p. 266) says that in Alaska the Tinneh Indians call them "Uskeeme"(sorcerers).The Eskimo call themselves "Innuit," said to be the plural of in-nu,the man, hence "the people"; the same being as a rule the meaning ofthe name by which the various tribes of the Indian call themselves.On the Asiatic coast the Eskimo is known as the "Yuit," "Onkilon,""Chouklouks," or "Namollo"; while in the east appears the name"Karalit."None of this has thrown any light on the origin of the Eskimo.FOOTNOTES:[202] Hooper, C.

Among the earliest of these were thoseof missionaries, such as Crantz (1779), and of the early explorers,such as Steller, v. Wrangell, Lütke and others. They were based on thegeneral aspect of the Eskimo, particularly that of his physiognomy; andseeing that in many features he resembled most the mongoloid peoplesof Asia they attached him to these, which meant the conclusion that hewas of Asiatic derivation. Quite soon, however, there began to appearalso the opinions of students of man. The first of these was that ofBlumenbach, as expressed in his Inaugural Thesis of 1781. In thisthesis, more particularly its second edition, he classifies the Eskimoexpressly as a part of the Caucasian or white race. But after obtainingan Eskimo skull and an Eskimo body he changes his opinion and in1795-1806 he comes out with a definite classification of the Eskimo asa member of the Mongolians; and a similar conclusion, with its impliedor expressed consequence of a migration from Asia to America, has beenreached since, mainly on somatological but also in part on linguisticand cultural bases, by a large number of authors, including Lawrence,Morton, Pickering, Latham, Flower, Peschel, Topinard, Brinton, Virchow(1877), Quatrefages and Hamy (1882), Thalbitzer, Bogoras and numerousothers. With all of this, the conception of the Asiatic origin of theEskimo has not passed the status of a strong probability, lacking afinal conclusive demonstration.A chronological list of the more noteworthy individual statements isgiven at the end of this section._Origin in America._--Since the earlier parts of the nineteenth centurythe opinion began to be expressed that the Eskimo is not of Asiatic butof American origin. Already in 1847 Prichard tells us that there arethose who "consider them as belonging to the American family," and heplainly favors this conception.Between 1873 and 1890 the American origin of the Eskimo is repeatedlyasserted by Rink, who for 16 winters and 22 summers lived with theeastern Eskimo, first as a scientific explorer and later as royalinspector or governor of the southern Danish settlements in Greenland(preface by R. Brown to Rink's Tales and Traditions, 1875). In thisopinion, briefly, the Eskimo were derived from the inland Indian tribesof Alaska; without referring to the origin of the Indian.Rink's authoritative opinion was followed or paralleled by DanielWilson (1876), Grote, Krause, Ray, Keane, Brown, and others. In1887 Chamberlain expresses the somewhat startling additional theorythat it was not the Eskimo who was derived from the Mongolians butthe Mongolians from the Eskimo or their American ancestors. And in1901-1910 Boas comes to the conclusion that the Eskimo probablyoriginated from the inland tribes (Indian?) in the Hudson Bay region.An interesting case in these connections is that of Rudolf Virchow. In1877 (see details at the end of this section) he expresses the beliefin the Eskimo coming from Asia; in 1878 he seems to be uncertain;and in 1885 he comes out in support of the opinion that the originalhome of the Eskimo may have been in the western part of the HudsonBay region. Among later students of the problem, Steensby[205] andBirket-Smith[206] incline on cultural grounds to this hypothesis.Wissler, not explicit as to the Eskimo in 1917 (The American Indian),in 1918 (Archæology of the Polar Eskimo) finds, after Steensby, themost acceptable theory of the Eskimo origin to be that "they expandedfrom a parent group in the Arctic Archipelago"; but in 1922, in thesecond edition of his The American Indian, he repeats word for word hisopinion of 1917, which appears to favor an Asiatic derivation._Origin in Europe--Identity with Upper Palaeolithic man._--About thesixties of last century growing discoveries in France of implements,etc., of later palaeolithic man brought about a realization thatnot a few of these implements and other objects, particularly thoseof the Magdalenian period, resembled like implements and objectsof the Eskimo; from which, together with the considerations of thesimilarities of fauna (reindeer, musk-ox, etc.), and of climate,there was but a step to a more or less definite identification of theMagdalenians and Solutreans with the Eskimo. In 1870 Pruner-Bey[207]claims a similarity between Solutrean and Eskimo skulls. In 1883 theseviews received the influential support of De Mortillet (see details).In 1889 the theory receives strong support from the characteristicsof the Chancelade (Magdalenian) skeleton which Testut declares are inmany respects almost identical with those of the Eskimo. And withinthe next few years the notion is upheld by Hamy and Hervé. It remainssympathetic as late as 1913 to Marcellin Boule, and finds most recentchampions in Morin and Sollas.However, there were also many who opposed the effort at a directconnection of the upper palaeolithic man of Europe and the Eskimo.Among these were Geikie, Flower, Rae, Daniel Wilson, Robert Brown,Déchelette, Laloy. At present the theory is supported mainly by Morinand Sollas, opposed by Steensby, Burkitt, Keith, MacCurdy, and others;while most students of the Eskimo ignore the question._Other hypotheses._--Besides the preceding ideas which attribute theorigin of the Eskimo to Asia, or America, or old Europe, there werealso others that failed to receive a wider support; and there wereauthors and students who remained undecided or were too cautious todefinitely formulate their beliefs. Some of the former as well as thelatter deserve brief mention.Gallatin, in 1836, mainly on linguistic grounds, recognizes thefundamental relation of the Eskimo and the Indian and seems inclined tothe American origin of the former, but makes no clear statement to thateffect. For Meigs (1857), who probably followed an earlier opinion, theEskimo came "from the islands of the Polar Sea." C. C. Abbott (1876)saw Eskimo in the early inhabitants of the Delaware Valley. To Grote(1875, 1877), the Eskimo were "the existing representatives of theman of the American glacial epoch"; they were modified Pliocene men.Nordenskiöld (1885) follows closely Meigs and Grote; the Eskimo may be"the true autochthones of the Polar regions," having inhabited themfrom before the glacial age, during more genial climate. Keane (1886)believed the Eskimo developed from the Aleuts. For De Quatrefages(1887), man originated in the Tertiary in northern Asia, spread fromthere, and some of his contingents may have reached America and beenthe ancestors of the Eskimo; the western tribes of the latter being amixture of the Eskimo with Asiatic brachycephals.

They arenot descendants of the Skroellings of the opposite American coast, ashas already been seen. It is clear that they can not have come fromthe eastward, over the ocean which intervenes between Lapland andGreenland, for no Esquimaux traces have ever been found on Spitzbergen,Iceland, or Jan Mayen. We look at them and see at once that they haveno kinship with the red race of America; but a glance suffices toconvince us of their relationship with the northern tribes of Siberia.It is in Asia, then, that we must seek their origin."       *       *       *       *       *Whymper, 1869:[218] "That the coast natives of northern Alaska are butAmericanized Tchuktchis from Asia, I myself have no doubt."       *       *       *       *       *Peschel, 1876:[219] "The identity of their language with that of theNamollo, their skill on the sea, their domestication of the dog, theiruse of the sledge, the Mongolian type of their faces, their capabilityfor higher civilization, are sufficient reasons for answering thequestion, whether a migration took place from Asia to America orconversely from America to Asia, in favor of the former alternative;yet such a migration from Asia by way of Bering Strait must haveoccurred at a much later period than the first colonization of the NewWorld from the Old one * * *."It is not likely that the Eskimo spread from America to Asia, becauseof all Americans they have preserved the greatest resemblance inracial characters to the Mongolian nations of the Old World, andin historical times their migrations have always taken place in aneasterly direction."       *       *       *       *       *Kuhl, 1876:[220] "Bilden so die Eskimo in der Sprache das Bindegliedzwischen America und Asien, so ist dies noch viel mehr der Fall inBezug auf ihren Typus: dieser stimmt bei den Polarvölkern diesseits undjenseits der Beringsstrasse 'zum Verwechseln' überein, wie denn auchein beständiger Verkehr hinüber und herüber stattfindet. Hierin liegtder unwiderstehliche Beweis, dass diese Polarvölker wenigstens voneiner Herkunft sind und dass eine Einwanderung von einem Continente indas andere hier stattgefunden hat. Haben wir nun die Wahl, entweder dieEskimo aus Asien nach America, oder die Tschuktschen, die dort auf derAsiatischen Seite wohnen, aus America einwandern zu lassen--wofür sichauch Stimmen erhoben haben--so werden wir keinen Augenblick zweifelhaftsein: eine spätere Rückwanderung eines einzelnen Stammes in das Landder Väter wäre immerhin denkbar; aber wer über die Tschuktschen hinwegdie Sache in's Grosse sieht, kann für die Urzeit nur eine Einwanderungvon Asien nach America, nicht umgekehrt, annehmen, und hierfür findenwir ausser den allgemeinen Gründen, welche uns der Verlauf unsererUntersuchungen nahe gebracht, noch zwei besondere Beweise bei denEskimo: einmal können wir die Spur ihrer Wanderungen historischverfolgen, und diese wären nach Osten gerichtet, sodass sie Grönland,mit dem heute ihr Name so eng verbunden ist, zuletzt erreichten(S. 209); sodann haben die Eskimo allein unter den AmericanischenStämmen das Mongolische Gepräge ganz unversehrt bewahrt--dies bliebeunerklärlich, wenn sie Americanische Autochthonen wären * * * Einendeutlichen Hinweis auf die Urheimath Asien enthalten auch dieWanderungen der Stämme durch das Americanische Continent, soweit wirdieselben verfolgen können."       *       *       *       *       *Dall, 1877:[221] "I see, therefore, no reason for disputing thehypothesis that America was peopled from Asia originally, and thatthere were successive waves of emigration."The northern route was clearly by way of Bering Strait; * * *Linguistically, no ultimate distinction can be drawn between theAmerican Innuit and the American Indian. * * * I shall assume, whatis also assumed by Mr. Markham, that the original progenitors of theInnuit were in a very primitive, low, and barbarous condition. * * *"I assume, then, that the larger part of North America may have beenpeopled by way of Bering Strait. * * * I believe that this emigrationwas vastly more ancient than Mr. Markham supposes, and that it tookplace before the present characteristics of races and tribes of NorthAmerican savages were developed. * * *"My own impression agrees with that of Doctor Rink that the Innuitwere once inhabitants of the interior of America; that they wereforced to the west and north by the pressure of tribes of Indians fromthe south; that they spread into the Aleutian region and northwestcoast generally, and possibly simultaneously to the north; that theirjourneying was originally tentative, and that they finally settled inthose regions which afforded them subsistence, perhaps after passingthrough the greater portion of Arctic America, leaving their tracesas they went in many places unfit for permanent settlement; thatafter the more inviting regions were occupied, the pressure fromIndians and still unsatisfied tribes of their own stock, induced stillfurther emigration, and finally peopled Greenland and the shores ofnortheastern Siberia; but that these latter movements were, on thewhole, much more modern, and more local than the original exodus, andtook place after the race characteristics and language were tolerablywell matured. * * *"I conclude that at present the Asiatic Innuit range from Koliuchin Bayto the eastward and south to Anadyr Gulf. * * *"To the reflux of the great wave of emigration, which no doubt tookplace at a very early period, we may owe the numerous deserted hutsreported by all explorers on the north coasts of Asia, as far east asthe mouth of the Indigirka. At one time, I thought the migration toAsia had taken place within a few centuries, but subsequent study andreflection has convinced me that this could not have been the case.

He looked uponthe Eskimos as a branch of the North Asiatic Mongols (of which theJapanese may be taken as a familiar example), who in their wanderingacross the American continent in the eastward direction, isolatedalmost as perfectly as an island population would be, hemmed in onone side by the eternal polar ice, and on the other by hostile tribesof American Indians, with whom they rarely, if ever, mingled, havegradually developed special modifications of the Mongolian type, whichincrease in intensity from west to east, and are seen in their greatestperfection in the inhabitants of Greenland. * * *"Doctor Rae also thinks that the Eskimos came from across BeringStrait from Asia. Their traditions and many other things point in thatdirection, and they are in no way related to the ancient cave men ofEurope."       *       *       *       *       *Dawson, 1880:[224] Eskimo: "On the eastern side of the continent thesepoor people have always been separated by a marked line from theirIndian neighbors on the south, and have been regarded by them with themost bitter hostility. On the west, however, they pass into the EasternSiberians, on the one hand, and into the West-coast Indians, on theother, both by language and physical characters.

There all the conditions havebeen present for the originating of such a culture, and from thereit has spread eastward right to Greenland, seeking everywhere toadapt itself to the local geographical conditions. And it can hardlyhave been a culture wave alone; it must have been a migration. Thesimilarities between east and west are in many directions so detailedthat it is difficult to explain them without assuming an actualmigration of people from the one place to the other."       *       *       *       *       *Jochelson, 1928:[231] "In discussing the question of former Eskimooccupation of the Siberian Arctic coast a very remote period of time isnot meant, so that in this sense the assumed recent Eskimo migrationsfrom Asia into America and vice versa do not interfere with the generaltheory of the Asiatic origin of the American population."FOOTNOTES:[208] Steller, G.

All the American writers eminent fortheir researches in the glottology of the New World, among whom I shallmention Mr. du Ponceau and Mr. Gallatin, are unanimous in the opinionthat the Esquimaux belong to the same great department of nations asthe Hunting Tribes of North America."       *       *       *       *       *Rink, 1890:[233] "* * * kann es wohl keinem Zweifel unterworfen sein,dass die Eskimos den sogenannten Nordwest-Indianern an der KüsteAlaskas und weiter südwärts am nächsten stehen. Es dürfte deshalb derUntersuchung werth sein, ob sie nicht auch wirklich als das äusserstenördliche Glied dieser Völkerstämme zu betrachten wären. Man hatangenommen, dass diese letzteren, dem Laufe der Flüsse folgend, vomBinnenlande zur Küste gekommen sind. Sie lernten dann, theilweise undum so mehr wohl, je weiter nach Norden sich ihren Lebensunterhaltaus dem Meere zu verschaffen. Die Eskimos endigten damit, sichausschliesslich der Jagd auf dem Meere zu widmen, und erlangten dadurchihre merkwürdige Fähigkeit, allen Hindernissen des arktischen KlimasTrotz bieten zu können. Betrachten wir demnach, wie man vermeintlichnoch jetzt die Spuren der Veränderungen beobachten kann, denen sie nachund nach unterworfen worden sind, indem sie sich, unserer Vermuthungzufolge, nach Norden und Osten verbreiteten."Rink, 1873:[234] "As far as can now be judged, the Eskimo appearto have been the last wave of an aboriginal American race, whichhas spread over the continent from more genial regions, followingprincipally the rivers and watercourses, and continually yielding tothe pressure of the tribes behind them, until at last they have peopledthe seacoast. * * *"The author explains some of the most common traditions from Greenlandas simply mythical narrations of events occurring in the far northwestcorner of America, thereby pointing to the great probability of thatdistrict having been the original home of the nation, in which theyfirst assumed the peculiarities of their present culture."Captain Pim also expressed his belief that "the Eskimo were pureAmerican aborigines, and not of Asiatic descent."       *       *       *       *       *Rink, 1875:[235] "If we suppose the physical conditions and the climateof the Eskimo regions not to have altered in any remarkable way sincethey were first inhabited, their inhabitants of course must originallyhave come from more southern latitudes, * * * it appears evident onmany grounds that such a southern tribe has not been a coast peoplemigrating along the seashore, and turning into Eskimo on passing beyonda certain latitude, but that they have more probably emerged fromsome interior country, following the river banks toward the shores ofthe polar sea, having reached which they became a coast people, and,moreover, a polar-coast people. The Eskimo most evidently representingthe polar-coast people of North America, the first question whicharises seems to be whether their development can be conjectured withany probability to have taken place in that part of the world. Othergeographical conditions appear greatly to favor such a supposition ** *. The rivers taking their course to the sea between Alaska and theCoppermine River, seem well adapted to lead such a migrating peopleonward to the polar sea. * * *"The probable identity of the 'inlanders' with the Indians has alreadybeen remarked on. When the new coast people began to spread along theArctic shores, some bands of them may very probably have crossed BeringStrait and settled on the opposite shore, which is perhaps identicalwith the fabulous country of Akilinek. On the other hand, there is verylittle probability that a people can have moved from interior Asia tosettle on its polar seashore, at the same time turning Eskimo, andafterwards almost wholly emigrated to America."On comparing the Eskimo with the neighboring nations, their physicalcomplexion certainly seems to point at an Asiatic origin; but, as faras we know, the latest investigations have also shown a transitionallink to exist between the Eskimo and the other American nations, whichwould sufficiently indicate the possibility of a common origin from thesame continent."       *       *       *       *       *Rink, 1875:[236] "The author, who has traveled and resided in Greenlandfor 20 years, and has studied the native traditions, of which he haspreserved a collection, considers the Eskimo as deserving particularattention in regard to the question how America has been originallypeopled. He desires to draw the attention of ethnologists to thenecessity of explaining, by means of the mysterious early history ofthe Eskimo, the apparently abrupt step by which these people have beenchanged from probably inland or riverside inhabitants into a decidedlylittoral people, depending entirely on the products of the Arctic Sea;and he arrives at the conclusion that, although the question must stillremain doubtful, and dependent chiefly on further investigations intothe traditions of the natives occupying adjacent countries, yet, as faras can now be judged, the Eskimo appear to have been the last wave ofan aboriginal American race, which has spread over the continent frommore genial regions, following principally the rivers and watercourses,and continually yielding to the pressure of the tribes behind them,until at last they have peopled the seacoast. * * *"When we consider the existing intercourse between the inhabitants onboth sides of Bering Strait, we find many circumstances to justify theconclusion that those traditions of the Greenland Eskimo refer to theorigin of the Eskimo sledge dog from the training of the Arctic wolf,to the first journeys upon the frozen sea, and to intercourse betweenthe aboriginal Eskimo and the Asiatic coast."       *       *       *       *       *Rink, 1886:[237] "Grönland kann ja nur von Westen her seine eskimoischeBevölkerung empfangen haben. Dasselbe lässt sich mit Wahrscheinlichkeitauch von den nächsten Nachbarländern jenseits der Davisstrasseannehmen, und wenn wir diese Vermutung weiter erstrecken, gelangenwir zum Alaskaterritorium als der wahrscheinlichen Heimat der jetztso weit zertreuten arktischen Volkes. Zunächst findet diese Annahmeeine Bestätigung darin, dass die Eskimos hier nicht auf die Küstebeschränkt, sondern auch längs der Flüsse ins Binnenland verbreitetsind, nur dass der ungeheure Fischreichtum dieser Flüsse es möglichgemacht haben kann, dass hier ursprünglich eine noch viel grössereBevölkerung, als jetzt, sich sammelte, welche durch Auswanderungdas notwendige Kontingent zur Entstehung der auf die Meeresküstebeschränkten Stämme geliefert haben kann."       *       *       *       *       *Wilson, 1876:[238] "Some analogies confirm the probability of a portionof the North American stock having entered the continent from Asia byBering Strait or the Aleutian Islands; and more probably by the latterthan the former. * * *"In this direction, then, a North American germ of population may haveentered the continent from Asia, diffused itself over the Northwest,and ultimately reached the valleys of the Mississippi, and penetratedto southern latitudes by a route to the east of the Rocky Mountains.Many centuries may have intervened between the first immigrationand its coming in contact with races of the southern continent; andphilological and other evidence indicates that if such a northwesternimmigration be really demonstrable, it is one of very ancient date. Butso far as I have been able to study the evidence, much of that hithertoadduced appears to point the other way. * * *"With Asiatic Esquimaux thus distributed along the coast adjacent tothe dividing sea; and the islands of the whole Aleutian group in theoccupation of the same remarkable stock common to both hemispheres:The only clearly recognizable indications are those of a current ofmigration setting toward the continent of Asia, the full influence ofwhich may prove to have been more comprehensive than has hitherto beenimagined possible. * * *"       *       *       *       *       *Grote, 1877:[239] Regards the Eskimo as the original inhabitants ofNorth America and believes they extended down to 50° in the eastern and60° in the western part of the continent.       *       *       *       *       *Krause, 1883:[240] "Ueberblickt man nun die gegenwärtige Verbreitungder Eskimos in Asien, so wird man der Ansicht von Dall und Nordenskiöldbeistimmen, dass die asiatischen Eskimo aus Amerika eingewandertsind und nicht, wie Steller, Wrangell, und andere vermutheten,zurückgebliebene Reste einer ehemals zahlreicheren, nach Amerikahinübergezogenen Bevölkerung. Immerhin würde durch die Annahmeeines amerikanischen Ursprunges der jetzigen Eskimobevölkerung dieMöglichkeit früherer Wanderungen in entgegengesetzter Richtung nichtausgeschlossen sein, nur giebt die gegenwärtige Verbreitung keinenAnhalt für eine solche, und historische Beweise fählen."       *       *       *       *       *Ray, 1885:[241] "Of their origin and descent we could get no trace,there being no record of events kept among them. * * *"That they have followed the receding line of ice, which at one timecapped the northern part of this continent, along the easiest linesof travel is shown in the general distribution of a similar people,speaking a similar tongue, from Greenland to Bering Strait; in sodoing they followed the easiest natural lines of travel along thewatercourses and the seashore, and the distribution of the race to-daymarks the routes traveled. The seashore led them along the Labrador andGreenland coasts; Hudson Bay and its tributary waters carried its quotatowards Boothia Land; helped by Back's Great Fish River, the Mackenziecarried them to the northwestern coast, and down the Yukon they came topeople the shores of Norton Sound and along the coast to Cape Princeof Wales. They occupied some of the coast to the south of the mouth ofthe Yukon, and a few drifted across Bering Strait on the ice, and theirnatural traits are still in marked contrast with their neighbors, theChuckchee. They use dogs instead of deer, the natives of North Americahaving never domesticated the reindeer, take their living from thesea, and speak a different tongue. Had the migration come from Asia itdoes not stand to reason that they would have abandoned the deer uponcrossing the straits."       *       *       *       *       *Keane, 1886:[242] "Dr. H. Rink, in the current number of the DeutscheGeographische Blätter (Bermen, 1886) * * * makes it sufficientlyevident that their primeval home must be placed in the extremenorthwest, on the Alaskan shores of the Bering Sea * * * the AleutianIslanders, who are treated by Doctor Rink as a branch of the Eskimofamily, but whose language diverges profoundly from, or rather shows noperceptible affinity at all to, the Eskimo. The old question respectingthe ethnical affinities of the Aleutians is thus again raised, but notfurther discussed by our author. To say that they must be regarded as'ein abnormer Seitenzweig,' merely avoids the difficulty, while perhapsobscuring or misstating the true relations altogether. For theseislanders should possibly be regarded, not 'as abnormal offshoot,'but as the original stock from which the Eskimos themselves havediverged. * * * Doctor Rink himself advances some solid reasons forbringing the Eskimo, not from Asia at all, or at least not in the firstinstance, but from the interior of the North American continent. Heholds, in fact, with some other ethnologists, that they were originallyinlanders, who, under pressure from the American Indians, graduallyadvanced along the course of the Yukon, Mackenzie, and other greatrivers, to their present homes on the Bering Sea, and Frozen Ocean."No individual or decided standpoint on the question is taken in theauthor's Man, Past and Present, 1920 edition.       *       *       *       *       *Brown, 1881:[243] "The Eskimo are therefore an essentially Americanpeople, with a meridional range greater than that of any otherrace. * * *"It is also clear that this migration has always been from west toeast, as also has been that of the Indian tribes; * * *"Did these hyperboreans come from Asia or are they evolutions,differentiations, as it were, of some of the other American races?That all of the American peoples came originally from Asia, is, Ithink, an hypothesis for which a great deal might be said. Unless theyoriginated there or were autochthonic, an idea which may at once bedismissed; they could scarcely have come from anywhere else, * * * butthe central question is whether the Eskimo are of a later date than theIndians or are really Indians compelled to live under less favorableconditions than the rest of their kinsfolk. The latter will, I think,be found to be the most reasonable view to adopt. * * *"Doctor Rink seems not far from the truth when he indicates the riversof Central Arctic America as the region from whence the Eskimo spreadnorthward. * * *"It is not at all improbable that the original progenitors of the racemay have been a few isolated families, members of some small Indiantribe, or the decaying remnants of a larger one. Little by little theywere expelled from their hunting and fishing grounds on the originalriver bank until, finding no place amid the stronger tribes, theysettled in a region where they were left to themselves. * * *"It may, however, be taken as proved that the Eskimo are in no respectand never were a European people; that they are not and never were anAsiatic one, except to the small extent already described; that thehandful of people settled on the Siberian shore migrated from America,and that it is very probable the Eskimo came from the interior ofArctic America, Alaska more likely than from any other part of theworld."       *       *       *       *       *Virchow, 1877:[244] "Ich möchte namentlich darauf aufmerksam machen,dass diejenigen, welche den nächsten Anknüpfungspunkt für dieUrbevölkerung Amerika's bei den Eskimo's suchen, welche ferner dieSprache und die Formen der Eskimo's nach Asien hinein verfolgen,leicht ein petitio principii machen dürften, insofern als es wohl seinkönnte, dass sie ein späteres Phänomen für ein früheres halten. Warumsollte nicht die Einwanderung der Eskimo's von Asien erst erfolgt sein,nachdem längst andere Theile des Continents ihre Bewohner erhaltenhatten?"1878:[245] "Nun ist es sehr bemerkenswerth, dass gegenüber dieserphysiognomischen Aehnlichkeit der Eskimos und der Mongolen eineabsolute Differenze Zwischen ihnen in Bezug auf die Schädelkapselexistirt" (examined six living Greenland Eskimos).1885:[246] "Verbinden wir dieses mit dem Umstande, dass die Sagender Ungava-Eskimos stets nach Norden über die Hudson-Strasseverlegt werden, dass man im Baffin-Lande stets über die Fury- undHecla-Strasse fort nach Süden als dem Schauplatz alter Sagen hinweist,und dass die westlichen Eskimos ebenso den Osten als das Land ihrersagenhaften Helden und Stämme betrachten, so gewinnt die Vermuthung anWahrscheinlichkeit, dass im Westen des Hudson-Bay-Gebietes die Heimathder weitverbreiteten Stämme zu suchen ist."       *       *       *       *       *Chamberlain, 1889:[247] "In a paper read before the Institute lastyear (Proc. Can. Inst., 3d. ser., Vol. V., Fasc. i., October, 1887, p.70), I advanced the view that instead of the Eskimo being derived fromthe Mongolians of northeastern Asia, the latter are on the contrarydescended from the Eskimo, or their ancestors, who have from timeimmemorial inhabited the continent of America."       *       *       *       *       *Boas, 1901:[248] "All these data seem to me to prove conclusivelythat the culture of the Alaskan Eskimo is very greatly influenced bythat of the Indians of the North Pacific coast and by the Athapascantribes of the interior. This is in accord with the observation thattheir physical type is not so pronounced as the eastern Eskimo type. Ibelieve, therefore, that H. Rink's opinion of an Alaskan origin of theEskimo is not very probable. If pure type and culture may be consideredas significant, I should say that the Eskimo west and north of HudsonBay have retained their ancient characteristics more than any others.If their original home was in Alaska, we must add the hypothesis thattheir dispersion began before contact with the Indians. If their homewas east of the Mackenzie, the gradual dispersion and ensuing contactwith other tribes would account for all the observed phenomena. ** * On the whole, the relations of North Pacific and North Asiaticcultures are such that it seems plausible to my mind that the AlaskanEskimo are, comparatively speaking, recent intruders, and that they atone time interrupted an earlier cultural connection between the twocontinents."To which he adds in the second part of this work,[249] speaking of theEskimo taboos: "It may perhaps be venturesome to claim that the markeddevelopment of these customs suggests a time when the Eskimo tribeswere inland people who went down to the sea and gradually adoptedmaritime pursuits, which, however, were kept entirely apart from theirinland life, although in a way this seems an attractive hypothesis."Boas, 1910:[250] "There is little doubt that the Eskimos, whoselife as sea hunters has left a deep impression upon all of theirdoings, must probably be classed with the same group of peoples. Themuch-discussed theory of the Asiatic origin of the Eskimos must beentirely abandoned. The investigations of the Jesup North PacificExpedition, which it was my privilege to conduct, seem to show that theEskimos must be considered as, comparatively speaking, new arrivals inAlaska, which they reached coming from the east."       *       *       *       *       *Clark Wissler, 1917.[251] Page 363: "The New World received adetachment of early Mongoloid peoples at a time when the main body hadbarely developed stone polishing."Pages 361-362: "Our review of New World somatic characters revealedthe essential unity of the Indian population. It is also clear thatthere are affinities with the Mongoloid peoples of Asia. Hence, weare justified in assuming a common ancestral group for the wholeMongoloid-Red stream of humanity. We have already outlined the reasonsfor assuming the pristine home of this group to be in Asia."Page 335: "For example, the Eskimos, whose first appearance in the NewWorld must have been in Alaska, spread only along the Arctic coast beltto its ultimate limits."1918[252].

To what race did he belong?In solving this the zoological evidence is of great importance. Thereindeer and musk sheep now inhabit the northern part of the AmericanContinent and are the principal land animals that supply the Esquimauxwith food. The latter of these has departed from the Asiatic Continent,leaving remains behind to prove that it shared the higher northernlatitudes of Asia with the reindeer, and this latter has retreatedfarther and farther north during the historical period. May not therace that lived on these two animals in southern Gaul have shared alsoin their northern retreat, and may it not be living in company withthem still? The truth of such a hypothesis as this is found by anappeal to the weapons, implements, and habits of life of the Esquimaux.The fowling spear, the harpoon, the scrapers, the marrow spoons arethe same in the ice huts of Melville Sound as in the ancient dwellingsof southern Gaul. In both there is the same absence of pottery; inboth bones are crushed in the same way for the sake of the marrow,and accumulate in vast quantities. The very fact of human remainsbeing found among the relics of the feast is explained by an appeal towhat Captain Parry observed in the island of Igloolik. Among the vastquantities of bones of walruses and seals, and skulls of dogs and bearsfound in the Esquimaux camp, were numbers of human skulls lying aboutamong the rest, which the natives tumbled into the collecting bags ofthe officers without the least remorse. A similar carelessness for thedead was also observed by Sir J. Ross and Captain Lyon. This presence,then, of human remains in the south of Gaul is another link binding theancient people then living there to the Esquimaux. Their small sizealso is additional evidence."The only inference that can be drawn from these premises is that thepeople in question were decidedly Esquimaux, related to them preciselyin the same way as the reindeer and musk sheep of those days were tothose now living in the high North American latitudes. The sole pointof difference is the possession of the dog by the latter people, butin the vast lapse of time between the date of their sojourn in Europeand the present day the dog might very well have been adopted from someother superior race, or even reduced under the rule of man from somewild progenitor. By this discovery a new people is added to those whichformerly dwelt in Europe. The severity of the climate in southern Gaulis proved by the northern animals above mentioned. As it became warmermusk sheep, reindeer, and Esquimaux would retreat farther and farthernorth until they found a resting place on the American shore of thegreat Arctic Sea. Possibly in the case of the Esquimaux the immigrationof other and better-armed tribes might be a means of accelerating thismovement."       *       *       *       *       *Hamy, 1870:[255] "Il nous parait, comme à MM. de Quatrefages,Carter-Blake, Le Hon, etc., que les caractères anatomiques des racesde Furfooz et de Cro-Magnon doivent leur faire prendre place dans legroupe hyperboréen."       *       *       *       *       *Dawkins, 1874[256]: In 1866, Boyd Dawkins, on the basis of theresemblances between the implements of the Eskimo and those of thelater prehistoric man of Europe, advances the idea that the Eskimo wereclose kin to the palaeolithic man of Europe, before the scientificforum. In his Cave Hunting he says: "Palaeolithic man appeared inEurope with the arctic mammalia, lived in Europe along with them,and disappeared with them. And since his implements are of the samekind as those of the Eskimos, it may reasonably be concluded that heis represented at the present time by the Eskimos, for it is mostimprobable that the convergence of the ethnological and zoologicalevidence should be an accident."1880:[257] "The probable identity of the cave men with the Eskimos isconsiderably strengthened by a consideration of some of the animalsfound in the caves. * * *"All these points of connection between the cave men and the Eskimoscan, in my opinion, be explained only on the hypothesis that theybelong to the same race * * *."The cave man: "From the evidence brought forward in this chapter, thereis reason to believe that he is represented at the present time by theEskimos."       *       *       *       *       *Mortillet, 1889:[258] "Les Groënlandais, au point de vuepaléoethnologique, présentent un très grand intérêt.

The language does not extend in Asia beyond thattribe. That of their immediate neighbors, the "Reindeer," or "WanderingTchuktchi," is totally different and belongs to the Kouriak family."There does not seem to be any solid foundation for the opinion ofthose who would ascribe to the Eskimaux an origin different from thatof the other Indians of North America. The color and features areessentially the same; and the differences which may exist, particularlythat in stature, may be easily accounted for by the rigor of theclimate and partly, perhaps, by the nature of their food. The entiresimilarity of the structure and grammatical forms of their languagewith those of various Indian tribes, however different in theirvocabularies, which will hereafter be adverted to, affords an almostconclusive proof of their belonging to the same family of mankind."       *       *       *       *       *Richardson, 1852:[271] "The origin of the Eskimos has been muchdiscussed as being the pivot on which the inquiry into the originalpeopling of America has been made to turn. The question has been fairlyand ably stated by Doctor Latham in his recent work On the Varieties ofMan, to which I must refer the reader; and I shall merely remark thatthe Eskimos differ more in physical aspect from their nearest neighborsthan the red races do from one another. The lineaments have a decidedresemblance to the Tartar or Chinese countenance. On the other hand,their language is admitted by philologists to be similar to the otherNorth American tongues in its grammatical structure; so that, as DoctorLatham has forcibly stated, the dissociation of the Eskimos from theirneighboring nations on account of their physical dissimilarity is metby an argument for their mutual affinity, deduced from philologicalcoincidences."Meigs, 1857:[272] "A connected series of facts and arguments whichseem to indicate that the Eskimo are an exceedingly ancient people,whose dawn was probably ushered in by a temperate climate, but whosedissolution now approaches, amidst eternal ice and snow; that the earlymigrations of these people have been from the north southwards, fromthe islands of the Polar Sea to the continent and not from the mainlandto the islands; and that the present geographical area of the Eskimomay be regarded as a primary center of human distribution for theentire polar zone."       *       *       *       *       *Abbott, 1876:[273] "It is fair to presume that the first human beingsthat dwelt along the shores of the Delaware were really the same peopleas the present inhabitants of Arctic America."       *       *       *       *       *Grote, 1875:[274] Basing himself on certain biological reasonings, theauthor concludes "that the Eskimos are the existing representativesof the man of the American glacial epoch, just as the White Mountainbutterfly (_Oeneis semidea_) is the living representative of a colonyof the genus planted on the retiring of the ice from the valley of theWhite Mountains."In a later communication[275] the author expresses the opinion thatthe peopling of America "was effected during the Tertiary; that theice modified races of Pliocene man, existing in the north of Asia andAmerica, forced them southward, and then drew them back to the localitywhere they had undergone their original modification. * * *"During the process, then, which resulted in the race modificationof the Eskimos, their original numbers must have been decreased bythe slowly but ever increasing cold of the northern regions, untilexperience and physical adaptation combined brought them to a state ofcomparative stability as a race."       *       *       *       *       *Baron Nordenskiöld[276] thought that the Eskimo might probably bethe true "autochthones" of the polar regions, i. e., that they hadinhabited the same previous to the glacial age, at a period when aclimate prevailed here equal to that of northern Italy at present,as proved by the fossils found at Spitzbergen and Greenland. As itmight be assumed that man had existed even during the Tertiary period,there was a great deal in favor of the assumption that he had lived inthose parts which were most favorable to his existence. The questionwas one of the highest importance, as, if it could be proved that theEskimo descended from a race which inhabited the polar regions in thevery earliest times, we should be obliged to assume that there was anorthern (polar) as well as an Asiatic cradle of the human race, whichwould open up new fields of research, both to the philologist and theethnologist, and probably remnants of the culture and language of theoriginal race might be traced in the present polar inhabitants of bothEurope and Asia.       *       *       *       *       *Keane, 1886:[277] "The Aleutian Islanders, who are treated by DoctorRink as a branch of the Eskimo family, but whose language divergesprofoundly from, or rather shows no perceptible affinity at all to,the Eskimo. The old question respecting the ethnical affinitiesof the Aleutians is thus again raised, but not further discussedby our author. To say that they must be regarded as 'ein abnormerSeitenzweig,' merely avoids the difficulty, while perhaps obscuringor misstating the true relations altogether. For these islandersshould possibly be regarded, not as 'an abnormal offshoot,' but as theoriginal stock from which the Eskimo themselves have diverged."       *       *       *       *       *Quatrefages, 1887:[278] From migrations of Tertiary man: Men originatedin Tertiary in northern Asia; spread from here to Europe and overAsia; "D'autres aussi gagnèrent peut-être l'Amérique et ont pu êtreles ancêtres directs des Esquimaux,...

Other indications, however,seem to conflict with such a hypothesis, and render it more probablethat the race was originally a small one, which did not until acomparatively late period develop to the point at which we now find it,and spread over the countries which it at present inhabits."       *       *       *       *       *Tarenetzky, 1900:[280] "Die Frage ist bis jetzt noch nicht entschiedenund wird wahrscheinlich auch niemals definitiv entschieden werdenob die gegenwärtig die Nordostgrenze Asiens und die NordwestgrenzeAmerikas bewohnenden Polarvölker ursprünglich aus Asien nach Amerikaoder in umgekehrter Richtung zu ihren Wohnsitzen wanderten."       *       *       *       *       *De Nadaillac[281] believed that the Eskimo (with some other aboriginalAmericans), now savage and demoralized, have issued from races morecivilized and that they could raise themselves to the old social levelwere it not for their struggle with inexorable climate, famines, andlately also alcoholism.       *       *       *       *       *Jenness, 1928:[282] "We still believe that the Eskimos arefundamentally a single people; that they had their origin in a homelandnot yet determined; but we have learned that they reached their presentcondition through a series of complex changes and migrations, theoutlines of which we have hardly begun to decipher."FOOTNOTES:[270] Gallatin, Albert, A Synopsis of the Indian Tribes of NorthAmerica.

New York, 1928.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS INDICATED BY PRESENT DATAThe maze of thoughts on the origin of the Eskimo shows one factconclusively, which is that the necessary evidence on the subjecthas hitherto been insufficient. From whatever side the problem hasbeen approached, whether linguistically, culturally, from the studyof myths, or even somatologically, the materials were, it is plain,more or less inadequate and there was not enough for satisfactorycomparisons. The best contributions to Eskimo studies, from the oldestto the most recent, all accentuate the need for further research, andmore ample collections.Another point is that heterogeneous and wide apart as many of theopinions may seem, yet when the subject is looked upon with a largerperspective they may often perhaps be harmonized. Thus a belief in anAmerican origin of the Eskimo need not exclude that in the Asiaticderivation of his parental stock. Even in the case of the supposedEuropean derivation the Eskimo are understood to have reached Americathrough Asia; there is not one suggestion of any importance advocatingthe coming of the Eskimo over northwestern Europe and Iceland. Onlythe Meigs-Grote-Nordenskiöld theory of an ancient polar race and itsdescent southward appears now as beyond the bounds of what would be atleast partly justifiable.What is the contribution to the subject of the studies reported in thistreatise, with its relatively great amount of somatological material?The answer is not easy.Even the truly great and precious material at hand is not sufficient.There are important parts of the Arctic, such as the Hudson Bay region,Baffin Land, and the central region; several parts of the west coast,such as the inland waters of the Seward Peninsula and the Eskimoportions of the Selawik, Kobuk, Noatak, and Yukon Rivers; and aboveall the Eskimo part of northeastern Siberia, from which there areinsufficient or no collections. There is, moreover, especially in thiscountry, a great want of skeletal material from the non-Eskimo Siberiantribes, and also from the old European peoples that are of mostimportance for comparisons. It must be plain, therefore, that even atpresent no final deductions are possible. All that can be claimed forthe evidence here brought forth is that it clears, or tends to settle,certain secondary problems, and that it presents indications of valuefor the rest of the question.The secondary problems that may herewith be regarded as settled are asfollows:1. _Unity or plurality of the race._--The materials at hand giveno substantiation to the possibility of the Eskimo belonging tomore than one basic strain of people. They range in color from tanor light reddish-yellow to medium brown; in stature from decidedlyshort to above the general human medium; in head from brachycephalicand low to extremely dolichocephalic, high and keel shaped; in eyesfrom horizontal to decidedly mongoloid; in orbits from microsemeto hypermegaseme; in nose from fully mesorrhinic to extremelyleptorrhinic; in physiognomy from pure "Indian" to extreme "Eskimo."Yet all through there runs, both in the living and in the skeletalremains, so much of a basic identity that no separation into anydistinct original "races" is possible. At most it is permissible tospeak of a few prevalent types.2. _Relation._--The general basic prototype of the Eskimo, accordingto all evidence, is so closely akin to that of the Indian that thetwo can not be fully separated. They appear only as the thumb and thedigits of the same hand, some large old mother stock from which bothgradually differentiated. This appears to be an unavoidable conclusionfrom the present anthropological knowledge of the two peoples.The next unavoidable deduction is that the mother stock of boththe Eskimo and the Indian can only be identified with the greatyellow-brown stem of man, the home of which was in Asia, but the rootsof which, as has been discussed elsewhere, were probably in ancient(later paleolithic) Europe.[283] The latter fact may explain thecultural as well as somatological resemblances between the Eskimo,as well as the Indian (for the Indian, physically at least, hasmuch in common with the upper Aurignacians), and the upper glacialEuropean populations. But such an explanation can not in the lightof present knowledge legitimately be extended to the assumption thateither the Indian complex or the Eskimo originated as such in Europe;they could be at most but parts of the eventual more or less furtherdifferentiated Asiatic progeny of the upper paleolithic Europeans.3. _Mixture._--It has been assumed by Boas and others that the easternEskimo have become admixed with the eastern Indian and the western withthe Alaskan Indian, that the physical and especially craniologicaldifferences between the eastern and western Eskimo were due to sucha mixture, and that both extremes deviated from the type of the pureEskimo, who was to be found somewhere in the central Arctic. Theevidence of the present studies does not sustain such an assumption.As shown before[284] and is seen more clearly from the present data,the western Eskimo type is also present or approached in variouslocalities in the far north (part of Smith Sound, Southampton Island,part of the Hudson Bay coast, with probable spots in the central Arcticproper). There is no indication of any central region where the westernEskimo type would be much "purer" than elsewhere.Individual skulls and skeletons in the west, particularly in certainspots (especially on Seward Peninsula), show the same characteristicsas the most diverging skulls or skeletons in the farthest northeast.And both in the west and in the east the most pronounced Eskimocharacteristics exceed similar features in the Indian, indicatingindependent development. Such characteristics involve the stature(taller in the west, shorter in the east than that of the Indian);the size of the head (everywhere averaging higher in the Eskimo);dolichocephaly, height of the head, its keel shape (all more pronouncedin the eastern and now and then a western Eskimo than in any Indiangroup); the face, nose, orbits, and lower jaw; with the relativeproportions and other characteristics of the skeleton. All these pointto functional and other developments within the Eskimo groups and nonesuggest a large Indian admixture.It is well known that more or less blood mixture takes place amongall neighboring peoples where contact is possible, even if otherwisethere be much enmity. Such enmity, often in an extreme form, existedeverywhere it seems between the Eskimo and the Indian, as a result ofthe encroaching of the former on the latter; there are many statementsto that effect. Within historic times also there are no records of anyadoptions or intermarriages between the two peoples. Nevertheless wherecontact took place, as on the rivers and in the southwest as well asthe southeast of the Eskimo territory, some blood mixture, it wouldseem, must have developed. The Indian neighbors show it, and it wouldbe strange if it remained one-sided. But of a mixture extensive enoughto have materially modified the type of the Eskimo in whole largeregions, such as the entire Bering Sea and most of the far northeast,there is no evidence and little not only probability but evenpossibility. Nothing approaching such an extensive mixture is shown bythe near-by Indians; and it would be most exceptional in people of thisnature if a much greater proportion of the mixture was into the Eskimo.Finally, a mixture of diverse human types, unless very old, maybe expected to leave numerous physical signs of heterogeneity anddisturbance, none of which is shown by either the western or easternEskimo. Such groups as that of the St. Lawrence Island, or that ofGreenland, are among the most homogeneous human groups known. The rangeof variation of their characters is as a rule a strictly normal range,giving a uniform curve of distribution, which is not consistent withthe notion of any relatively recent material mixture.4. _The indications._--The indications of the data and observationspresented in this volume may be outlined as follows:The Eskimo throughout their territory are but one and the same broadstrain of people. This strain is fundamentally related to that (orthose) of the American Indian. It is also uncontestably related to theyellow-brown strains of Asia.In many respects, such as pigmentation, build of the body,physiognomy, large brain, fullness of forehead, fullness of thefronto-sphenotemporal region, largeness of face and lower jaw, heightof the nose, size and characteristics of the teeth,[285] smallness ofhands and feet, etc., the Eskimos are remarkably alike over their wholeterritory. They differ in details, such as stature, form of the head,and breadth of the nose. But the distribution of these differences isof much interest and probably significance. Higher statures, broaderheads, and broader noses are found especially in the west, the lattertwo particularly in the Bering Sea region; low group statures, narrowheads and narrow noses reach, with few exceptions, their extremesin the northeast. Between the two extremes, however, there is nointerruption, but a gradation, with here and there an irregularity.These conditions speak not of mixture but rather of adaptation anddifferentiation.They strongly suggest a moderate stream of people, rooted in Asia, offairly broad and but moderately high head, of a good medium stature,with a mesorrhinic nose (and hence probably originally not farnorthern), and with many other characteristics in common, reachingAmerica from northeasternmost Asia after the related Indians, spreadingalong the seacoasts as far as it could, not of choice, or choice alone,but mainly because of the blocking by the Indian of the roads towardthe south and through the interior; and gradually modifying physicallyin adaptation to the new conditions and necessities; to climate, newermodes of life, the demands of the kayak, and above all to the resultsof the increased demands on the masticatory organs.The narrowness, increased length and increased height of the Eskimoskull, without change in its size or other characteristics, may readilybe understood as compensatory adaptations, the development of which wasinitiated and furthered by the development and mechanical effects ofthe muscles of mastication.A similar conclusion has been reached in my former study on the centraland Smith Sound Eskimo (1910). It has been approached or reachedindependently by other students of the Eskimo, notably Fürst andHansen (1915) in their great work on the East Greenlanders. It is aconclusion of much biological importance for it involves not merely thedevelopment but also the eventual inheritance of new characters.Former authors, it was seen, have advanced the theories of an Americanorigin of the Eskimo. This could only mean that he developed fromthe American Indian. And such a development would imply physicaland hereditary changes at least as great as those indicated in thepreceding paragraphs, and in less time. A differentiation commencedwell back in Asia, geographically and chronologically, and advancing,to its present limits, in America would seem the more probable.An origin of the Eskimo in Europe, during the last glacial invasion,would not only push into the hazy far past the same changes as heredealt with, but it would at the same time fail to explain the physicaldifferences within the Eskimo group, and deny any substantial changesin him during the long time of his migration toward the Americannorthern coasts.[Illustration: FIGURE 29.--Probable movements of people fromnortheastern Asia to Alaska and in Alaska. (A. Hrdlička)]Absolute proofs of the origin of the Eskimo, as of that of the variousstrains of the Indians, are hardly to be expected. Such origins are sogradual and insidious that they would escape detection even if watchedfor while occurring; they are noticed only after sufficient differenceshave developed and become established, which takes generations. Thesolving of racial origins must depend on sound scientific induction.Such induction may not yet be fully possible in the case of the Eskimo.The evidence is not yet complete. But with the present and other mostrecent data there is enough on hand for substantial indications. Theevidence shows that barring some irregularities, due possibly to laterintrusions or refluxes, the farther east in the Eskimo territory theobserver proceeds the more highly differentiated and divergent theEskimo becomes, and there is a greater gap between him and his Indianneighbors, as well as other races. Proceeding from the east westward,conditions are reversed. In general the farther west we proceed theless exceptional on the whole the Eskimo becomes and the more heapproximates the Indian, particularly the Indian of Alaska and thenorthwest coast. As this can not, in the light of present evidence, beattributed alone to mixture, it is plain that if it were possible toproceed a few steps farther in this direction the differences betweenthe Eskimo and the Indian would fade out so that a distinction betweenthe two would become difficult if not impossible.The facts point, therefore, to an original identity of the sourcefrom which were derived the Indian, more particularly his latestbranches, and the Eskimo, and to the identification of this sourcewith the palaeo-Asiatic yellow-brown people of lower northern Asia.The differentiation of the Eskimo from this source must have proceededover a fairly long time, and probably started already it would seemon the northern coasts of Asia, where conditions were present capableof beginning to shape him into an Eskimo; to be carried on since inthe Bering Sea area and especially in the Seward Peninsula and farthernorthward and eastward. In a larger sense the cradle of the Eskimo,therefore, while starting probably in northeast Asia, covered inreality a much vaster region, extending from northern Asia and theBering Sea to the far American Arctic.FOOTNOTES:[283] Hrdlička, A., The Peopling of Asia.

Anthrop., VI, Nos. 2 and 4. 1923.SUMMARYWhat is the substance of the results of all these new observations andstudies on the western Eskimo, who is the main subject of this report?In large lines this may be outlined as follows:1. The western Eskimo occupied, uninterrupted by other people (savein a few spots by the Aleuts), the great stretch of the Alaskan coastfrom Prince William Sound and parts of the Unalaska Peninsula to PointBarrow, all the islands in the Bering Sea except the Aleutians andPribilovs, and the northern and western coasts of the Chukchi Peninsulain Asia.They extended some distance inland along the Kuskokwim and YukonRivers; along the interior lakes and rivers of the Seward Peninsula;along a part of the Selawik River, most (perhaps) of the Kobuk River,and apparently along the whole Noatak River, communicating over theland with the lower Colville Basin. But no traces of original Eskimosettlements have ever been found in the true Alaska inland or alongthose parts of the Alaska rivers that constitute the Indian territory.2. The present population is sparse, with many unpeopled intervals,and not highly fecund, but, except when epidemics strike, it nomore diminishes; children and young people are now much in evidence,hygienic and economic conditions have improved, and the people ingeneral are well advanced in civilization. Their condition and moraleare rather superior, in places very perceptibly so, to those of themajority of the Alaska Indians.3. Except where there has been more contact with whites, a largepercentage of these Eskimo are still full bloods. They are a sturdy,cheerful, and liberal yet shrewd lot. They intermarry and mix notinconsiderably among themselves (between villages). Some of the whitetraders have married Eskimo women and raised promising families.Where larger numbers of whites were or are in proximity clandestinemixture is apparent. The better educated show often decidedly goodmental, mechanical, business, and artistic abilities. In the isolatedlocalities, such as St. Lawrence Island, the people have apparentlyescaped the period of demoralization that so often attends the passingfrom the old to new conditions.Tuberculosis and venereal diseases are present but not prevalent;rachitis seems absent. The people show much endurance, but longevity asyet is not much in evidence. Alcoholism is almost nonexistent except onoccasions when drink is provided by whites.4. The region of the western Eskimo shows a former larger populationof the same people. This is attested by many "dead" villages and oldsites. And this population evidently goes back some centuries at least,for some of the remains are extensive and both their depth and theircontents give the impression of prolonged duration; though seeminglyall thus far seen could be comprised within the Christian era.5. No habitations or remains belonging to a distinct people (Indians)have thus far come to light anywhere within the territory of thewestern Eskimo; and no trace has as yet been found of anything humanthat could be attributed to greater antiquity than that of theEskimo. But the older beaches and banks where such remains might haveexisted have either been covered with storm-driven sands and are nowperpetually frozen, or they have been "cut" away and lost; and thereseems no hope for finding such remains in the interior away from thesea or streams, for such parts were never under recent geologicalconditions favorable for human habitation.6. The now known remains consist of the ruins of dwellings and ofaccumulated refuse, the two together forming occasionally markedelevated heaps or ridges. Some of these ridges are over 18 feet deep.They contain many archeological specimens of stone, ivory, wood, andbone. The ivory in the older layers is more or less "fossilized."The upper layers of such remains usually contain some articles ofwhite man's manufacture (copper, iron, beads); lower layers arewholly aboriginal. Indian artifacts occur in Eskimo sites only in theproximity of the Indian on the rivers.7. The prevalent or later culture shown by the remains is fairlyrich, of good to relatively rather high grade, and of considerableuniformity. There are numerous indications of extensive trade invarious articles, particularly those of the Kobuk "jade."8. On the Asiatic coast, in the northern parts of the Bering Sea, onthe Seward Peninsula, in the Kotzebue region and at Point Hope, thedeeper portions of the remains give examples of the higher and richer"fossil ivory culture." This is distinguished by many objects ofhigh-class workmanship, and by curvilinear to scroll designs. The artappears to have distinct affinities with, on one hand, deeper Asia,and on the other with the northwest coast of America and even farthersouth. It is not clearly separated from either the contemporaneousor the later Eskimo art, yet it is of a higher grade and delicacyand much distinctiveness. It is not yet known where this art beginsgeographically, what preceded it, whence it was derived, just how farit reached along the coasts, or even what was its main center. It seemsbest for the present to reserve to it the name of the "fossil ivoryart" (rather than Jenness's too limiting "Bering Sea culture"), and todefer all conclusions concerning it to the future.9. It seems justifiable, however, to point to the significance ofwhat is already known. This "fossil ivory art" especially, but alsothe general culture of the western Eskimo, are highly developed anddifferentiated cultures, denoting considerable cultural background,extended duration, and conditions generally favorable to industrialand artistic developments. It has, it is already ascertained, certainaffinities in Asia. If this art and the attending culture wereadvancing toward America, as seems most probable, then the question ofcultural influences and introductions from Asia to America will have tobe reopened.10. Due to the perpetually frozen ground and the consequent necessityof surface burials, the area of the western Eskimo was, until recently,relatively rich in skeletal remains lying on the surface. It is no moreso now, due to storms, beasts, missionaries, teachers, and scientificcollectors. But while only a scattering remains of the surfacematerial, there is much and that of special importance lying in theground, mostly self-buried or assimilated by the tundra. This material,which now and then is accompanied by interesting archeologicalspecimens, calls for prompt attention; it will help greatly in clearinglocal and other problems.Occasionally burials were made or dead bodies were left in old houses.These remains, too, may prove of special value.11. Observations on both the living and the skeletal remains inthe western Eskimo area, supplemented by those on the northernand northeastern Eskimo, are now ample enough to justify certaingeneralizations. These are:_a._ Barring the Aleuts, who are Indian, the Eskimo throughout belongsomatologically to but one family, and this family appears as aremarkably pure racial unit, somewhat admixed in the south with theAleut, on the western rivers with the Indian, and in the east and a fewspots elsewhere with recent white people._b._ Within this family there is observable a considerable cranialchange, with moderate differences in nasal breadth, stature, and color,but the general characteristics of the physiognomy, and of the body andthe skeleton, remain remarkably similar._c._ The changes in the skull affect mainly the vault, which, indimensions, ranges through all the intermediary grades from moderatelybroad, short, and moderately high to pronouncedly narrow, long, andhigh, and in form from moderately convex over the top to markedly keelshaped.The distribution of skull form is somewhat irregular, but in generalthe broader and shorter heads predominate in the Asiatic and thesouthwestern and midwestern American portions of the Eskimo region,while the longest and narrowest heads are those of parts of the SewardPeninsula, and especially those from an isolated old settlement nearBarrow with those of Greenland (exclusive of the Smith Sound), BaffinLand, and, judging from other data, also eastern Labrador. More or lesstransitional forms are found between the two extremes, without therebeing anywhere a clear line of demarcation.The breadth of the nose, too, averages highest in the Asiatic, BeringSea, and the more southern Eskimo of the Alaska coast, the least alongthe northern Arctic coast and in the northeast. The stature is highestalong the western Alaska rivers and parts of the coast, least inGreenland and Labrador.The skin, while differing within but moderate limits, is apparentlylightest along parts (at least) of the northern Arctic.12. The whole distribution of the physical characteristics among theEskimo strongly suggests gradual changes--within the family itself;and as the long, narrow, high skull with keeled dome, occurring ina few limited localities in the west but principally in southernGreenland and neighboring territories, appears to be the farthest limitof the differentiation which finds no parallel in the neighboringor other peoples, while the form found in northeastern Asia, theBering Sea, and southwestern Alaska is near to those of varioussurrounding peoples, the inevitable resulting deduction is that, inthe light of our present knowledge, the origin of the Eskimo is tobe looked for in the western rather than the northern Arctic or thenortheastern area, and that particularly in the northern Bering Seaand the adjacent, particularly perhaps the northern, Asiatic region.The author is, therefore, led to regard the area between 160° west and160° east longitude and 60° to 75° north latitude as containing theprimal Eskimo-genic center, and as the source of the oldest Eskimoor proto-Eskimo extensions, while the larger part of the Eskimodifferentiations is in all probability American.13. The earlier notions relating to the western Eskimo, namely, thosethat would attribute his physical characteristics to a large admixturewith the Indian, are now untenable for the following reasons:_a._ The distribution of the western Eskimo traits and measurementsdoes not indicate any important heterogeneous mixture._b._ The groups most distant from the Indians, such as the St. Lawrenceor Diomede islanders and the Asiatic Eskimo, show very nearly the samesomatological characteristics as the rest of the southwestern andmidwestern groups._c._ Among the western Eskimo there are no data, no traditions, and nolinguistic or cultural evidence of any considerable Indian admixture._d._ The western contingents of the family do not represent a physicalresultant or means of the more narrow and long-headed type with theneighboring Indians of Alaska (or elsewhere in the north), but theyequal or even exceed the Indians in the principal features of theskull, face, and in other particulars.14. The nearest physical relatives of the Eskimo are evidently someof the Chukchi, with probably some other north Asiatic groups; theirnearest basic relatives in general are, according to many indications,the American Indians. The two families, Indian and Eskimo, appearmuch, it may be repeated, like the thumb and fingers of one and thesame hand, the hand being the large, original palaeo-Asiatic source ofboth. But the Eskimo are evidently a younger, smaller and still a moreuniform member; which speaks strongly for their later origin, migrationand internal differentiation.15. With his numbers, purity of blood, approachability, presentfacilities of language, many of the young speaking good English, andother favorable conditions, the Eskimo offers to anthropology one ofits best opportunities for a thorough study of an important humangroup, adapted to highly exceptional natural conditions. His food,mode of life, the climate, and isolation, give promise of interestingconditions of the internal organs, perhaps even blood, and ofphysiological as well as chemical and pathological peculiarities. Thisopportunity, together with the excellent and important opportunitiesfor archeology in the Bering Sea and neighboring regions, should beutilized to the possible limit within the present generation, for thewestern Eskimo, on one hand, is rapidly becoming civilized, changinghis food, clothing, housing, and habits; is also becoming more mixedwith whites; and is most assiduously exploiting the archeological sitesin his region for the sake of the income that comes to him from theever-rising demand for beads, etc., and from "fossil" ivory.BIBLIOGRAPHY  ABBES, H.

Ray’s “Map of  Explorations in Northwestern Alaska,”  Signal Service, U.S.A. 1885  Completed by  John Murdoch]ETHNOLOGICAL RESULTS OF THE POINT BARROW EXPEDITION.By John Murdoch.INTRODUCTION.The International Polar Expedition to Point Barrow, Alaska, wasorganized in 1881 by the Chief Signal Officer of the Army, for thepurpose of cooperating in the work of circumpolar observation proposedby the International Polar Conference. The expedition, which wascommanded by Lieut. P. H. Ray, Eighth Infantry, U.S. Army, sailed fromSan Francisco July 18, 1881, and reached Cape Smyth, 11 milessouthwest of Point Barrow, on September 8 of the same year. Here apermanent station was established, where the party remained untilAugust 28, 1883, when the station was abandoned, and the party sailedfor San Francisco, arriving there October 7.Though the main object of the expedition was the prosecution of theobservations in terrestrial magnetism and meteorology, it was possibleto obtain a large collection of articles illustrating the arts andindustries of the Eskimo of the region, with whom the most friendlyrelations were early established. Nearly all of the collection wasmade by barter, the natives bringing their weapons, clothing, andother objects to the station for sale. Full notes on the habits andcustoms of the Eskimo also were collected by the different members ofthe party, especially by the commanding officer; the interpreter,Capt. E. P. Herendeen; the surgeon, Dr. George Scott Oldmixon, andmyself, who served as one of the naturalists and observers of theexpedition. It fell to my share to take charge of and catalogue allthe collections made by the expedition, and therefore I had especiallyfavorable opportunities for becoming acquainted with the ethnographyof the region. Consequently, upon the return of the expedition, whenit was found that the ethnological observations would occupy too muchspace for publication in the official report,[N1] all the collectionsand notes were intrusted to me for the purpose of preparing a specialreport. The Smithsonian Institution, through the kindness of the lateProf. Spencer F. Baird, then secretary, furnished a room where thework of studying the collection could be carried on, and allowed meaccess to its libraries and to the extensive collections of theNational Museum for the purposes of comparison. The Director of theBureau of Ethnology, Maj. J. W. Powell, kindly agreed to furnish theillustrations for the work and to publish it as part of his annualreport, while the Chief Signal Officer, with the greatestconsideration, permitted me to remain in the employ of his Bureauuntil the completion of the work.    [Footnote N1: Report of the International Polar Expedition to    Point Barrow, Alaska, by Lieut. P. H. Ray, Washington, 1885.]Two years were spent in a detailed analytical study of the articles inthe collection, until all the information that could be gathered fromthe objects themselves and from the notes of the collectors had beenrecorded. Careful comparisons were made with the arts and industriesof the Eskimo race as illustrated by the collections in the NationalMuseum and the writings of various explorers, and these frequentlyresulted in the elucidation of obscure points in the history of thePoint Barrow Eskimo. In the form in which it is presented this workcontains, it is believed, all that is known at the present day of theethnography of this interesting people.Much linguistic material was also collected, which I hope some time tobe able to prepare for publication.The observations are arranged according to the plan proposed by Prof.Otis T. Mason in his “Ethnological Directions, etc.,” somewhatmodified to suit the circumstances. In writing Eskimo words thealphabet given in Powell’s “Introduction to the Study of IndianLanguages” has been used, with the addition _ɐ_ for an obscure _a_(like the final _a_ in _soda_), _ǝ_ for a similar obscure _e_, and _ö_for the sound of the German _ö_ or French _eu_.I desire to express my gratitude to the late Prof. Spencer F. Baird,Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, to the late Gen. WilliamB. Hazen, Chief Signal Officer of the Army, and to Maj. J. W. Powell,Director of the Bureau of Ethnology, for their kindness in enabling meto carry on these investigations. Grateful acknowledgment is due forvaluable assistance to various members of the scientific staff of theNational Museum, especially to the curator of ethnology, Prof. OtisT. Mason, and to Mr. William H. Dall. Valuable suggestions werereceived from Mr. Lucien M. Turner, Dr. Franz Boas, the late Dr. EmilBessels, and Dr. H. Rink, of Christiania.LIST OF WORKS CONSULTED.The following list is not intended for a complete bibliography of whathas been written on the ethnography of the Eskimo, but it is believedthat it contains most of the important works by authors who havetreated of these people from personal observation. Such of the lessimportant works have been included as contain any references bearingupon the subject of the study.As it has been my object to go, whenever possible, to the originalsources of information, compilations, whether scientific or popular,have not been referred to or included in this list, which alsocontains only the editions referred to in the text.ARMSTRONG, ALEXANDER.

Small contributions to the collectionwere obtained from natives of Wainwright Inlet and from people of theInland River (Nunatañmiun) who visited the northern villages.Nuwŭk, “the Point,” is situated on a slightly elevated knoll at theextremity of Point Barrow, in lat. 71° 23´ N., long. 156° 17´ W., andUtkiavwĭñ, “the Cliffs,” at the beginning of the high land at CapeSmyth, 11 miles southwest from Nuwŭk. The name Utkiavwĭñ was explainedas meaning “the high place, whence one can look out,” and was said tobe equivalent to ĭkpĭk, a cliff. This name appears on the various mapsof this region under several corrupted forms, due to carelessness orinability to catch the finer distinctions of sound. It first appearson Capt. Maguire’s map[N2] as “Ot-ki-a-wing,” a form of the word verynear the Eskimo pronunciation. On Dr. Simpson’s map[N3] it is changedto “Ot-ke-a-vik,” which on the admiralty chart is misprinted“Otkiovik.” Petroff on his map[N4] calls it “Ootiwakh,” while he givesan imaginary village “Ootkaiowik, Arctic Ocean,” of 55 inhabitants, inhis census of the Arctic Division (op. cit., p. 4), which does notappear upon his map.    [Footnote N2: Parl. Reports, 1854, vol. 42, p. 186.]    [Footnote N3: Further Papers, &c., Parl. Rep. (1855).]    [Footnote N4: Report on the population, etc., of Alaska.]Our party, I regret to say, is responsible for the name “Ooglaamie” or“Uglaamie,” which has appeared on many maps since our return. Strictlyspeaking this name should be used only as the official name of theUnited States signal station. It arose from a misunderstanding of thename as heard the day after we arrived, and was even adopted by thenatives in talking with us. It was not until the second year that welearned the correct form of the word, which has been carefullyverified.The inhabitants of these two villages are so widely separated fromtheir neighbors--the nearest permanent villages are at Point Belcherand Wainwright Inlet, 75 miles southwest, and Demarcation Point, 350miles east[N5]--and so closely connected with each other byintermarriage and common interests, that they may be considered as asingle people. In their hunting and trading expeditions theyhabitually range from the neighborhood of Refuge Inlet along the coastto Barter Island, going inland to the upper waters of the large riverswhich flow northward into the Arctic Ocean east of Point Barrow. Smallparties occasionally travel as far as Wainwright Inlet and more rarelyto Point Hope, and some times as far as the Mackenzie River. Theextent of their wanderings will be treated of more fully in connectionwith their relations to the other natives of the Northwest. Theyappear to be unacquainted with the interior except for about 100 milessouth of Point Barrow.    [Footnote N5: Capt. E. E. Smith, who in command of a steam whaler    penetrated as far east as Return Reef in the summer of 1885, says    that the natives told him there was no permanent village west of    Herschel Island.]The coast from Refuge Inlet runs nearly straight in a generallynortheast direction to Point Barrow, and consists of steep banks ofclay, gravel, and pebbles, in appearance closely resembling glacialdrift, bordered by a narrow, steep beach of pebbles and gravel, andbroken at intervals by steep gulleys which are the channels oftemporary streams running only during the period of melting snow, andby long, narrow, and shallow lagoons, to whose edges the cliffs slopegradually down, sometimes ending in low, steep banks. The mouths ofthese lagoons are generally rather wide, and closed by a bar of gravelthrown up by the waves during the season of open water. In the spring,the snow and ice on the land melt months before the sea opens andflood the ice on the lagoons, which also melts gradually around theedges until there is a sufficient head of water in the lagoon to breakthrough the bar at the lowest point. This stream soon cuts itself achannel, usually about 20 or 30 yards wide, through which the lagoonis rapidly drained, soon cutting out an open space of greater or lessextent in the sea ice. Before the sea opens the lagoon is drained downto its level, and the tide ebbs and flows through the channel, whichis usually from knee-deep to waist-deep, so that the lagoon becomesmore or less brackish. When the sea gets sufficiently open for wavesto break upon the beach, they in a short time bring in enough gravelto close the outlet. The cliffs gradually decrease in height till theyreach Cape Smyth, where they are about 25 feet high, and terminate inlow knolls sloping down to the banks of the broad lagoon Isûtkwɐ,which is made by the confluence of two narrow, sinuous gulleys, and isonly 10 feet deep in the deepest part.Rising from the beach beyond the mouth of this lagoon is a slightelevation, 12 feet above the sea level, which was anciently the siteof a small village, called by the same name as the lagoon. On thiselevation was situated the United States signal station of Ooglaamie.Beyond this the land is level with the top of the beach, which isbroad and nearly flat, raised into a slight ridge on the outer edge.About half a mile from the station, just at the edge of the beach, isthe small lagoon Imérnyɐ, about 200 yards in diameter, and nearlyfilled up with marsh. From this point the land slopes down to ElsonBay, a shallow body of water inclosed by the sandspit which formsPoint Barrow. This is a continuation of the line of the beach, varyingin breadth from 200 to 600 yards and running northeast for 5 miles,then turning sharply to the east-southeast and running out in a narrowgravel spit, 2 miles long, which is continued eastward by a chain ofnarrow, low, sandy islands, which extend as far as Point Tangent. Atthe angle of the point the land is slightly elevated into irregularturf-covered knolls, on which the village of Nuwŭk is situated. Atvarious points along the beach are heaps of gravel, sometimes 5 or 6feet in height, which are raised by the ice. Masses of old ice,bearing large quantities of gravel, are pushed up on the beach duringsevere storms and melt rapidly in the summer, depositing their load ofgravel and pebbles in a heap. These masses are often pushed up out ofreach of the waves, so that the heaps of gravel are left thenceforthundisturbed.Between Imernyɐ and Elson Bay (Tă´syûk) is a series of large shallowlagoons, nearly circular and close to the beach, which rises in aregular sea-wall. All have low steep banks on the land side, borderedwith a narrow beach. The first of these, I´kpĭlĭñ (“that which hashigh banks”), breaks out in the spring through a narrow channel in thebeach in the manner already described, and is salt or brackish. Thenext is fresh and connected with I´kpĭlĭñ by a small stream runningalong behind the beach. It is called Sĭ´n-nyû, and receives a rivuletfrom a small fresh-water lake 3 or 4 miles inland. The third, Imê´kpûñ(“great water”), is also fresh, and has neither tributary nor outlet.The fourth, Imêkpû´niglu, is brackish, and empties into Elson Bay by asmall stream. Between this stream and the beach is a littlefresh-water pond close to the bend of Elson Bay, which is calledKĭkyûktă´ktoro, from one or two little islands (kĭkyû´ktɐ) near oneend of it.Back from the shore the land is but slightly elevated, and is marshyand interspersed with many small lakes and ponds, sometimes connectedby inconsiderable streams. This marsh passes gradually into a somewhathigher and drier rolling plain, stretching back inland from the cliffsand growing gradually higher to the south. Dr. Simpson, on theauthority of the Point Barrow natives, describes the country as“uniformly low, and full of small lakes or pools of fresh water to adistance of about 50 miles from the north shore, where the surfacebecomes undulating and hilly, and, farther south, mountainous.”[N6]This description has been substantially verified by Lieut. Ray’sexplorations. South of the usual deer-hunting ground of the natives hefound the land decidedly broken and hilly, and rising gradually to aconsiderable range of mountains, running approximately east and west,which could be seen from the farthest point he reached.[N7]    [Footnote N6: Arctic papers, p. 233.]    [Footnote N7: Report U.S. International Polar Expedition to Point    Barrow, p. 28.]The natives also speak of high rocky land “a long way off to theeast,” which some of them have visited for the purpose of hunting themountain sheep. The low rolling plain in the immediate vicinity ofPoint Barrow, which is all of the country that could be visited by ourparty when the land was clear of snow, presents the general appearanceof a country overspread with glacial drift. The landscape isstrikingly like the rolling drift hills of Cape Cod, and thisresemblance is increased by the absence of trees and the occurrence ofponds in all the depressions. There are no rocks in situ visible inthis region, and large bowlders are absent, while pebbles larger thanthe fist are rare. The surface of the ground is covered with a thinsoil, supporting a rather sparse vegetation of grass, floweringplants, creeping willows, and mosses, which is thicker on the higherhillsides and forms a layer of turf about a foot thick. Large tractsof comparatively level ground are almost bare of grass, and consist ofirregular hummocks of black, muddy soil, scantily covered withlight-colored lichens and full of small pools. The lowlands,especially those back of the beach lagoons, are marshes, thicklycovered with grass and sphagnum. The whole surface of the land isexceedingly wet in summer, except the higher knolls and hillsides, andfor about 100 yards back from the edge of the cliffs. The thawing,however, extends down only about a foot or eighteen inches. Beyondthis depth the ground is perpetually frozen for an unknown distance.There are no streams of any importance in the immediate neighborhoodof Point Barrow. On the other hand, three of the rivers emptying intothe Arctic Ocean between Point Barrow and the Colville, which Dr.Simpson speaks of as “small and hardly known except to persons whohave visited them,”[N8] have been found to be considerable streams.Two of these were visited by Lieut. Ray in his exploring trips in 1882and 1883. The first, Kua´ru, is reached after traveling about 50 milesfrom Point Barrow in a southerly direction. It has been traced onlyfor a small part of its course, and there is reason to believe, fromwhat the natives say, that it is a tributary of the second namedriver. Lieut. Ray visited the upper part of the second river, Kulugrua(named by him “Meade River”), in March, 1882, when he went out to jointhe native deer hunters encamped on its banks, just on the edge of thehilly country. On his return he visited what the natives assured himwas the mouth of this river, and obtained observations for itsgeographical position. Early in April, 1883, he again visited theupper portion of the stream, and traced it back some distance into thehilly country. The intermediate portion has never been surveyed. Atthe time of each of his visits the river was, of course, frozen andthe ground covered with snow, but he was able to see that the riverwas of considerable size, upwards of 200 yards wide where he firstreached it, about 60 miles from its mouth, and showing evidences of alarge volume of water in the spring. It receives several tributaries.(See maps, Pls. I and II.)    [Footnote N8: Op. cit., p. 235.]The third river is known only by hearsay from the natives. It iscalled Ĭ´kpĭkpûñ (Great Cliff), and is about 40 miles (estimated fromday’s journeys) east of Kulu´grua. It is described as being a largerand more rapid stream than the other two, and so deep that it does notfreeze down to the bottom on the shallow bars, as they say Kulu´gruadoes. Not far from its mouth it is said to receive a tributary fromthe east flowing out of a great lake of fresh water, called Tă´syûkpûñ(Great Lake.) This lake is separated from the sea by a comparativelynarrow strip of land, and is so large that a man standing on thenorthern shore can not see the “very high” land on the southern. Ittakes an umiak a day to travel the length of the lake under sail witha fair wind, and when the Nunatañmiun coming from the south first sawthe lake they said “Taxaio!” (the sea).On Capt. Maguire’s map[N9] this lake is laid down by the name“Taso´kpoh” “from native report.” It is represented as lying betweenSmith Bay and Harrison Bay, and connected with each by a stream.Maguire seems to have heard nothing of Ikpikpûñ. This lake is notmentioned in the body of the report. Dr. Simpson, however,[N10] speaksof it in the following words: “They [i.e., the trading parties whenthey reach Smith Bay] enter a river which conducts them to a lake, orrather series of lakes, and descend another stream which joins the seain Harrison Bay.” They are well acquainted with the Colville River,which in their intercourse with us they usually called “the river atNĭ´galĕk,” Nĭ´galĕk being the well known name of the trading camp atthe mouth. It was also sometimes spoken of as the “river of theNunatañmiun.” The Mackenzie River is known as “Kupûñ” (great river).We found them also acquainted with the large unexplored river called“Kok” on the maps, which flows into Wainwright Inlet. They called it“Ku” (the river). The river “Cogrua,” which is laid down on the chartsas emptying into Peard Bay, was never mentioned by the Point Barrownatives, but we were informed by Capt. Gifford, of the whaler _DanielWebster_, who traveled along the coast from Point Barrow to CapeLisburne after the loss of his vessel in 1881, that it is quite aconsiderable stream. He had to ascend it for about a day’s journey--20miles, according to Capt. Hooper[N11]--before he found it shallowenough to ford.    [Footnote N9: Parl. Rop., 1854, vol. 42, opp. p. 186.]    [Footnote N10: Op. cit., p. 265.]    [Footnote N11: Corwin Report, p. 72.]CLIMATE.The climate of this region is thoroughly arctic in character, the meanannual temperature being 8° F., ranging from 65° to -52° F. Suchtemperatures as the last mentioned are, however, rare, the ordinarywinter temperature being between -20° and -30° F., rarely risingduring December, January, February, and March as high as zero, andstill more rarely passing beyond it. The winter merges insensibly byslow degrees into summer, with occasional “cold snaps,” and frostynights begin again by the 1st of September.The sun is entirely below the horizon at Point Barrow for 72 days inthe winter, beginning November 15, though visible by refraction a dayor two later at the beginning of this period and a day or two earlierat the end. The midday darkness is never complete even at the wintersolstice, as the sun is such a short distance below the horizon, butthe time suitable for outdoor employments is limited to a shorttwilight from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. There is, of course, an equal time inthe summer when the sun is continually above the horizon, and forabout a month before and after this period the twilight is so brightall night that no stars are visible.The snowfall during the winter is comparatively small. There isprobably not more than a foot of snow on a level anywhere on the land,though it is extremely difficult to measure or estimate, as it is sofine and dry that it is easily moved by the wind and is constantly inmotion, forming deep, heavy, hard drifts under all the banks, whilemany exposed places, especially the top of the sand beach, are sweptentirely clean. The snow begins to soften and melt about the firstweek in April, but goes off very slowly, so that the ground is notwholly bare before the middle or end of June. The grass, however,begins to turn green early in June, and a few flowers are seen inblossom as early as June 7 or 8.Rain begins to fall as early as April, but cold, snowy days are notuncommon later than that date. There is a good deal of clear, calmweather during the winter, and extremely low temperatures are seldomaccompanied by high wind. Violent storms are not uncommon, however,especially in November, during the latter part of January, and inFebruary. One gale from the south and southwest, which occurredJanuary 22, 1882, reached a velocity of 100 miles an hour. The mostagreeable season of the year is between the middle of May and the endof July, when the sea opens. After this there is much foggy and cloudyweather.Fresh-water ponds begin to freeze about the last week in September,and by the first or second week in October everything is sufficientlyfrozen for the natives to travel with sledges to fish through the iceof the inland rivers. Melting begins with the thawing of the snow, butthe larger ponds are not clear of ice till the middle or end of July.The sea in most seasons is permanently closed by freezing and themoving in of heavy ice fields from about the middle of October to theend of July. The heavy ice in ordinary seasons does not move very farfrom the shore, while the sea is more or less encumbered with floatingmasses all summer. These usually ground on a bar which runs from theSeahorse Islands along the shore parallel to it and about 1,000 yardsdistant, forming a “barrier” or “land-floe” of high, broken hummocks,inshore of which the sea freezes over smooth and undisturbed by thepressure of the outer pack.Sometimes, however, the heavy pack, under the pressure of violent andlong-continued westerly winds, pushes across the bar and is forced upon the beach. The ice sometimes comes in with great rapidity. Thenatives informed us that a year or two before the station wasestablished the heavy ice came in against the village cliffs, tearingaway part of the bank and destroying a house on the edge of the cliffso suddenly that one of the inmates, a large, stout man, was unable toescape through the trap-door and was crushed to death. Outside of theland-floe the ice is a broken pack, consisting of hummocks offragmentary old and new ice, interspersed with comparatively levelfields of the former. During the early part of the winter this pack ismost of the time in motion, sometimes moving northeastward with theprevailing current and grinding along the edge of the barrier,sometimes moving off to sea before an offshore wind, leaving “leads”of open water, which in calm weather are immediately covered with newice (at the rate of 6 inches in 24 hours), and again coming in withgreater or less violence against the edges of this new ice, crushingand crumpling it up against the barrier. Portions of the land-floeeven float off and move away with the pack at this season.The westerly gales of the later winter, however, bring in greatquantities of ice, which, pressing against the land-floe, are pushedup into hummocks and ground firmly in deeper water, thus increasingthe breadth of the fixed land-floe until the line of separationbetween the land-floe and the moving pack is 4 or 5 or sometimes even8 miles from land. The hummocks of the land-floe show a tendency toarrange themselves in lines parallel to the shore, and if the pressurehas not been too great there are often fields of ice of the season notover 4 feet thick between the ranges of hummocks, as was the case inthe winter of 1881-’82. In the following year, however, the pressurewas so great that there were no such fields, and even the level iceinside of the barrier was crushed into hummocks in many places.After the gales are over there is generally less motion in the pack,until about the middle of April, when easterly winds usually causeleads to open at the edge of the land-floe. These leads now continueto open and shut, varying in size with the direction and force of thewind. As the season advances, especially in July, the melting of theice on the surface loosens portions of the land-floe, which float offand join the pack, bringing the leads nearer to the shore. In themeantime the level shore ice has been cut away from the beach by thewarm water running down from the land and has grown “rotten” and fullof holes from the heat of the sun. By the time the outside ice hasmoved away so as to leave only the floes grounded on the bar theinside ice breaks up into loose masses, moving up and down with windand current and ready to move off through the first break in thebarrier. Portions of the remaining barrier gradually break off and atlast the whole finally floats and moves out with the pack, sometimes,as in 1881--a very remarkable season--moving out of sight from theland.This final departure of the ice may take place at any time between themiddle of July and the middle of August. East of Point Barrow we hadopportunities only for hasty and superficial observations of the stateof the ice. The land floe appears to form some distance outside of thesandy islands, and from the account of the natives there is much openwater along shore early in the season, caused by the breaking up ofthe rivers. Dr. Simpson[N12] learned from the natives that the tradingparties which left the Point about the 1st of July found open water atDease Inlet. This is more definite information than we were able toobtain. We only learned that they counted on finding open water a fewdays’ journey east.    [Footnote N12: Op. cit., p. 264.]THE PEOPLE.PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS.In stature these people are of a medium height, robust and muscular,“inclining rather to spareness than corpulence,”[N13] though thefullness of the face and the thick fur clothing often gives theimpression of the latter. There is, however, considerable individualvariation among them in this respect. The women are as a rule shorterthan the men, occasionally almost dwarfish, though some women aretaller than many of the men. The tallest man observed measured 5 feet9½ inches, and the shortest 4 feet 11 inches. The tallest woman was 5feet 3 inches in height, and the shortest 4 feet ½ inch. The heaviestman weighed 204 pounds and the lightest 126 pounds. One woman weighed192 pounds and the shortest woman was also the lightest, weighing only100 pounds.[N14] The hands and feet are small and well shaped, thoughthe former soon become distorted and roughened by work. We did notobserve the peculiar breadth of hands noticed by Dr. Simpson, nor isthe shortness of the thumb which he mentions sufficient to attractattention.[N15] Their feet are so small that only one of our party,who is much below the ordinary size, was able to wear the boots madeby the natives for themselves. Small and delicate hands and feetappear to be a universal characteristic of the Eskimo race and havebeen mentioned by most observers from Greenland to Alaska.[N16]    [Footnote N13: Simpson, op. cit., p. 238.]    [Footnote N14: See Report of Point Barrow Expedition, p. 50, for a    table of measurements of a number of individuals selected at    random from the natives of both villages and their visitors.]    [Footnote N15: Op. cit., p. 238.]    [Footnote N16: Davis (1586) speaks of the “small, slender hands    and feet” of the Greenlanders. Hakluyt’s Voyages, etc. (1589),    p. 782.    “Their hands and feet are little and soft.” Crantz, vol. 1, p. 133    (Greenland).    Hands and feet “extremely diminutive,” Parry 1st Voy., p. 282    (Baffin Land).    “Their hands and feet are small and well formed.” Kumlien    Contrib., p. 15 (Cumberland Gulf).    “Feet extraordinarily small.” Ellis, Voyage, etc., p. 132 (Hudson    Strait).    Franklin (1st Exp., vol. 2, p. 180) mentions the small hands and    feet of the two old Eskimo that he met at the Bloody Fall of the    Coppermine River.    “. . . boots purchased on the coast were seldom large enough for    our people.” Richardson Searching Exp., i, p. 344 (Cape Bathurst).    “Their hands and feet are small.” Petroff, Report, etc., p. 134    (Kuskoquim River).    Chappell (Hudson Bay, pp. 59, 60) has a remarkable theory to    account for the smallness of the extremities among the people of    Hudson Strait. He believes that “the same intense cold which    restricts vegetation to the form of creeping shrubs has also its    effect upon the growth of mankind, preventing the extremities from    attaining their due proportion”!]  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Unalina, a man of Nuwŭk.]The features of these people have been described by Dr. Simpson,[N17]and are distinctively Eskimo in type, as will be seen by comparing theaccompanying portraits (Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4, from photographs byLieut. Ray) with the many pictures brought from the eastern Arcticregions by various explorers, some of which might easily pass forportraits of persons of our acquaintance at Point Barrow.[N18]    [Footnote N17: Op. cit., p. 238.]    [Footnote N18: One young man at Point Barrow looks remarkably like    the well known “Eskimo Joe,” as I remember him in Boston in the    winter of 1862-’63.]  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Mûmûñina, a woman of Nuwŭk.]The face is broad, flat, and round, with high cheek bones and ratherlow forehead, broad across the brow and narrowing above, while thehead is somewhat pointed toward the crown. The peculiar shape of thehead is somewhat masked by the way of wearing the hair, and is bestseen in the skull. The nose is short, with little or no bridge (fewEskimo were able to wear our spring eye-glasses), and broad,especially across the alæ nasæ, with a peculiar rounded, somewhatbulbous tip, and large nostrils. The eyes are horizontal,[N19] withrather full lids, and are but slightly sunken below the level of theface.  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Akabiana, a youth of Utkiavwiñ.]The mouth is large and the lips full, especially the under one. Theteeth are naturally large, and in youth are white and generallyregular, but by middle age they are generally worn down toflat-crowned stumps, as is usual among the Eskimo. The color of theskin is a light yellowish brown, with often considerable ruddy coloron the cheeks and lips. There appears to be much natural variation inthe complexion, some women being nearly as fair as Europeans, whileother individuals seem to have naturally a coppery color.[N20] In mostcases the complexion appears darker than it really is from the effectsof exposure to the weather. All sunburn very easily, especially in thespring when there is a strong reflection from the snow.    [Footnote N19: The expression of obliquity in the eyes, mentioned    by Dr. Simpson (op. cit., p. 239), seems to me to have arisen from    the shape of the cheek bones. I may be mistaken, however, as no    careful comparisons were made on the spot.]    [Footnote N20: Frobisher says of the people of Baffin Land: “Their    colour is not much unlike the sunburnt countrie man.” Hakluyt’s    Voyages, etc. (1589), p. 627.]  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Puka, a young man of Utkiavwiñ.]The old are much wrinkled, and they frequently suffer from wateryeyes, with large sacks under them, which begin to form at acomparatively early age. There is considerable variation in features,as well as complexion, among them, even in cases where there seems tobe no suspicion of mixed blood. There were several men among them withdecided aquiline noses and something of a Hebrew cast of countenance.The eyes are of various shades of dark brown--two pairs of light hazeleyes were observed--and are often handsome. The hair is black,perfectly straight, and very thick. With the men it is generallycoarser than with the women, who sometimes have very long and silkyhair, though it generally does not reach much below the shoulders. Theeyebrows are thin and the beard scanty, growing mostly upon the upperlip and chin, and seldom appearing under the age of 20. In this theyresemble most Eskimo. Back,[N21] however, speaks of the “luxuriantbeards and flowing mustaches” of the Eskimo of the Great Fish River.Some of the older men have rather heavy black mustaches, but there ismuch variation in this respect. The upper part of the body (as much iscommonly exposed in the house) is remarkably free from hair. Thegeneral expression is good humored and attractive.    [Footnote N21: Journey, etc., p. 289.]The males, even when very young, are remarkable for their graceful anddignified carriage. The body is held erect, with the shoulders squareand chest well thrown out, the knees straight, and the feet firmlyplanted on the ground. In walking they move with long swinging elasticstrides, the toes well turned out and the arms swinging.I can not agree with Dr. Simpson that the turning out of the toesgives “a certain peculiarity to their gait difficult todescribe.”[N22] I should say that they walked like well built athleticwhite men. The women, on the other hand, although possessing goodphysiques, are singularly ungraceful in their movements. They walk ata sort of shuffling half-trot, with the toes turned in, the bodyleaning forward, and the arms hanging awkwardly.[N23]    [Footnote N22: Op. cit., p. 238.]    [Footnote N23: Cf. Simpson, op. cit., p. 240.]  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Woman stretching skins.]A noticeable thing about the women is the remarkable flexibility ofthe body and limbs, and the great length of time they can stand in astooping posture. (See Fig. 5 for a posture often assumed in working.)Both men and women have a very fair share of muscular strength. Someof the women, especially, showed a power of carrying heavy loadssuperior to most white men. We were able to make no other comparisonsof their strength with ours. Their power of endurance is very great,and both sexes are capable of making long distances on foot. Two mensometimes spend 24 hours tramping through the rough ice in search ofseals, and we knew of instances where small parties made journeys of50 or 75 miles on foot without stopping to sleep.The women are not prolific. Although all the adults are or have beenmarried, many of them are childless, and few have more than twochildren. One woman was known to have at least four, butinvestigations of this sort were rendered extremely difficult by theuniversal custom of adoption. Dr. Simpson heard of a “rare case” whereone woman had borne seven children.[N24] We heard of no twins ateither village, though we obtained the Eskimo word for twins. It wasimpossible to learn with certainty the age at which the women firstbear children, from the impossibility of learning the age of anyindividuals in the absence of any fixed method of reckoning time. Dr.Simpson states that they do not commonly bear children before the ageof 20,[N25] and we certainly saw no mothers who appeared younger thanthis. We knew of but five cases of pregnancy in the two villagesduring the 2 years of our stay. Of these, one suffered miscarriage,and of the other four, only two of the infants lived more than a shorttime. It is exceedingly difficult, for the reasons stated above, toform any estimate of the age to which these people live, though it isnatural to suppose that the arduous and often precarious existencewhich they lead must prevent any great longevity. Men and women whoappeared to be 60 or over were rare. Yûksĭ´ña, the so-called “chief”of Nuwŭk, who was old enough to be a man of considerable influence atthe time the _Plover_ wintered at Point Barrow (1852-’54), was in 1881a feeble, bowed, tottering old man, very deaf and almost blind, butwith his mental faculties apparently unimpaired. Gray hair appearsuncommon. Even the oldest are, as a rule, but slightly gray.    [Footnote N24: Op. cit., p. 254.]    [Footnote N25: Op. cit. p. 254.]PATHOLOGY.Diseases of the respiratory and digestive organs are the most frequentand serious ailments from which they suffer. The former are mostprevalent toward the end of summer and early in winter, and are due tothe natives sleeping on the damp ground and to their extremecarelessness in exposing themselves to drafts of wind when overheated.Nearly everyone suffers from coughs and colds in the latter part ofAugust, and many deaths occur at this season and the beginning ofwinter from a disease which appears to be pneumonia. A few cases, onefatal, of hemorrhage of the lungs were observed, which were probablyaggravated by the universal habit of inhaling tobacco smoke. Thepeople suffer from diarrhea, indigestion, and especially fromconstipation.Gonorrhea appears common in both sexes, but syphilis seems to beunknown in spite of the promiscuous intercourse of the women with thewhalemen. One case of uterine hemorrhage was observed. Cutaneousdiseases are rare. A severe ulcer on the leg, of long standing, wascured by our surgeon, to whose observations I am chiefly indebted forwhat I have to say about the diseases of these people; and one man hadlost the cartilage of his nose and was marked all over the body withhideous scars from what appeared to be some form of scrofulousdisease. A single case of tumor on the deltoid muscle was observed.Rheumatism is rather frequent. All are subject to snow blindness inthe spring, and sores on the face from neglected frost bites arecommon. Many are blind in one eye from what appears to be cataract orleucoma, but only one case of complete blindness was noticed. Dr.Sutherland states that he does not recollect a single instance oftotal blindness among the Eskimo that he saw in Baffin Land, andexpresses the opinion that “An individual in such a state would bequite unfit for the life of toil and hardship to which the hardyEsquimaux is exposed. The neglect consequent upon this helplesscondition most probably cuts off its afflicted objects.”[N26]    [Footnote N26: Journ. Ethnol. Soc., vol. 4, p. 206.]This seems quite reasonable on a priori grounds, but nevertheless theblind man at Cape Smyth had lived to middle age in very comfortablecircumstances, and though supported to a great extent by his relativeshe was nevertheless able to do a certain share of work, and had thereputation of being a good paddler for a whaling umiak.Injuries are rare. One man had lost both feet at the ankle and movedabout with great ease and rapidity on his knees. All are subject tobleeding at the nose and usually plug the bleeding nostril with abunch of deer hair.[N27]    [Footnote N27: Compare what Davis wrote in 1586 of the    Greenlanders: “These people are much given to bleed, and,    therefore, stoppe theyr noses with deere hayre or the hayre of an    elan.” Hakluyt, Voyages, etc., 1589, p. 782.]This habit, as it has been termed, of vicarious hemorrhage seems to becharacteristic of the Eskimo race wherever they have been met with,and has been supposed to be a process of nature for relieving thefullness of the circulatory system caused by their exclusively animaldiet.[N28]    [Footnote N28: Egede, Greenland, p. 120; Crantz, vol. 1, p. 234    (Greenland); Southerland. Journ. Ethnol. Soc., vol. IV, p. 207    (Baffin Land); Chappell, “Hudson Bay,” p. 74 (North Shore of    Hudson Strait); Lyon, Journal, p. 18 (Hudson Strait); Franklin,    1st Exp., I, p. 29 (Hudson Strait); Parry, 2d Voy., p. 544    (Igluilik); Hooper, Tents of the Tuski, p. 185 (Plover Bay,    Siberia).]Natural deformities and abnormalities of structure are uncommon,except strabismus, which is common and often, at least, congenital.One boy in Utkiavwĭñ had his forehead twisted to one side, probablyfrom some accident or difficulty during delivery. His intelligence didnot seem to be impaired. The people are, as a rule, right handed, butthat left-handed persons occasionally occur is shown by their having aword for a left-handed man. We also collected a “crooked knife,”fitted for use with the left hand.[N29]    [Footnote N29: I have an indistinct recollection of having once    seen a left-handed person from Nuwŭk.]PSYCHICAL CHARACTERISTICS.As a rule they are quick-witted and intelligent, and show a greatcapacity for appreciating and learning useful things, especiallymechanical arts. In disposition they are light-hearted and cheerful,not easily cast down by sorrow or misfortune, and though sometimesquick-tempered, their anger seldom lasts long.[N30] They have a verykeen sense of humor, and are fond of practical jokes, which they takein good part, even when practiced on themselves. They are generallypeaceable. We did not witness a single quarrel among the men duringthe two years of our stay, though they told us stories of fatalquarrels in former years, in which firearms were used. Liquor may havebeen the cause of these fights, as it is said to have been of the onlysuicide I ever heard of among them, which I am informed by Capt. E. E.Smith, the whaling master already referred to, occurred in 1885 atNuwŭk. Disagreements between man and wife, however, sometimes lead toblows, in which the man does not always get the best of it.    [Footnote N30: Holm calls the East Greenlanders “et meget livligt    Folkefærd” Geogr. Tidskrift, vol. 8, p. 96.]When the station was first established many of the natives beganpilfering from our stores, but they soon learned that by so doing theycut themselves off from the privilege of visiting the station andenjoying the opportunity for trading which it afforded, and were gladto promise to refrain from the practice. This promise was very wellobserved, though I think wholly from feelings of self-interest, as thethieves when detected seemed to have no feeling of shame. Some,I believe, never yielded to the temptation. There was seldom anydifficulty in obtaining restitution of stolen articles, as the thief’scomrades would not attempt to shield him, but often voluntarilybetrayed him. They acknowledged that there was considerable thievingon board of the ships, but the men of Utkiavwĭñ tried to lay the blameon the Nuwŭk people, and we may suppose that the charge wasreciprocated, as was the case regarding the theft of the _Plover’s_sails.[N31] We also heard of occasional thefts among themselves,especially of seals left on the ice or venison buried in the snow, butmen who were said to be thieves did not appear to lose any socialconsideration.    [Footnote N31: Simpson, op. cit., p. 248.]Robbery with violence appears to be unknown. We never saw or heard ofthe “burglar-alarm” described by Dr. Simpson,[N32] which I am inclinedto believe was really a “demon trap” like that described by Lieut. Ray(see below, under Religion).    [Footnote N32: Op. cit., p. 247.]They are in the main truthful, though a detected lie is hardlyconsidered more than a good joke, and considerable trickery ispracticed in trading. For instance, soon after the station wasestablished they brought over the carcass of a dog, with the skin,head, feet, and tail removed, and attempted to sell it for a youngreindeer; and when we began to purchase seal-oil for the lamps onewoman brought over a tin can nearly filled with ice, with merely alayer of oil on top.Clothing and other articles made especially for sale to us were oftenvery carelessly and hastily made, while their own things were alwayscarefully finished.[N33]    [Footnote N33: Compare Nordenskiöld’s experience in Siberia. The    “Chukches” sold him skinned foxes with the head and feet cut off    for hares, (Vega, vol. 1, p. 448), young ivory gulls for    ptarmigan, and a dog’s skull for a seal’s (vol. 2, p. 137).    Besides, “While their own things were always made with the    greatest care, all that they did especially for us was done with    extreme carelessness” (ibid). The Eskimos at Hotham Inlet also    tried to sell Capt. Beechey fishskins sewed together to represent    fish. (Voyage, p. 285.)]Their affection for each other, especially for their children, isstrong, though they make little show of grief for bereavement, andtheir minds are easily diverted by amusements. I am inclined tobelieve, however, from some cases I have observed, that grief isdeeper and more permanent than superficial appearances would indicate.Their curiosity is unbounded, and they have no hesitation ingratifying it by unlimited questioning. All who have read the accountsof the Eskimo character given by explorers in other parts of theArctic regions will recognize this as a familiar trait. We also foundthe habit of begging at first quite as offensive among some of thesepeople as other travelers have found it, but as they grew betteracquainted with us they ceased to beg except for trifling things, suchas a chew of tobacco or a match. Some of the better class never beggedat all. Some of them seemed to feel truly grateful for the benefitsand gifts received, and endeavored by their general behavior, as wellas in more substantial ways, to make some adequate return. Othersappeared to think only of what they might receive.Hospitality is a universal virtue. Many of them, from the beginning ofour acquaintance with them, showed the greatest friendliness andwillingness to assist us in every way, while others, especially ifthere were many of them together, were inclined to be insolent, andknives were occasionally drawn in sudden fits of passion. These“roughs,” however, soon learned that behavior of this sort waspunished by prompt ostracism and threats of severer discipline, andbefore the first nine months were past we had established the mostfriendly relations with the whole village at Cape Smyth. Some of thosewho were at first most insolent became afterwards our best friends.Living as these people do at peace with their neighbors, they wouldnot be expected to exhibit the fierce martial courage of many othersavages, but bold whalemen and venturous ice-hunters can not be saidto lack bravery.In their dealings with white men the richer and more influential amongthem at least consider themselves their equals if not their superiors,and they do not appreciate the attitude of arrogant superiorityadopted by many white men in their intercourse with so-called savages.Many of them show a grace of manner and a natural delicacy andpoliteness which is quite surprising. I have known a young Eskimo sopolite that in conversing with Lieut. Ray he would take pains tomispronounce his words in the same way as the latter did, so as not tohurt his feelings by correcting him bluntly.[N34]    [Footnote N34: Compare Vega, vol. 1, p. 489. The Chukches were “so    courteous as not to correct but to adopt the mistakes in the    pronunciation or meaning of words that were made on the _Vega_.”]TRIBAL PHENOMENA.We were unable to discover among these people the slightest trace oftribal organization or of division into gentes, and in this ourobservations agree with those of all who have studied the Eskimoselsewhere. They call themselves as a race “In´uĭn,” a termcorresponding to the “Inuit” of other dialects, and meaning “people”,or “human beings”. Under this name they include white men and Indiansas well as Eskimo, as is the case in Greenland and the Mackenzie Riverdistrict, and probably also everywhere else, though many writers havesupposed it to be applied by them only to their own race.They have however special names for the former two races. The peopleof any village are known as “the inhabitants of such and such aplace;” for instance, Nuwŭ´ñmiun, “the inhabitants of the point;”Utkiavwĭñmiun, “the inhabitants of Utkiávwĭñ;” Kuñmiun (in Greenlandic“Kungmiut”), “the people who live on the river.” The people aboutNorton Sound speak of the northern Eskimo, especially those of PointBarrow and Cape Smyth, as “Kûñmû´dlĭñ,” which is not a name derivedfrom a location, but a sort of nickname, the meaning of which was notascertained. The Point Barrow natives do not call themselves by thisname, but apply it to those people whose winter village is atDemarcation Point (or Herschel Island, see above, p. 26). This wordappears in the corrupted form “Kokmullit,” as the name of the villageat Nuwŭk on Petroff’s map. Petroff derived his information regardingthe northern coast at second-hand from people who had obtained theirknowledge of names, etc., from the natives of Norton Sound.The people of the two villages under consideration frequently gobackward and forward, sometimes removing permanently from one villageto the other, while strangers from distant villages sometimes winterhere, so that it was not until the end of the second year, when wewere intimately acquainted with everybody at Utkiavwĭñ, that we couldform anything like a correct estimate of the population of thisvillage.[N35] This we found to be about 140 souls. As well as we couldjudge, there were about 150 or 160 at Nuwŭk. These figures show agreat decrease in numbers since the end of 1853, when Dr. Simpson[N36]reckoned the population of Nuwŭk at 309. During the 2 years fromSeptember, 1881, to August, 1883, there were fifteen deaths that weheard of in the village of Utkiavwĭñ alone, and only two children bornin that period survived. With this ratio between the number of birthsand deaths, even in a period of comparative plenty, it is difficult tosee how the race can escape speedy extinction, unless by accessionsfrom without, which in their isolated situation they are not likely toreceive.[N37]    [Footnote N35: See “Approximate Census, etc.,” Report of Point    Barrow Exp., p. 49.]    [Footnote N36: Op. cit., p. 237.]    [Footnote N37: Petroff’s estimate (Report, etc., p. 4) of the    number of natives on this part of the Arctic coast is much too    large. He gives the population of “Ootiwakh” (Utkiavwĭñ) as 225.    Refuge Inlet (where there is merely a summer camp of    Utkiavwĭñmiun), 40, and “Kokmullit,” 200. The supposed settlement    of 50 inhabitants at the Colville River is also a mere summer    camp, not existing in the winter.]SOCIAL SURROUNDINGS.CONTACT WITH UNCIVILIZED PEOPLE._Other Eskimo._--The nearest neighbors of these people, as has beenstated above, are the Eskimo living at Demarcation Point (or HerschelIsland), eastward, and those who inhabit the small villages betweenPoint Belcher and Wainwright Inlet. These villages are three innumber. The nearest to Point Belcher, Nuna´ria, is now deserted, andits inhabitants have established the new village of Sida´ru nearer theinlet. The third village consists of a few houses only, and is calledA´tûnĕ. The people of these villages are so closely connected thatthey are sometimes spoken of collectively as Sida´ruñmiun. At adistance up the river, which flows into Wainwright Inlet, live theKu´ñmiun, “the people who live on the river.” These appear to beclosely related to the people of the first village below WainwrightInlet, which is named Kĭlauwitawĭñ. At any rate, a party of them whocame to Cape Smyth in the spring of 1883 were spoken of indifferentlyas Kuñmiun or Kĭlauwitawĭ´ñmiun.Small parties from all the villages occasionally visit Point Barrowduring the winter for the purpose of trade and amusement, travelingwith sledges along the land ice where it is smooth, otherwise alongthe edge of the cliffs; and similar parties from the two northernvillages return these visits. No special article of trade appears tobe sought at either village, though perhaps the southern villages havea greater supply of skins of the bearded seal, fit for making umiakcovers, as I knew of a load of these brought up for sale, and in thespring of 1883 a party went down to the inlet in search of such skins.Single families and small parties like that from Kĭlauwitawĭñ,mentioned above, sometimes spend the whaling season at Point Barrow,joining some of the whaling crews at the northern villages. The peoplethat we saw from these settlements were very like the northern Eskimosbut many of them spoke a perceptibly harsher dialect, sounding thefinal consonants distinctly.The people at Point Hope are known as Tĭkera´ñmiun “inhabitants of theforefinger (Point Hope)”, and their settlement is occasionally visitedby straggling parties. No natives from Point Hope came north duringthe 2 years of our stay, but a party of them visited the _Plover_ in1853.[N38] We found some people acquainted by name with the Kuwû´ñmiunand Silawĭ´ñmiun of the Kuwûk (Kowak or “Putnam”) and Silawik Riversemptying into Hotham Inlet, and one man was familiar with the name ofSisualĭñ, the great trading camp at Kotzebue Sound. We were unable tofind that they had any knowledge of Asia (“Kokhlitnuna,”) or theSiberian Eskimo, but this was probably due to lack of properlydirected inquiries, as they seem to have been well informed on thesubject in the _Plover’s_ time.[N39]    [Footnote N38: Maguire, NW. Passage, p. 384.]    [Footnote N39: It is to be regretted that the expedition was not    supplied with a copy of Dr. Simpson’s excellent paper, as much    valuable information was missed for lack of suggestions as to the    direction of inquiries.]With the people of the Nu´natăk (Inland) River, the Nunatañmiun, theyare well acquainted, as they meet them every summer for purposes oftrading, and a family or two of Nunatañmiun sometimes spend the winterat the northern villages. One family wintered at Nuwŭk in 1881-’82,and another at Utkiavĭñ the following winter, while a widower of this“tribe” was also settled there for the same winter, having married awidow in the village. We obtained very little definite informationabout these people except that they came from the south and descendedthe Colville River. Our investigations were rendered difficult by theengrossing nature of the work of the station, and the trouble weexperienced, at first, in learning enough of the language to makeourselves clearly understood. Dr. Simpson was able to learn definitelythat the homes of these people are on the Nunatăk and that some ofthem visit Kotzebue Sound in the summer, while trading parties make aportage between the Nunatăk and Colville, descending the latter riverto the Arctic Ocean.[N40] I have been informed by the captain of oneof the American whalers that he has, in different seasons, met thesame people at Kotzebue Sound and the mouth of the Colville. We alsoreceived articles of Siberian tame reindeer skin from the east, whichmust have come across the country from Kotzebue Sound.    [Footnote N40: Op. cit., pp. 234 and 236.]These people differ from the northern natives in some habits, whichwill be described later, and speak a harsher dialect. We were informedthat in traveling east after passing the mouth of the Colville theycame to the Kûñmû´dlĭñ (“Kangmali enyuin” of Dr. Simpson and otherauthors) and still further off “a great distance” to the Kupûñ or“Great River”--the Mackenzie--near the mouth of which is the villageof the Kupûñmiun, whence it is but a short distance inland to the“great house” (iglu´kpûk) of the white men on the great river(probably Fort Macpherson). Beyond this we only heard confused storiesof people without posteriors and of sledges that run by themselveswithout dogs to draw them. We heard nothing of the country ofKĭtiga´ru[N41] or of the stone-lamp country mentioned by Dr.Simpson.[N42] The Kûñmûdlĭñ are probably, as Dr. Simpson believes, thepeople whose winter houses were seen by Franklin at DemarcationPoint,[N43] near which, at Icy Reef, Hooper also saw a fewhouses.[N44]    [Footnote N41: This was the name of a girl at Nuwŭk.]    [Footnote N42: Op. cit., p. 269.]    [Footnote N43: Second Exp., p. 142.]    [Footnote N44: Tents of the Tuski, p. 255.]As already stated, Capt. E. E. Smith was informed by the natives thatthere is now no village farther west than Herschel Island, where thereis one of considerable size. If he was correctly informed, this mustbe a new village, since the older explorers who passed along the coastfound only a summer camp at this point. He also states that he foundlarge numbers of ruined iglus on the outlying sandy islands along thecoast, especially near Anxiety Point. We have scarcely any informationabout these people, as the only white men who have seen them hadlittle intercourse with them in passing along the coast.[N45] ThePoint Barrow people have but slight acquaintance with them, as theysee them only a short time each summer. Captain Smith, however,informs me that in the summer of 1885 one boat load of them came backwith the Point Barrow traders to Point Barrow, where he saw them onboard of his ship. There was a man at Utkiavwĭñ who was called “theKûñmû´dlĭñ.” He came there when a child, probably, by adoption, andwas in no way distinguishable from the other people.    [Footnote N45: All the published information there is about them    from personal observation can be found in Franklin, Second Exp.,    p. 142; T. Simpson, Narrative, pp. 118-123; and Hooper, Tents,    etc., pp. 255-257 and 260.]Father Petitot appears to include these people in the “Taρèoρmeut”division of his “Tchiglit” Eskimo, whom he loosely describes asinhabiting the coast from Herschel Island to Liverpool Bay, includingthe delta of the Mackenzie,[N46] without locating their permanentvillages. In another place, however, he excludes the “Taρèoρmeut” fromthe “Tchiglit,” saying, “Dans l’ouest, les _Tchiglit_ communiquaientavec leurs plus proches voisins les Taρèoρ-meut,”[N47] while in athird place[N48] he gives the country of the “Tchiglit” as extendingfrom the Coppermine River to the Colville, and on his map in the samevolume, the “Tareormeut” are laid down in the Mackenzie delta only.According to his own account, however, he had no personal knowledge ofany Eskimo west of the Mackenzie delta. These people undoubtedly havea local name derived from that of their winter village, but it is yetto be learned.    [Footnote N46: Monographie, p. xi.]    [Footnote N47: Ibid, p. xvi.]    [Footnote N48: Bull. de la Société de Géographie, 6^e sér., vol.    10, p. 256.]It is possible that they do consider themselves the same people withthe Eskimo of the Mackenzie delta, and call themselves by the generalname of “Taρèoρmeut” (= Taxaiomiun in the Point Barrow dialect),“those who live by the sea.” That they do not call themselves“Kûñmû´dlĭñ” or “Kanmali-enyuin” or “Kangmaligmeut” is to my mindquite certain. The word “Kûñmû´dlĭñ,” as already stated, is used atNorton Sound to designate the people of Point Barrow (I was called a“Kûñmû´dlĭñ” by some Eskimo at St. Michaels because I spoke the PointBarrow dialect), who do not recognize the name as belonging tothemselves, but have transferred it to the people under consideration.Now, “Kûñmû´dlĭñ” is a word formed after the analogy of many Eskimowords from a noun kûñme and the affix lĭñ or dlĭñ (in Greenlandiclik), “one who has a ----.” The radical noun, the meaning of which Ican not ascertain, would become in the Mackenzie dialect kρagmaρk(using Petitot’s orthography), which with -lik in the plural wouldmake kρagmalit. (According to Petitot’s “Grammaire” the plural of -likin the Mackenzie dialect is -lit, and not -gdlit, as in Greenlandic).This is the name given by Petitot on his map to the people of theAnderson River,[N49] while he calls the Anderson River itselfKρagmalik.[N50] The father, however, had but little personal knowledgeof the natives of the Anderson, having made but two, apparently brief,visits to their village in 1865, when he first made the acquaintanceof the Eskimo. He afterwards became fairly intimate with the Eskimo ofthe Mackenzie delta, parties of whom spent the summers of 1869 and1870 with him. From these parties he appears to have obtained thegreater part of the information embodied in his Monographie andVocabulaire, as he explicitly states that he brought the last party toFort Good Hope “autant pour les instruire à loisir que pour apprendred’eux leur idiome.”[N51] Nothing seems to me more probable than thathe learned from these Mackenzie people the names of their neighbors ofthe Anderson, which he had failed to obtain in his flying visits 5years before, and that it is the same name, “Kûñmû´dlĭñ,” which wehave followed from Norton Sound and found always applied to the peoplejust beyond us. Could we learn the meaning of this word the questionmight be settled, but the only possible derivation I can see for it isfrom the Greenlandic Karmaĸ, a wall, which throws no light upon thesubject. Petitot calls the people of Cape Bathurst Kρagmaliveit, whichappears to mean “the real Kûñmû´dlĭñ” (“Kûñmû´dlĭñ” and the affix-vik, “the real”).    [Footnote N49: See also Monographie, etc., p. xi, where the name    is spelled Kρamalit.]    [Footnote N50: Vocabulaire, etc., p. 76.]    [Footnote N51: Bull. Soc. de Géog., 6^e sér., vol. 10, p. 39.]The Kupûñmiun appear to inhabit the permanent villages which have beenseen near the western mouth of the Mackenzie, at Shingle Point[N52]and Point Sabine,[N53] with an outlying village, supposed to bedeserted, at Point Kay.[N54] They are the natives described by Petitotin his Monographie as the Taρèoρmeut division of the Tchiglit, towhom, from the reasons already stated, most of his account seems toapply. There appears to me no reasonable doubt, considering hisopportunities for observing these people, that Taρèoρmeut, “those whodwell by the sea,” is the name that they actually apply to themselves,and that Kupûñmiun, or Kopagmut, “those who live on the Great River,”is a name bestowed upon them by their neighbors, perhaps their westernneighbors alone, since all the references to this name seem to betraceable to the authority of Dr. Simpson. Should they apply tothemselves a name of similar meaning, it would probably be of adifferent form, as, according to Petitot,[N55] they call the MackenzieKuρvik, instead of Kupûk or Kupûñ.    [Footnote N52: T. Simpson, Narrative, p. 112.]    [Footnote N53: Hooper, Tents, etc., p. 264.]    [Footnote N54: ibid, p. 263.]    [Footnote N55: Bull. Soc. de Géog., 6^e sér., vol. 10, p. 182.]These are the people who visit Fort Macpherson every spring andsummer,[N56] and are well known to the Hudson Bay traders as theMackenzie River Eskimo. They are the Eskimo encountered betweenHerschel Island and the mouth of the Mackenzie by Franklin, by Deaseand Simpson, and by Hooper and Pullen, all of whom have publishedbrief notes concerning them.[N57]    [Footnote N56: Petitot, Monographie, etc., pp. xvi and xx.]    [Footnote N57: Franklin, 2d Exp., pp. 99-101, 105-110, 114-119 and    128; T. Simpson, Narrative, pp. 104-112; Hooper, Tents, etc., pp.    263-264. There is also a brief note by the Rev. W. W. Kirkby, in a    “Journey to the Youcan.” Smithsonian Report for 1864. These, with    Petitot’s in many respects admirable Monographie, comprise all the    information regarding these people from actual observation that    has been published. Richardson has described them at second hand    in his “Searching Expedition” and “Polar Regions.” The “Kopagmute”    of Petroff (Report, etc., p. 125) are a purely hypothetical people    invented to fill the space between “the coast people in the north    and the Athabascans in the south.”]We are still somewhat at a loss for the proper local names of the lastlabret-wearing Eskimo, those, namely, of the Anderson River and CapeBathurst. That they are not considered by the Taρèoρmeut as belongingto the same “tribe” with themselves is evident from the namesKρagmalit and Kρagmalivëit, applied to them by Petitot. Sir JohnRichardson, the first white man to encounter them (in 1826), says thatthey called themselves “Kitte-garrœ-oot,”[N58] and the Point Barrowpeople told Dr. Simpson of country called “Kit-te-ga´-ru” beyond theMackenzie.[N59] These people, as well as the Taρèoρmeut, whom theyclosely resemble, are described in Petitot’s Monographie, and briefnotices of them are given by Sir John Richardson,[N60] McClure,[N61]Armstrong,[N62] and Hooper.[N63] The arts and industries of thesepeople from the Mackenzie to the Anderson, especially the latterregion, are well represented in the National Museum by the collectionsof Messrs. Kennicott, Ross, and MacFarlane. The Point Barrow peoplesay that the Kupûñmiun are “bad;”[N64] but notwithstanding this smallparties from the two villages occasionally travel east to theMackenzie, and spend the winter at the Kupûñmiun village, whence theyvisit the “great house,” returning the following season. Such a partyleft Point Barrow June 15, 1882, declaring their intention of goingall the way to the Mackenzie. They returned August 25 or 26, 1883,when we were in the midst of the confusion of closing the station, sothat we learned no details of their journey. A letter with which theywere intrusted to be forwarded to the United States through theMackenzie River posts reached the Chief Signal Officer in the summerof 1883 by way of the Rampart House, on the Porcupine River, whence wereceived an answer by the bearer from the factor in charge. The Eskimoprobably sent the letter to the Rampart House by the Indians who visitthat post.    [Footnote N58: Franklin, 2d Exp., p. 203.]    [Footnote N59: Ibid., p. 269.]    [Footnote N60: Franklin, 2d Exp., pp. 193, 203 and 230; Searching    Exp., and Polar Regions, p. 300.]    [Footnote N61: N. W. Passage, pp. 84-98.]    [Footnote N62: Personal Narrative, p. 176.]    [Footnote N63: Tents, etc., pp. 343-348.]    [Footnote N64: Compare what Petitot has to say--Monographie, etc.,    p. xiii and passim--about the turbulent and revengeful character    of the “Tchiglit.”]The intercourse between these people is purely commercial. Dr.Simpson, in the paper so often quoted, gives an excellent detaileddescription of the course of this trade, which agrees in the main withour observations, though we did not learn the particulars of time anddistance as accurately as he did. There have been some importantchanges, however, since his time. A small party, perhaps five or sixfamilies, of “Nunatañmiun” now come every summer to Point Barrow aboutthe end of July, or as soon as the shallow bays along shore are open.They establish themselves at the summer camping ground at Pérnyɐ, atthe southwest corner of Elson Bay, and stay two or three weeks,trading with the natives and the ships, dancing, and shooting ducks.The eastward-bound parties seem to start a little earlier thanformerly (July 7, 1853, July 3, 1854,[N65] June 18, 1882, and June 29,1883). From all accounts their relations with the eastern people arenow perfectly friendly. We heard nothing of the precautionary measuresdescribed by Dr. Simpson,[N66] and the women talked frequently oftheir trading with the Kûñmû´dlĭñ and even with the Kupûñmiun.[N67] Wedid not learn definitely whether they met the latter at Barter Pointor whether they went still farther east.    [Footnote N65: Dr. Simpson, op. cit., p. 264.]    [Footnote N66: Op. cit., p. 265.]    [Footnote N67: In the Plover’s time they were left a day’s journey    in the rear.]Some of the Point Barrow parties do not go east of the Colville. Thearticles of trade have changed somewhat in the last 30 years, from thefact that the western natives can now buy directly from the whalersiron articles, arms, and ammunition, beads, tobacco, etc. TheNunatañmiun now sell chiefly furs, deerskins, and clothing ready madefrom them, woodenware (buckets and tubs), willow poles for settingnets, and sometimes fossil ivory. The double-edged Siberian knives areno longer in the market and appear to be going out of fashion, thougha few of them are still in use. Ready-made stone articles, like thewhetstones mentioned by Dr. Simpson,[N68] are rarely, if ever, in themarket. We did not hear of the purchase of stone lamps from theeastern natives. This is probably due to a cessation of the demand forthem at Point Barrow, owing to the falling off in the population.    [Footnote N68: Op. cit., p. 266.]The Kûñmû´dlĭñ no longer furnish guns and ammunition, as the westernnatives prefer the breech-loading arms they obtain from the whalers tothe flintlock guns sold by the Hudson Bay Company. The trade withthese people seems to be almost entirely for furs and skins, notablyblack and red fox skins and wolverine skins. Skins of the narwhal orbeluga are no longer mentioned as important articles of trade.In return for these things the western natives give sealskins, etc.,especially oil, as formerly, though I believe that very little, ifany, whalebone is now carried east, since the natives prefer to saveit for trading with the ships in the hope of getting liquor, or armsand ammunition, and various articles of American manufacture, beads,kettles, etc. I was told by an intelligent native of Utkiavwĭñ thatbrass kettles were highly prized by the Kupûñmiun, and that a largeone would bring three wolverine skins,[N69] three black foxskins, orfive red ones. One woman was anxious to get all the empty tin cans shecould, saying that she could sell them to the Kûñmû´dlĭñ for a foxskinapiece. We were told that the eastern natives were glad to buy gunflints and bright-colored handkerchiefs, and that the Nunatañmiunwanted blankets and playing cards.    [Footnote N69: T. Simpson saw iron kettles at Camden Bay which had    been purchased from the western natives at two wolverine skins    apiece. Narrative, p. 171.]_Indians._--They informed us that east of the Colville they sometimesmet “Itkû´dlĭñ,” people with whom they could not converse, but whowere friendly and traded with them, buying oil for fox skins. Theywere said to live back of the coast between the Colville and theMackenzie, and were described as wearing no labrets, but rings intheir ears and noses. They wear their hair long, do not tonsure thecrown, and are dressed in jackets of skin with the hair removed,without hoods, and ornamented with beads and fringe. We saw one or twosuch jackets in Utkiavwĭñ apparently made of moose skin, and a fewpouches of the same material, highly ornamented with beads. They havelong flintlock guns, white man’s wooden pipes, which they valuehighly, and axes--not adzes--with which they “break many trees.” Weeasily understood from this description that Indians were meant, andsince our return I have been able to identify one or two of the tribeswith tolerable certainty.They seem better acquainted with these people than in Dr. Simpson’stime, and know the word “kŭtchin,” people, in which many of the tribalnames end. We did not hear the names Ko´yukan or Itkalya´ruin whichDr. Simpson learned, apparently from the Nunatañmiun.[N70] I heard oneman speak of the Kŭtcha Kutchin, who inhabit the “Yukon from the BirchRiver to the Kotlo River on the east and the Porcupine River on thenorth, ascending the latter a short distance.”[N71]    [Footnote N70: “The inland Eskimo also call them Ko´-yu-kan, and    divide them into three sections or tribes. * * *    One is called I´t-ka-lyi [apparently the plural of Itkûdlĭñ],    * * * the second It-kal-ya´-ruīn [different or other Itkûdlĭñ],”    op. cit., p. 269.]    [Footnote N71: Dall, Cont. to N. A. Ethn., vol. 1, p. 30, where    they are identified with Itkalyaruin of Simpson.]One of the tribes with which they have dealings is the “Rat Indians”of the Hudson Bay men, probably the Vunta´-Kŭtchin,[N72] from the factthat they visit Fort Yukon. These are the people whom Capt. Maguiremet on his unsuccessful sledge journey to the eastward to communicatewith Collinson. The Point Barrow people told us that “Magwa” went eastto see “Colli´k-sina,” but did not see him, only saw the Itkûdlĭñ.Collinson,[N73] speaking of Maguire’s second winter at Point Barrow,says: “In attempting to prosecute the search easterly, an armed bodyof Indians of the Koyukun tribe were met with, and were so hostilethat he was compelled to return.” Maguire himself, in his officialreport,[N74] speaks of meeting _four_ Indians who had followed hisparty for several days. He says nothing of any hostile demonstration;in fact, says they showed signs of disappointment at his havingnothing to trade with them, but his Eskimo, he says, called themKoyukun, which he knew was the tribe that had so barbarously murderedLieut. Barnard at Nulato in 1851. Moreover, each Indian had a musket,and he had only two with a party of eight men, so he thought it saferto turn back. However, he seems to have distributed among them printed“information slips,” which they immediately carried to Fort Yukon, andreturning to the coast with a letter from the clerk in charge,delivered it to Capt. Collinson on board of the _Enterprise_ at BarterIsland, July 18, 1854. The letter is as follows:    FORT YOUCON, _June 27, 1854_.  The printed slips of paper delivered by the officers of H.M.S.  _Plover_ on the 25th of April, 1854, to the Rat Indians were  received on the 27th of June, 1854, at the Hudson Bay Company’s  establishment, Fort Youcon. The Rat Indians are in the habit of  making periodical trading excursions to the Esquimaux along the  coast. They are a harmless, inoffensive set of Indians, ever ready  and willing to render any assistance they can to the whites.    WM. LUCAS HARDISTY,    _Clerk in charge_.[N75]    [Footnote N72: Ibid., p. 31.]    [Footnote N73: Arctic Papers, p. 119.]    [Footnote N74: Further papers, etc., pp. 905 et seq.]    [Footnote N75: Arctic Papers, p. 144.]Capt. Collinson evidently never dreamed of identifying this “harmless,inoffensive set of Indians” with “an armed body of Indians of theKoyukun tribe.” It is important that his statement, quoted above,should be corrected lest it serve as authority for extending the rangeof the Koyukun Indians[N76] to the Arctic Ocean. The Point Barrowpeople also know the name of the U´na-kho-tānā,[N77] or En´akotina, asthey pronounce it. Their intercourse with all these Indians appears tobe rather slight and purely commercial. Friendly relations existedbetween the Rat Indians and the “Eskimos who live somewhere near theColville” as early as 1849,[N78] while it was still “war to the knife”between the Peel River Indians and the Kupûñmiun.[N79]    [Footnote N76: Koyū´-ku´kh-otā´nā, Dall, Cont. to N. A. Eth.,    p. 27.]    [Footnote N77: Ibid., p. 28.]    [Footnote N78: Hooper, Tents, etc. p. 276.]    [Footnote N79: Ibid., p. 273.]The name Itkû´dlĭñ, of which I´t-ka-lyi of Dr. Simpson appears to bethe plural, is a generic word for an Indian, and is undoubtedly thesame as the Greenland word erĸileĸ--plural erĸigdlit--which means afabulous “inlander” with a face like a dog. “They are martial spiritsand inhuman foes to mankind; however, they only inhabit the east sideof the land.”[N80] Dr. Rink[N81] has already pointed out that thisname is in use as far as the Mackenzie River--for instance, theIndians are called “eert-kai-lee” (Parry), or “it-kagh-lie” (Lyon), atFury and Hecla Strait; ik-kil-lin (Gilder), at the west shore ofHudson Bay, and “itkρe´le´it” (Petitot) at the Mackenzie. Petitot alsogives this word as itkpe´lit in his vocabulary (p. 42). These words,including the term Ingalik, or In-ka-lik, applied by the natives ofNorton Sound to the Indians,[N82] and which Mr. Dall was informedmeant “children of a louse’s egg,” all appear to be compounds of theword erĸeĸ, a louse egg, and the affix lik. (I suspect erĸileĸ, fromthe form of its plural, to be a corruption of “erĸiliĸ,” since thereis no recognized affix -leĸ in Greenlandic.)    [Footnote N80: Crantz, vol. 1, p. 208.]    [Footnote N81: Journ. Anthrop. Inst., 1885, p. 244.]    [Footnote N82: Dall, Alaska, p. 28 and Contrib., vol. 1, p. 25.]Petitot[N83] gives an interesting tradition in regard to the origin ofthis name: “La tradition Innok dédaigne de parler ici desPeaux-Rouges. L’áyant fait observer á mon narrateur Aρviuna: ‘Oh!’ merepondait-il, ‘il ne vaut pas la peine d’en parler. Ils naquirentaussi dans l’ouest, sur l’ile du Castor, des larves de nos poux. C’éstpourquoi nous les nommons Itkρe´le´it.’”    [Footnote N83: Monographie, p. xxiv.]CONTACT WITH CIVILIZED PEOPLE.Until the visit of the _Blossom’s_ barge in 1826 these people hadnever seen a white man, although they were already in possession oftobacco and articles of Russian manufacture, such as copper kettles,which they had obtained from Siberia by way of the Diomedes. Mr.Elson’s party landed only at Refuge Inlet, and had but littleintercourse with the natives. His visit seemed to have been forgottenby the time of the _Plover’s_ stay at Point Barrow, though Dr. Simpsonfound people who recollected the visit of Thomas Simpson in 1837.[N84]The latter, after he had left the boats and was proceeding on footwith his party, first met the Nuwŭñmiun at Point Tangent, where therewas a small party encamped, from whom he purchased the umiak in whichhe went on to Point Barrow. He landed there early in the morning ofAugust 4, and went down to the summer camp at Pernyɐ, where he stayedtill 1 o’clock in the afternoon, trading with the natives and watchingthem dance. On his return to Point Tangent some of the nativesaccompanied him to Boat Extreme, where he parted from them August 6,so that his whole intercourse with them was confined to less than aweek.[N85]    [Footnote N84: Op. cit., p. 264.]    [Footnote N85: Narrative, pp. 146-168.]The next white men who landed at Point Barrow were the party in the_Plover’s_ boats, under Lieuts. Pullen and Hooper, on their way to theMackenzie, and the crew of Mr. Sheddon’s yacht, the _Nancy Dawson_, inthe summer of 1849. The boats were from July 29 to August 3 gettingfrom Cape Smyth past Point Barrow, when the crews were ashore for acouple of days and did a little trading with the natives, whom theyfound very friendly. They afterwards had one or two skirmishes withevil-disposed parties of Nuwŭñmiun returning from the east in theneighborhood of Return Reef. The exploring ships _Enterprise_ and_Investigator_ also had casual meetings with the natives, who receivedtobacco, etc., from the ships.The depot ship _Plover_, Commander Maguire, spent the winters of1852-’53 and 1853-’54 at Point Barrow, and the officers and crew,after some misunderstandings and skirmishes, established very friendlyand sociable relations with the natives. The only published accountsof the _Plover’s_ stay at Point Barrow are Commander Maguire’sofficial reports, published in the Parliamentary Reports (Blue Books)for 1854, pp. 165-185, and 1855, pp. 905 et seq., and Dr. Simpson’spaper, already mentioned. Maguire’s report of the first winter’sproceedings is also published as an appendix to Sherard Osborne’s“Discovery of the Northwest Passage.”We found that the elder natives remembered Maguire, whom they called“Magwa,” very well. They gave us the names of many of his people and avery correct account of the most important proceedings, though theydid not make it clear that the death of the man mentioned in hisreport was accidental. They described “Magwa” as short and fat, with avery thick neck, and all seemed very much impressed with the height ofhis first lieutenant, “Epi´ana” (_Vernon_), who had “lots of guns.”It was difficult to see that the _Plover’s_ visit had exerted anypermanent influence on these people. In fact, Dr. Simpson’s account oftheir habits and customs would serve very well for the present time,except in regard to the use of firearms. They certainly remembered noEnglish. Indeed, Dr. Simpson says[N86] that they learned hardly any.The _Plover’s_ people probably found it very easy to do as we did andadopt a sort of jargon of Eskimo words and “pigeon English” grammarfor general intercourse. Although, according to the account of thenatives, there was considerable intercourse between the sailors andthe Eskimo women, there are now no people living at either village whowe could be sure were born from such intercourse, though one woman wassuspected of being half English. She was remarkable only for her largebuild, and was not lighter than many pure-blooded women.    [Footnote N86: Op. cit., p. 251.]Since 1854, when the first whalers came as far north as the Point,there has hardly been a season in which ships have not visited thisregion, and for a couple of months every year the natives have hadconsiderable intercourse with the whites, going off to the ships totrade, while the sailors come ashore occasionally. We found that theyusually spoke of white men as “kablu´na;” but they informed us thatthey had another word, “tû´n-nyĭn,” which they used to employ amongthemselves when they saw a ship. Dr. Simpson[N87] says that theylearned the word “kabluna” from the eastern natives, but that thelatter (he gives it Tan´-ning or Tan´-gin) came from the Nunata´ñmiun.He supposes it to apply to the Russians, who had regular bath days attheir posts, and says it is derived from tan-nikh-lu-go, to wash orcleanse the person.    [Footnote N87: Op. cit., p. 271.]The chief change resulting from their intercourse with the whites hasbeen the introduction of firearms. Nearly all the natives are nowprovided with guns, some of them of the best modern patterns ofbreechloaders, and they usually succeed in procuring a supply ofammunition. This is in some respects a disadvantage, as the reindeerhave become so wild that the natives would no longer be able toprocure a sufficient number of them for food and clothing with theirformer appliances, and they are thus rendered dependent on the ships.On the other hand, with a plentiful supply of ammunition it is easierfor them to procure abundance of food, both deer and seals, and theyare less liable to famine than in former times.There is no reason to fear, as has been suggested, that they will losethe art of making any of their own weapons except in the case of thebow. With firearms alone they would be unable to obtain any seals,a much more important source of food than the reindeer, and their ownappliances for sealing are much better than any civilizedcontrivances. Although they have plenty of the most improved modernwhaling gear, they are not likely to forget the manufacture of theirown implements for this purpose, as this important fishery is ruled bytradition and superstition, which insists that at least one harpoon ofthe ancient pattern must be used in taking every whale. All are nowrich in iron, civilized tools, canvas and wreck wood, and in thisrespect their condition is improved.They have, however, adopted very few civilized habits. They havecontracted a taste for civilized food, especially hard bread andflour, but this they are unable to obtain for 10 months of the year,and they are thus obliged to adhere to their former habits. In fact,except in regard to the use of firearms and mechanics’ tools, theystruck me as essentially a conservative people.Petroff[N88] makes the assertion that in late years their movementshave been guided chiefly by those of the whalers. As far as we couldobserve they have not changed the course or time of their journeyssince Dr. Simpson’s time, except that they have given up the autumnwhaling, possibly on account of the presence of the ships at thatseason. Of course, men who are rich in whalebone now stay to tradewith the ships, while those who have plenty of oil go east. They arenot absolutely dependent on the ships for anything except ammunition,and even during the short time the ships are with them they hardlyneglect their own pursuits.    [Footnote N88: Report, etc., p. 125.]The one unmitigated evil of their intercourse with the whites has beenthe introduction of spirits. Apart from the direct injury which liquordoes to their health, their passionate fondness for it leads them tobarter away valuable articles which should have served to procureammunition or other things of permanent use. It is to be hoped,however, that the liquor traffic is decreasing. The vigilance of therevenue cutter prevents regular whisky traders from reaching theArctic Ocean, and public opinion among the whaling captains seems tobe growing in the right direction.Another serious evil, which it would be almost impossible to check, isthe unlimited intercourse of the sailors with the Eskimo women. Thewhites can hardly be said to have introduced laxity of sexual morals,but they have encouraged a natural savage tendency, and have taughtthem prostitution for gain, which has brought about great excesses,fortunately confined to a short season. This may have something to dowith the want of fertility among the women.Our two years of friendly relations with these people were greatly totheir advantage. Not only were our house and our doings a constantsource of amusement to them, but they learned to respect and trust thewhites. Without becoming dependent on us or receiving any favorswithout some adequate return either in work or goods, they were ableto obtain tobacco, hard bread, and many other things of use to them,all through the year. Our presence prevented their procuring more thantrifling quantities of spirits, and though the supply ofbreech-loading ammunition was pretty well cut off, they could getplenty of powder and shot for their muzzle loaders. The abundance ofcivilized food was undoubtedly good for them, and our surgeon was ableto give them a great deal of help in sickness.In all their intercourse with the whites they have learned very littleEnglish, chiefly a few oaths and exclamations like “Get out of here,”and the words of such songs as “Little Brown Jug” and “Shoo Fly,”curiously distorted. They have as a rule invented genuine Eskimo wordsfor civilized articles which are new to them.[N89] Even in theirintimate relations with us they learned but few more phrases and inmost cases without a knowledge of their meaning.    [Footnote N89: See list of “New Words,” Rep. Point Barrow Exp.,    p. 57.]There are a few Hawaiian words introduced by the Kanaka sailors on thewhaleships, which are universally employed between whites and Eskimoalong the whole of the Arctic coast, and occasionally at least amongthe Eskimo themselves. These are _kau-kau_,[N90] food, or to eat;_hana-hana_, work; _pûnĭ-pûnĭ_, _coitus_, and _pau_, not. _Wahíne_,woman, is also used, but is less common. Another foreign word nowuniversally employed among them in their intercourse with the whites,and even, I believe, among themselves, is “kuníɐ” for woman or wife.They themselves told us that it was not an Eskimo word--“When therewere no white men, there was no _kuníɐ_”--and some of the whalemen whohad been at Hudson Bay said it was the “Greenland” word for woman. Itwas not until our return to this country that we discovered it to bethe Danish word _kone_, woman, which in the corrupted form “coony” isin common use among the eastern Eskimo generally in the jargon theyemploy in dealing with the whites. _Kuníɐ_ is “coony” with the suffixof the third person, and therefore means “his wife.” It is sometimesused at Point Barrow for either of a married couple in the sense ofour word “spouse.”    [Footnote N90: The history of this word, which also appears as a    Chuckch word in some of the vocabularies collected by    Nordenskiöld’s expedition, is rather curious. Chamisso (Kotzebue’s    Voyage, vol. 2, p. 392, foot-note) says that this is a Hawaiian    corruption of the well-known “Pigeon-English” (he calls it    Chinese) word “chow-chow” recently (in 1816-’17) adopted by the    Sandwich Islanders from the people with whom they trade. I am    informed that the word is not of Chinese origin, but probably came    from India, like many other words in “Pigeon-English.” Chamisso    also calls _pûnĭ-pûnĭ_ a Chinese word, but I have been able to    learn nothing of its origin.]NATURAL RESOURCES.ANIMALS.These people are acquainted with the following animals, all of whichare more or less hunted, and serve some useful purpose._Mammals._--The wolf, amáxo (Canis lupus griseo-albus), is notuncommon in the interior, but rarely if ever reaches the coast. Redand black foxes, kaiă´ktûk (Vulpes fulvus fulvus and argentatus), arechiefly known from their skins, which are common articles in the tradewith the eastern natives, and the same is true of the wolverine,ka´vwĭñ (Gulo luscus), and the marten, kabweatyía (Mustela americana).The arctic fox, tĕrĭgûniɐ (Vulpes lagopus), is very abundant along thecoast, while the ermine (Putorius erminea) and Parry’s spermophile(Spermophilus empetra empetra) are not rare. The last is calledsĭksĭñ. Lemmings, a´vwĭñɐ, of two species (Cuniculus torquatus andMyodes obensis) are very abundant some years, and they recognize atiny shrewmouse (Sorex forsteri). This little animal is called ugrúnɐ,a word corresponding to the name ugssungnaĸ given to the same animalin Labrador, which, according to Kleinschmidt,[N91] is an ironicalapplication of the name of the largest seal, ugssuk (ugru at PointBarrow), to the smallest mammal known to the Eskimo. The same name isalso applied at Point Barrow to the fossil ox, whose bones aresometimes found. The most abundant land animal, however, is thereindeer, tŭ´ktu (Rangifer tarandus grœnlandicus), which is found inwinter in great herds along the upper waters of the rivers,occasionally coming down to the coast, and affords a very importantsupply of food.    [Footnote N91: Grønlandsk Ordbog, p. 386.]The moose, tŭ´ktuwŭñ, or “big reindeer” (Alce machlis), is well knownfrom the accounts of the Nunatañmiun, who bring moose skins to trade.Some of the natives have been east to hunt the mountain sheep, i´mnêɐ(Ovis canadensis dalli), and all are familiar with its skin, horns,and teeth, which they buy of the eastern natives. The musk ox, umĭñmau(Ovibos moschatus), is known only from its bones, which are sometimesfound on the tundra. Inland, near the rivers, they also find a largebrown bear, ă´kqlak, which is probably the barren ground bear, whileon the ice-pack, the polar bear, nä´nu (Thalassarctos maritimus), isnot uncommon, sometimes making raids on the provision storehouses inthe villages.The most important sea animal is the little rough seal, nĕtyĭĸ (Phocafœtida), which is very abundant at all seasons. Its flesh is the greatstaple of food, while its blubber supplies the Eskimo lamps, and itsskin serves countless useful purposes. The great bearded seal, úgru(Erignathus barbatus), is less common. It is especially valued for itshide, which serves for covering the large boats and making stoutharpoon lines. Two other species of seal, the harbor seal, kasigía(Phoca vitulina), and the beautiful ribbon seal, kaixólĭñ (Phocafasciata), are known, but both are uncommon, the latter very rare.Herds of walrus, ai´bwêk (Odobænus obesus), pass along the coast inthe open season, generally resting on cakes of floating ice, and arepursued for their hides and ivory as well as their flesh and blubber.Whales, akbwêk, of the species Balæna mysticetus, most pursued for itsoil and whalebone, travel along the coast in the leads of open waterabove described from the middle of April to the latter part of June inlarge numbers, and return in the autumn, appearing about the end ofAugust. White whales, kĭlĕlua (Delphinapterus sp.), are not uncommonin the summer, and they say the narwhal, tugálĭñ (Monodon monoceros),is occasionally seen. They are also acquainted with another cetacean,which they call áxlo, and which appears from their description to be aspecies of Orca._Birds._--In the spring, that is during May and the early part ofJune, vast flocks of migrating ducks pass to the northeast, close tothe shore, a few only remaining to breed, and return at the end of thesummer from the latter part of July to the end of September. Nearlyall the returning birds cross the isthmus of Point Barrow at Pernyɐwhere the natives assemble in large numbers for the purpose of takingthem. These migrating birds are mostly king ducks, kĭñalĭñ (Somateriaspectabilis), Pacific eiders, amau´lĭñ (S. v-nigra), and long-tailedducks, a´dyigi´a, a´hadlĭñ (Clangula hyemalis), with smaller numbersof the spectacled eider, ka´waso (Arctonetta fischeri), and Steller’sducks, ĭgnikau´kto (Eniconetta stelleri). At the rivers they also findnumbers of pintails, i´vwûgɐ (Dafila acuta), which visit the coast insmall numbers during the migrations. Geese of three species, theAmerican white-fronted goose, nû´glûgruɐ (Anser albifrons gambeli),the lesser snow-goose, kû´ño (Chen hyperborea), and the black brant,nûglû´gnɐ (Branta nigricans), are not uncommon on the coast bothduring the migrations and the breeding season, but the natives findthem in much greater abundance at the rivers, where they also find aspecies of swan, ku´gru, probably Olor columbianus, which rarelyvisits the coast.Next in importance to the natives are the gulls, of which the PointBarrow gull, nau´yɐ (Larus barrovianus), is the most abundant allthrough the season, though the rare rosy gull, kă´ñmaxlu (Rhodostethesrosea), appears in multitudes late in the autumn. The ivory gull(Gavia alba), nariyalbwûñ, and Sabine’s gull, yûkû´drĭgûgi´ɐ (XemaSabinii), are uncommon, while the Arctic tern, utyuta´kĭn (Sternaparadisea), is rather abundant, especially about the sandspits ofNuwŭk. All these species, particularly the larger ones, are taken forfood.Three species of loons are common: the great white-billed loon,tu´dlĭñ (Urinator adamsi), and the Pacific and red-throated divers(U. pacificus and lumme), which are not distinguished from each otherbut are both called kă´ksau. They also occasionally see thethick-billed guillemot a´kpa (Uria lomvia arra), and more often thesea-pigeon, sêkbwɐk (Cephus mandtii). The three species of jaegers(Stercorarius pomarinus, parasiticus, and longicaudus) are notdistinguished from one another but are all called isuñɐ. They pay butlittle attention to the numerous species of wading birds which appearin considerable abundance in the migrations and breeding season, butthey recognize among them the turnstone, tûlĭ´gwa (Arenariainterpres), the gray plover, ki´raio´n (Charadrius squatarola), theAmerican golden plover, tu´dlĭñ (C. dominicus), the knot, tu´awi´a(Tringa canutus), the pectoral and Baird’s sandpipers, (T. maculataand bairdii), both called ai´bwûkiɐ, the red-backed sandpiper mêkapĭñ(T. alpina pacifica), the semipalmated sandpiper, nĭwĭlĭwĭ´lûk(Ereunetes pusillus), the buff-breasted sandpiper, nu´dluayu(Tryngites subruficollis), the red phalarope, sabrañ (Chrymophilusfulicarius), and the northern phalarope, sabrañnɐ; (Phalaropuslobatus). The last is rare at Point Barrow, but they see many of themnear the Colville. The little brown crane, tutĭ´drĭgɐ (Gruscanadensis), is also rare at the Point, but they say they find many ofthem at the mouth of Kulu´grua.Of land birds, the most familiar are the little snow bunting, amauligɐ(Plectrophenax nivalis), the first bird to arrive in the spring, theLapland longspur, nĕssau´dligɐ (Calcarius lapponicus), and two speciesof grouse, the willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus) and the rock ptarmigan(L. rupestris), which are both called akû´dĭgĭn. These two birds donot migrate, but are to be seen all winter, as is also the well knownsnowy owl, u´kpĭk (Nyctea nyctea). A gerfalcon, kĭ´drĭgûmĭñ (Falcorusticolus), is also sometimes seen, and skins and feathers of thegolden eagle, tĭ´ñmiɐkpûk, “the great bird” (Aquila chrysætos), arebrought from the east for charms and ornaments. The raven, tulúɐ(Corvus corax sinuatus), was not seen at Point Barrow, but the nativesare familiar with it and have many of its skins for amulets. Severalspecies of small land birds also occur in small numbers, but thenatives are not familiar with them and call them all “sû´ksaxíɐ.” Thisname appears to mean “wanderer” or “flutterer,” and probably belongs,I believe, to the different species of redpolls (Aegiothus)._Fishes._--A few species only of fish are found in the salt water. Ofthese the most abundant are the little polar cod (Boreogadus saida),which is plentiful through the greater part of the year, and is oftenan important source of food, and the capelin, añmû´grûñ (Mallotusvillosus), which is found in large schools close to the beach in themiddle of summer. There are also caught sometimes two species ofsculpins, kû´naio (Cottus quadricornis and decastrensis), and twospecies of Lycodes, kúgraunɐ (L. turnerii and coccineus). In the gillnets at Elson Bay they also catch two species of salmon (Onchorhynchusgorbuscha and nerka) and a whitefish (Coregonus laurettæ) in smallnumbers, and occasionally a large trout (Salvelinus malma). Thelast-named fish they find sometimes in great numbers, near the mouthof the Colville.The greatest quantities of fish are taken in the rivers, especiallyKuaru and Kulugrua, by fishing through the ice in the winter. They saythere are no fish taken in Ikpikpûñ, and account for this byexplaining that the former two rivers freeze down to the bottom on theshallow bars inclosing deep pools in which the fish are held, while inthe latter the ice never touches the bottom, so that the fish are freeto run down to the sea. The species caught are the small Coregonuslaurettæ, two large whitefish (C. kennicottii and nelsoni), and theburbot, tita´liñ (Lota maculosa). They speak of a fish, sulukpau´ga(which appears to mean “wing-fin” and is applied in Greenland to aspecies of Sebastes), that is caught with the hook in Kulugruaapparently only in summer, and seems from the description to be Back’sgrayling (Thymallus signifer). In the river Ku is caught a smelt,ĭthoa´nĭñ (Osmerus dentex). In the great lake, Tă´syûkpûñ (see above,p. 29), they tell of an enormous fish “as big as a kaiak.” They gaveit no name, but describe it as having a red belly and white flesh. Oneman said he had seen one 18 feet long, but another was more moderate,giving about 3 feet as the length of the longest he had seen._Insects and other invertebrates._--Of insects, they recognize thetroublesome mosquito, kiktorɐ (Culex spp.), flies, bumblebees, andgadflies (Œestrus tarandi), both of which they seem much afraid of,and call i´gutyai, and the universal louse, ku´mɐk. All the largewinged insects, including the rare butterflies and moths and craneflies, are called tûkĭlû´kica, or tûkilûkĭdja´ksûn, which is also thename of the yellow poppy (Papaver nudicaule). We were told that “byand by” the poppies would turn into “little birds” and fly away, whichled us to suppose that there was some yellow butterfly which we shouldfind abundant in the later summer, but we saw none either season.A small spider is sometimes found in the Eskimo houses, and is calledpidrairu´rɐ, “the little braider.” They pay but little attention toother invertebrates, but are familiar with worms, kupidro, a speciesof crab, kinau´rɐ, (Hyas latifrons), and the little branchipus,iritu´ña (Greenlandic issitôrak, “the little one with big eyes”), ofthe fresh water-pools. Cockles (Buccinum, etc.) are called siu´tigo(Gr. siuterok, from siut, ear), and clams have a name which we failedto obtain. Jellyfish are called ipiaru´rɐ, “like bags.” They say the“Kûñmudlĭñ” eat them!PLANTS.Few plants that are of any service to man grow in this region. Thewillows, ŭ´kpĭk, of various species, which near the coast are nothingbut creeping vines, are sometimes used as fuel, especially along therivers, where they grow into shrubs 5 or 6 feet high. Their catkinsare used for tinder and the moss, mû´nĭk, furnishes wicks for thelamps. We could find no fruit that could be eaten. A cranberry(Vaccinium vitis-idæa) occurs, but produced no fruit either season. Nouse is made of the different species of grass, which are especiallyluxuriant around the houses at Utkiavwĭñ, where the ground is richlymanured with various sorts of refuse,[N92] though the species ofmosses and lichens furnish the reindeer with food easily reached inthe winter through the light covering of snow. Little attention ispaid to the numerous, and sometimes showy, flowering plants. Welearned but two names of flowers, the one mentioned above,tûkĭlû´kica, tûkĭlûkĭdja´ksûn, which seemed to be applied to allstriking yellow or white flowers, such as Papaver, Ranunculus, andDraba, and mai´sun, the bright pink Pedicularis. All the wood used inthis region, except the ready-made woodenware and the willow polesobtained from the Nunatañmiun, comes from the drift on the beach. Mostof this on the beach west of Point Barrow appears to come from thesouthwest, as the prevailing current along this shore is to thenortheast, and may be derived from the large rivers flowing intoKotzebue Sound, since it shows signs of having been long in the water.The driftwood, which is reported to be abundant east of Point Barrow,probably comes from the great rivers emptying into the Arctic Ocean.This wood is sufficiently abundant to furnish the natives with allthey need for fuel and other purposes, and consists chiefly of pine,spruce, and cottonwood, mostly in the form of water-worn logs, oftenof large size. Of late years, also, much wood of the different kindsused in shipbuilding has drifted ashore from wrecks.    [Footnote N92: “The oil had acted as a manure on the soil, and    produced a luxuriant crop of grass from 1 to 2 feet high” (village    at Point Atkinson, east of the Mackenzie). Richardson Searching    Exp., vol. 1, p. 254.]MINERALS.The people of this region are acquainted with few mineral substances,excluding the metals which they obtain from the whites. The mostimportant are flint, slate, soapstone, jade, and a peculiar form ofmassive pectolite, first described by Prof. F. W. Clarke[N93] fromspecimens brought home by our party. Flint, ánma, was formerly ingreat demand for arrow and spear heads and other implements, andaccording to Dr. Simpson[N94] was obtained from the Nunatañmiun. It isgenerally black or a slightly translucent gray, but we collected anumber of arrowheads, etc., made of jasper, red or variegated. A fewcrystals of transparent quartz, sometimes smoky, were also seen, andappeared to be used as amulets. Slate, ulu´ksɐ, “material for a roundknife,” was used, as its name imports, for making the woman’s roundknife, and for harpoon blades, etc. It is a smooth clay slate, varyingin hardness, and light green, red, purple, dark gray, or black incolor. All the pieces of soft gray soapstone, tună´ktɐ, which are socommon at both villages, are probably fragments of the lamps andkettles obtained in former years from the eastern natives. The jade isoften very beautiful, varying from a pale or bright translucent greento a dark olive, almost black, and was formerly used for making adzes,whetstones, and occasionally other implements. The pectolite,generally of a pale greenish or bluish color, was only found in theform of oblong, more or less cylindrical masses, used as hammerheads.Both of these minerals were called kau´dlo, and were said to come“from the east, a long way off,” from high rocky ground, but all thatwe could learn was very indefinite. Dr. Simpson was informed[N95] thatthe stones for making whetstones were brought from the Kuwûk River, sothat this jade is probably the same as that which is said to form JadeMountain, in that region.    [Footnote N93: U.S. Geol. Surv., Bull. 9, p. 9, 1884.]    [Footnote N94: Op. cit., p. 266.]    [Footnote N95: Op. cit., p. 266.]Bits of porphyry, syenite, and similar rocks are used for makinglabrets, and large pebbles are used as hammers and net sinkers. Theyhave also a little iron pyrites, both massive and in the form ofspherical concretions. The latter were said to come from the mouth ofthe Colville, and are believed by the natives to have fallen from thesky. Two other kinds of stone are brought from the neighborhood ofNu´ɐsŭknan, partly, it appears, as curiosities, and partly with someill defined mystical notions. The first are botryoidal masses of brownlimonite, resembling bog iron ore, and the other sort curiousconcretions, looking like the familiar “clay stones,” but very heavy,and apparently containing a great deal of iron pyrites. White gypsum,used for rubbing the flesh side of deerskins, is obtained on theseashore at a place called Tû´tyĕ, “one sleep” east from Point Barrow.Bituminous coal, alu´a, is well known, though not used for fuel. Manysmall fragments, which come perhaps from the vein at CapeBeaufort,[N96] are picked up on the beach. Shaly, very bituminouscoal, broken into small square fragments, is rather abundant on thebars of Kulugrua, whence specimens were brought by Capt. Herendeen.A native of Wainwright Inlet gave us to understand that coal existedin a regular vein near that place, and told a story of a burning hillin that region. This may be a coal bed on fire, or possibly “smokingcliffs,” like those seen by the _Investigator_ in Franklin Bay.[N97]We also heard a story of a lake of tar or bitumen, ádngun, said to besituated on an island a day’s sail east of the point. Blacklead,mĭ´ñun, and red ocher are abundant and used as pigments, but we didnot learn where they were obtained. Pieces of amber are sometimesfound on the beach and are carried as amulets or (rarely) made intobeads. Amber is called aúmɐ, a word that in other Eskimo dialects, andprobably in this also, means “a live coal.” Its application to a lumpof amber is quite a striking figure of speech.    [Footnote N96: Hooper found coal on the beach at Nuwŭk in 1849,    showing that this coal has not necessarily been thrown over from    ships. Tents of the Tuski, p. 221.]    [Footnote N97: Discovery of the Northwest Passage, p. 100.]CULTURE.MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE.FOOD._Substances used for food._--The food of these people consists almostentirely of animal substances. The staple article of food is the fleshof the rough seal, of which they obtain more than of any other meat.Next in importance is the venison of the reindeer, though this islooked upon as a kind of dainty.[N98] Many well developed fœtalreindeer are brought home from the spring deer hunt and are said to beexcellent eating, though we never saw them eaten. They also eat theflesh of the other three species of seal, the walrus, the polar bear,the “bowhead” whale, the white whale, and all the larger kinds ofbirds, geese, ducks, gulls, and grouse. All the different kinds offish appear to be eaten, with the possible exception of the twospecies of Lycodes (only a few of these were caught, and all werepurchased for our collection) and very little of a fish is wastedexcept the hardest parts. Walrus hide is sometimes cooked and eaten intimes of scarcity. Mollusks of any kind are rarely eaten, as it isdifficult to procure them. After a heavy gale in the autumn of 1881,when the beach was covered with marine animals, mostly lamellibranchmollusks with their shells and softer parts broken off by the violenceof the surf, we saw one woman collect a lapful of these “clam-heads,”which she said she was going to eat. The “blackskin” (epidermis) ofthe whale is considered a great delicacy by them, as by all the otherEskimo who are able to procure it, and they are also very fond of thetough white skin or gum round the roots of the whalebone.[N99]    [Footnote N98: The Eskimo of Iglulik “prefer venison to any kind    of meat.” Parry, 2d Voyage, p. 510.]    [Footnote N99: Compare Hooper, Tents, etc. “This, which the Tuski    call their sugar,” p. 174; and Hall, Arctic Researches, p. 132    (Baffin Land).]We saw and heard nothing of the habit so generally noticed among otherEskimo and in Siberia of eating the half-digested contents of thestomach of the reindeer, but we found that they were fond of the fæcestaken from the rectum of the deer. I find that this curious habit hasbeen noticed among Eskimo only in two other places--Greenland informer times and Boothia Felix. The Greenlanders ate “the Dung of theRein-deer, taken out of the Guts when they clean them; the Entrails ofPartridges and the like Out-cast, pass for Dainties with them.”[N100]The dung of the musk ox and reindeer when fresh were considered adelicacy by the Boothians, according to J. C. Ross.[N101] The entrailsof fowls are also considered a great delicacy and are carefully cookedas a separate dish.[N102]    [Footnote N100: Egede, Greenland, p. 136.]    [Footnote N101: Appendix to Ross’s 2d Voyage, p. xix.]    [Footnote N102: Compare the passage from Egede, just quoted, and    also Kumlien, Contributions, etc., p. 20, at Cumberland Gulf.]As far as our observations go these people eat little, if any, morefat than civilized man, and, as a rule, not by itself. Fat mayoccasionally be eaten (they are fond of the fat on the inside of duckskins), but they do not habitually eat the great quantities of blubberspoken of in some other places[N103] or drink oil, as the Hudson BayEskimo are said to do by Hall, or use it as a sauce for dry food, likethe natives of Norton Sound. It is usually supposed and generallystated in the popular accounts of the Eskimo that it is aphysiological necessity for them to eat enormous quantities of blubberin order to obtain a sufficient amount of carbon to enable them tomaintain their animal heat in the cold climate which they inhabit.A careful comparison, however, of the reports of actualobservers[N104] shows that an excessive eating of fat is not the rule,and is perhaps confined to the territory near Boothia Felix.    [Footnote N103: For instance, Schwatka says that the Nĕtcĭlĭk of    King William Land devour enormous quantities of seal blubber,    “noticeably more in summer than the other tribes,” viz, those of    the western shores of Hudson’s Bay (Science, vol. 4, p. 544).    Parry speaks of the natives of the Savage Islands, Hudson’s    Strait, eating raw blubber and sucking the oil remaining on the    skins they had emptied (2d Voyage, p. 14).]    [Footnote N104: See for example Egede’s Greenland, p. 134; Crantz,    History of Greenland, vol. 1, p. 144; Dall, Alaska, passim;    Hooper, Tents of the Tuski, p. 170; Nordenskiöld, Vega, p. 110.]Eggs of all kinds, except, of course, the smallest, are eagerly soughtfor, but the smaller birds are seldom eaten, as it is a waste of timeand ammunition to pursue them. We saw this people eat no vegetablesubstances, though they informed us that the buds of the willow weresometimes eaten. Of late years they have acquired a fondness for manykinds of civilized food, especially bread of any kind, flour, sugar,and molasses, and some of them are learning to like salt. They werevery glad to purchase from us corn-meal “mush” and the broken victualsfrom the table. These were, however, considered as special daintiesand eaten as luncheons or as a dessert after the regular meal. Thechildren and even some of the women were always on the watch for thecook’s slop bucket to be brought out, and vied with the ubiquitousdogs in searching for scraps of food. Meat which epicures would callrather “high” is eaten with relish, but they seem to prefer fresh meatwhen they can get it._Means of preparing food._--Food is generally cooked, except, perhaps,whale-skin and whale gum, which usually seem to be eaten as soon asobtained, without waiting for a fire. Meat of all kinds is generallyboiled in abundance of water over a fire of driftwood, and the broththus made is drunk hot before eating the meat. Fowls are prepared forboiling by skinning them. Fish are also boiled, but are often eatenraw, especially in winter at the deer-hunting camps, when they arefrozen hard. Meat is sometimes eaten raw or frozen. Lieut. Ray foundone family in camp on Kulugrua who had no fire of any kind, and wereeating everything raw. They had run out of oil some time before anddid not like to spend time in going to the coast for more while deerwere plentiful.When traveling in winter, according to Lieut. Ray, they prefer frozenfish or a sort of pemmican made as follows: The marrow is extractedfrom reindeer bones by boiling, and to a quantity of this is added 2or 3 pounds of crushed seal or whale blubber, and the whole beaten upwith the hands in a large wooden bowl to the consistency of frozencream. Into this they stir bits of boiled venison, generally thepoorer portions of the meat scraped off the bone, and chewed up smallby all the women and children of the family, “each using somecabalistic word as they cast in their mouthful.”[N105] The mass ismade up into 2-pound balls and carried in little sealskin bags. Flour,when obtained, is made into a sort of porridge, of which they are veryfond. Cooking is mostly done outside of the dwelling, in the open airin summer, or in kitchens opening out of the passageway in winter.Little messes only, like an occasional dish of soup or porridge, arecooked over the lamps in the house. This habit, of course, comes fromthe abundant supply of firewood, while the Eskimo most frequentlydescribed live in a country where wood is very scarce, and are obligedto depend on oil for fuel.    [Footnote N105: Lieut. Ray’s MS. notes.]_Time and frequency of eating._--When these people are living in thewinter houses they do not, as far as we could learn, have any regulartime for meals, but eat whenever they are hungry and have leisure. Thewomen seem to keep a supply of cooked food on hand ready for any oneto eat. When the men are working in the kû´dyĭgi, or “club house,” orwhen a number of them are encamped together in tents, as at thewhaling camp in 1883, or the regular summer camp at Pe´rnyû, the womenat intervals through the day prepare dishes of meat, which the men eatby themselves. When in the deer-hunting camps, according to Lieut.Ray, they eat but little in the morning, and can really be said totake no more than one full meal a day, which is eaten at night whenthe day’s work is done.[N106] When on the march they usually take afew mouthfuls of the pemmican above described before they start out inthe morning, and rarely touch food again till they go into camp atnight.    [Footnote N106: “They have no set Time for Meals, but every one    eats when he is hungry, except when they go to sea, and then their    chief Repast is a supper after they are come home in the Evening.”    (Egede, Greenland, p. 135. Compare also, Crantz, vol. 1, p. 145.)]When a family returns from the spring deer hunt with plenty of venisonthey usually keep open house for a day or two. The women of thehousehold, with sometimes the assistance of a neighbor or two, keepthe pot continually boiling, sending in dishes of meat at intervals,while the house is full of guests who stay for a short time, eating,smoking, and chatting, and then retire to make room for others. Messesare sometimes sent out to invalids who can not come to the feast. Onehousehold in the spring of 1883 consumed in this way two wholereindeer in 24 hours. They use only their hands and a knife in eatingmeat, usually filling the mouth and cutting or biting off themouthful. They are large eaters, some of them, especially the women,eating all the time when they have plenty, but we never saw them gorgethemselves in the manner described by Dr. Kane (2d Grinnell Exp.,passim) and other writers.Their habits of hospitality prevent their laying up any large supplyof meat, though blubber is carefully saved for commercial use, andthey depend for subsistence, almost from day to day, on their successin hunting. When encamped, however, in small parties in the summerthey often take more seals than they can consume. The carcasses ofthese, stripped of their skins and blubber, are buried in the gravelclose to the camp, and dug up and brought home when meat becomesscarce in the winter.DRINKS.The habitual drink is water, which these people consume in greatquantities when they can obtain it, and like to have very cold. In thewinter there is always a lump of clean snow on a rack close to thelamp, with a tub under it to catch the water that drips from it. Thisis replaced in the summer by a bucket of fresh water from some pond orlake. When the men are sitting in their open air clubs at the summercamps there is always a bucket of fresh water in the middle of thecircle, with a dipper to drink from. Hardly a native ever passed thestation without stopping for a drink of water, often drinking a quartof cold water at a time. When tramping about in the winter they eatlarge quantities of ice and snow, and on the march the women carrysmall canteens of sealskin, which they fill with snow and carry insideof their jackets, where the heat of the body melts the snow and keepsit liquid. This great fondness for plenty of cold water has been oftennoticed among the Eskimo elsewhere, and appears to be quitecharacteristic of the race.[N107] They have acquired a taste forliquor, and like to get enough to produce intoxication. As well as wecould judge, they are easily affected by alcohol. Some of them duringour stay learned to be very fond of coffee, “ka´fe,” but tea they arehardly acquainted with, though they will drink it. I have noticed thatthey sometimes drank the water produced by the melting of the sea icealong the beach, and pronounced it excellent when it was so brackishthat I found it quite undrinkable.    [Footnote N107: See, for instance, Egede: “Their Drink is nothing    but Water” (Greenland, p. 134), and, “Furthermore, they put great    Lumps of Ice and Snow into the Water they drink, to make it cooler    for to quench their Thirst” (p. 135). “Their drink is clear water,    which stands in the house in a great copper vessel, or in a wooden    tub. * * * They bring in a supply of fresh water every day * * *    and that their water may be cool they choose to lay a piece of ice    or a little snow in it” * * * (Crantz, vol. 1, p. 144). Compare,    also, Parry, 2d voy., p. 506, where the natives of Iglulik are    said to drink a great deal of water, which they get by melting    snow, and like very cold. The same fondness for water was observed    by Nordenskiöld in Siberia (Vega, vol. 2, p. 114).]NARCOTICS.The only narcotic in use among these people is tobacco, which theyobtain directly or indirectly from the whites, and which has been inuse among them from the earliest time when we have any knowledge ofthem. When Mr. Elson, in the _Blossom’s_ barge, visited Point Barrow,in 1826, he found tobacco in general use and the most marketablearticle.[N108] This undoubtedly came from the Russians by way ofSiberia and Bering Strait, as Kotzebue found the natives of the soundwhich bears his name, who were in communication with the Asiatic coastby way of the Diomedes, already addicted to the use of tobacco in1816. It is not probable that tobacco was introduced on the Arcticcoast by way of the Russian settlements in Alaska. There were noRussian posts north of Bristol Bay until 1833, when St. Michael’sRedoubt was built. When Capt. Cook visited Bristol Bay, in 1778, hefound that tobacco was not used there,[N109] while in Norton Sound,the same year, the natives “had no dislike to tobacco.”[N110] Neitherwas it introduced from the English posts in the east, as Franklinfound the “Kûñmû´dlĭñ” not in the habit of using it--“The westernEsquimaux use tobacco, and some of our visitors had smoked it, butthought the flavor very disagreeable,”[N111]--nor had they adopted thehabit in 1837.[N112]    [Footnote N108: Beechey, Voyage, p. 308.]    [Footnote N109: Third Voyage, vol. 2, p. 437.]    [Footnote N110: Ibid, 2, p. 479.]    [Footnote N111: Second Exp., p. 130.]    [Footnote N112: See T. Simpson, Narrative, p. 156.]When the _Plover_ wintered at Point Barrow, according to Dr. Simpson’saccount,[N113] all the tobacco, except a little obtained from theEnglish discovery ships, came from Asia and was brought by theNunatañmiun. At present the latter bring very little if any tobacco,and the supply is obtained directly from the ships, though a littleoccasionally finds its way up the coast from the southwest.    [Footnote N113: Op. cit., pp. 235, 236, 266.]They use all kinds of tobacco, but readily distinguish and desire thesorts considered better by the whites. For instance, they were eagerto get the excellent quality of “Navy” tobacco furnished by theCommissary Department, while one of our party who had a large quantityof exceedingly bad fine-cut tobacco could hardly give it away.A little of the strong yellow “Circassian” tobacco used by theRussians for trading is occasionally brought up from the southwest,and perhaps also by the Nunatañmiun, and is very highly prized,probably because it was in this form that they first saw tobacco.Snuff seems to be unknown; tobacco is used only for chewing andsmoking. The habit of chewing tobacco is almost universal. Men, women,and even children, though the latter be but 2 or 3 years old andunweaned,[N114] when tobacco is to be obtained, keep a “chew,” oftenof enormous size, constantly in the mouth. The juice is not spit out,but swallowed with the saliva, without producing any signs of nausea.The tobacco is chewed by itself and not sweetened with sugar, as wasobserved by Hooper and Nordenskiöld among the “Chukches.”[N115] I knewbut two adult Eskimo in Utkiavwĭñ who did not chew tobacco, and one ofthese adopted the habit to a certain extent while we were there.    [Footnote N114: Compare J. Simpson, op. cit., p. 250, and    Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2, p. 116.]    [Footnote N115: Tents, etc., p. 83; Vega, vol. 2, p. 116.]Tobacco is smoked in pipes of a peculiar pattern called kui´nyɐ, ofwhich the collection contains a series of ten specimens.Of these, No. 89288 [705],[N116] figured in Ray’s Point Barrow Report,Ethnology, Pl. I, Fig. 1, will serve as a type. The bowl is of brass,neatly inlaid on the upper surface with a narrow ring of copper closeto the edge, from which run four converging lines, 90° apart, nearlyto the center. Round the under surface are also three concentric ringsof copper. The wooden stem appears to be willow or birch, and is intwo longitudinal sections, held together by the lashing of sealskinthong which serves to attach the bowl to the stem. This lashing wasevidently put on wet and allowed to shrink on, and the ends aresecured by tucking under the turns. The whipping at the mouthpiece isof fine sinew thread. A picker of steel for cleaning out the bowl isattached to the stem by a piece of seal thong, the end of which iswedged under the turns of the lashing. The remaining pipes are all ofthe same general pattern, but vary in the material of the bowl and indetails of execution. The stems are always of the same material andput together in the same way, but are sometimes lozenge-shaped insteadof elliptical in section. The lashing is sometimes of three-ply sinewbraid. The bowl shows the greatest variation, both in form andmaterial.    [Footnote N116: The numbers first given are those of the National    Museum; the numbers in brackets are those of the collector.]Fig. 6_a_ (No. 56737 [10], from Utkiavwĭñ) has an iron bowl,noticeable for the ornamentation of the shank. The metal work has allbeen done with the file except the fitting of the saucer to the shank.This has evidently been heated and shrunk on. Three pipes have bowlsof smoothly ground stone. No. 89289 [1582] (Fig. 6_b_ from Utkiavwĭñ)is of rather soft greenish gray slate. No. 89290 [864] is of the sameshape, but of hard greenish stone, while the third stone pipe(No. 89291 [834], from Utkiavwĭñ), of gray slate, is of quite adifferent pattern. Three of the series have bowls of reindeer antler,lined with thin sheet brass, and one a bowl of walrus ivory, linedwith thin copper. (See Fig. 6_c_, Nos. 89285 [954], 89286 [915], and89287 [1129].)  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Pipes: _a_, pipe with metal bowl; _b_, pipe  with stone bowl; _c_, pipe bowl of antler or ivory. 1/3]Antler and stone pipes of this pattern and rather small are usuallycarried by the men out of doors, while the more elaborate metal pipes,which are often very large and handsome (I have seen some with asaucer at least 3 inches in diameter) are more frequently used in thehouse and by the women. The stem is usually 1 foot or 13 inches long,though pipes at least 18 inches long were seen.To most pipes are attached pickers, as in the type specimen. Thepicker is in all cases of metal, usually iron or steel, but sometimesof copper (see the pickers attached to pipes above). When not in usethe point is tucked under the lashing on the stem. The pipes arereadily taken apart for cleaning.No. 89292 [1752] (Fig. 7) is an extemporized pipe made in a hurry by aman who wished to smoke, but had no pipe.  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Pipe made of willow stick. 1/3]It is simply a rough willow stick, slightly whittled into shape, splitand hollowed out like a pipestem. It is held together by a whipping ofsinew thread and a lashing of deerskin thong, fastened by a slip-knotat one end, the other being tucked in as usual. A small funnel-shapedhole at one end serves for a bowl, and shows by its charred surfacethat it has been actually used. This pipe was bought from one of the“Nunatañmiun,” who were in camp at Pernyû in 1883, and shows itsinland origin in the use of the deerskin thong. A coast native wouldhave used seal thong.The pipe is carried at the girdle, either with the stem thrust insidethe breeches or in a bag attached to the belt. No. 56744 [55](Utkiavwĭñ) is the only specimen of pipe bag in the collection. It isa long, narrow, cylindric bag, made of four white ermine skins, withtwo hind legs and two tails forming a fringe round the bottom, whichis of dressed deerskin, in one piece, flesh side out. The band roundthe mouth is of gray deerskin, running only two-thirds of the wayround. The piece which fills the remaining third runs out into thestrap for fastening the bag to the belt. The ornamental strips on twoof the longitudinal seams and round the bottom are of deerskin. Theseams are all sewed “over and over” on the “wrong” side with sinewthread. This is an unusually handsome bag.Tobacco is carried in a small pouch of fur attached to the girdle, andtucked inside of the breeches, or sometimes worn under the jacket,slung round the neck by a string or the necklace. The collectioncontains three of these, of which No. 89803 [889] (Fig. 8_a_) willserve as a typical specimen.It is made by sewing together two pieces of wolverine fur, hair out,of the same shape and size, and round the mouth of this a band ofshort-haired light-colored deerskin, also hair out, with the endsmeeting at one side in a seam corresponding to one of the seams of thewolverine fur. The mouth is ornamented with a narrow band of wolverinefur, the flesh side, which is colored red, turned out. It is closed bya piece of seal thong about 5 inches long, one end of which is sewedto the middle of the seam in the deerskin band and the other passedthrough a large blue glass bead and knotted. This string is wound twoor three times round the neck of the bag, and the bight of it tuckedunder the turns. The seams are all sewed “over and over” on the“wrong” side with sinew thread.  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Tobacco pouches. 1/4]These tobacco pouches are usually of a similar pattern, often slightlynarrowed at the neck, and generally fringed round the mouth with anarrow strip of wolverine fur as above. They are often ornamented withtags of wolverine fur on the seams (as in No. 89804 [1341, Fig.8_b_]), and borders of different colored skin. No. 89805 [1350] isvery elaborately ornamented. It is made of brown deerskin, trimmedwith white deerskin clipped close and bordered with narrow braids ofblue and red worsted, and little tags of the latter. According to Dr.Simpson,[N117] these bags are called “del-la-mai´-yu.” We neglected toobtain the proper names for them, as we always made use of the linguafranca “tiba´ púksak,” bag for tiba´ (tobacco). No. 89903 [889]contains a specimen of tobacco as prepared for smoking by the Eskimo.This consists of common black Cavendish or “Navy” tobacco, cut up veryfine, and mixed with finely chopped wood in the proportion of abouttwo parts of tobacco to one of wood. We were informed that willowtwigs were used for this purpose. Perhaps this may have some slightaromatic flavor, as well as serving to make the tobacco go further,though I did not recognize any such flavor in some tobacco from anEskimo’s pouch that I once smoked and found exceedingly bad. The smellof an Eskimo’s pipe is different from any other tobacco smoke and isvery disagreeable. It has some resemblance to the smell of some of thecheaper brands of North Carolina tobacco which are known to beadulterated with other vegetable substances. The method of smoking isas follows: After clearing out the bowl with the picker, a little wadof deer hair, plucked from the clothes in some inconspicuous place,generally the front skirt of the inner jacket, is rammed down to thebottom of the bowl. This is to prevent the fine tobacco from gettinginto the stem and clogging it up. The bowl is then filled withtobacco, of which it only holds a very small quantity. The mouthpieceis placed between the lips, the tobacco ignited, and all smoked out intwo or three strong inhalations. The smoke is very deeply inhaled andallowed to pass out slowly from the mouth and nostrils, bringing tearsto the eyes, often producing giddiness, and almost always a violentfit of coughing. I have seen a man almost prostrated from the effectsof a single pipeful. This method of smoking has been in vogue sincethe time of our first acquaintance with these people.[N118]    [Footnote N117: Op. cit., p. 243.]    [Footnote N118: See T. Simpson: “Not content with chewing and    smoking it, they swallowed the fumes till they became sick, and    seemed to revel in a momentary intoxication.” Point Barrow (1837),    Narrative, p. 156. Also Kotzebue: “They chew, snuff, smoke, and    even swallow the smoke.” Kotzebue Sound (1816) Voyage, vol. 1,    p. 237. Beechey also describes the people of Hotham Inlet in 1826    as smoking in the manner above described, obtaining the hair from    a strip of dogskin tied to the pipe. Their tobacco was mixed with    wood. Voyage, p. 300. Petitot (Monographie, etc., p. xxix)    describes a precisely similar method of smoking among the    Mackenzie Eskimos. Their tobacco was “melangé à de la ráclure de    saule” and the pipe was called “kwiñeρk.” (Vocabulaire, p. 54).]Though they smoke little at a time, they smoke frequently when tobaccois plentiful. Of late years, since tobacco has become plentiful, somehave adopted white men’s pipes, which they smoke without inhaling, andthey are glad to get cigars, and, since our visit, cigarettes. Inconversation with us they usually called all means for smoking“pai´pa,” the children sometimes specifying “pai´pa-sigya´” (cigar) or“mûkparapai´pa,” paper-pipe (cigarette). The use of the kui´nyɐ, whichname appears to be applied only to the native pipes, seems to beconfined to the adults. We knew of no children owning them, thoughtheir parents made no objection to their chewing tobacco or owning orusing clay or wooden pipes which they obtained from us. They carrytheir fondness for tobacco so far that they will even eat the fouloily refuse from the bottom of the bowl, the smallest portion of whichwould produce nausea in a white man. This habit has been observed atPlover Bay, Siberia.[N119] Tobacco ashes are also eaten, probably forthe sake of the potash they contain, as one of the men at Utkiavwīñwas fond of carbonate of soda, which he told the doctor was just likewhat he got from his pipe. Pipes of this type, differing in details,but all agreeing in having very small bowls, frequently of metal, andsome contrivance for opening the stem, are used by the Eskimo from atleast as far south as the Yukon delta (as shown by the collections inthe National Museum) to the Anderson River and Cape Bathurst,[N120]and have even been adopted by the Indians of the Yukon, who learnedthe use of tobacco from the Eskimo. They are undoubtedly of Siberianorigin, as will be seen by comparing the figure of a “Chukch” pipe inNordenskiöld’s Vega, vol. 2, p. 117, Fig. 7, and the figure of aTunguse pipe in Seebohm’s “Siberia in Asia” (p. 149), with the pipesfigured from our collection. Moreover, the method of smoking isprecisely that practiced in Siberia, even to the proportion of woodmixed with the tobacco.[N121]    [Footnote N119: See Hooper, Tents, etc., p. 177, and Dall, Alaska,    p. 81.]    [Footnote N120: This is an interesting fact, as it shows that the    Eskimo from Demarcation Point east learned to smoke from the    people of Point Barrow, and not from the English or the northern    Indians, who use pipes “modeled after the clay pipes of the Hudson    Bay Company.” (Dall, Alaska, p. 81, Fig. _A_.) They acquired the    habit some time between 1837, when T. Simpson found them ignorant    of the use of tobacco (see reference above, p. 65), and 1849, when    they were glad to receive it from Pullen and Hooper. (Tents, etc.,    p. 258.) Petitot (Monographie, etc., p. xxvi) states that the    Eskimo of the Mackenzie informed him that the use of tobacco and    the form of the pipe, with blue beads, labrets, and other things,    came through the neighbors from a distant land called    “Nate´ρovik,” which he supposes to mean St. Michaels, but which,    from the evidence of other travelers, is much more likely to mean    Siberia.    The Eskimo geography, on which Fr. Petitot relies so strongly, is    extremely vague west of Barter Island, and savors of the fabulous    almost as much as the Point Barrow stories about the eastern    natives. The evidence which leads Fr. Petitot to believe    “Nate´ρovik” to be St. Michaels is rather peculiar. The Mackenzie    natives call the people who are nearest to Nate´ρovik on the north    “the Sedentary.” Now, the people who live nearest to St. Michaels    on the north are the “Sedentary American Tchukatchīs”(!);    therefore Nate´ρovik is probably St. Michaels. (“Le nom    _Natéρovik_ semble convenir à l’ancien fort russe Michaëlowski, en    ce que la tribu iunok la plus voisine de ce poste, vers le nord,    est désignée par nos Tchiglit sous le nom d’ _Apkwam-méut_ ou de    Sédentaires; or telle est la position géographique qui convient    aux sédentaires Tchukatches américains, dont la limite la plus    septentrionale, selon le capitaine Beechey, est la pointe    Barrow.”) A slight acquaintance with the work of Dall and other    modern explorers in this region would have saved Fr. Petitot from    this and some other errors.]    [Footnote N121: See Wrangell, Narrative of an Expedition, etc.,    p. 58. “The Russians here [at Kolymsk, 1820] smoke in the manner    common to all the people of northern Asia; they draw in the    tobacco smoke, swallow it, and allow it to escape again by the    nose and ears(!).” The tobacco is said to be mixed with “finely    powdered larch wood, to make it go further” (ibid.). See also    Hooper, Tents, etc.: “Generally, I believe, about one-third part    of wood is used” (pp. 176 and 177; and Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2,    p. 116.)]The consideration of the question whence the Siberians acquired thispeculiar method of smoking would lead me beyond the bounds of thepresent work, but I can not leave the subject of pipes without callingattention to the fact that Nordenskiöld[N122] has alluded to theresemblance of these to the Japanese pipes. A gentleman who has spentmany years in China also informs me that the Chinese pipes are of avery similar type and smoked in much the same way.[N123] TheGreenlanders and eastern Eskimo generally, who have learned the use oftobacco directly from the Europeans, use large-bowled pipes, whichthey smoke in the ordinary manner. In talking with us the people ofPoint Barrow call tobacco “tiba´” or “tibakĭ,” but among themselves itis still known as ta´wak, which is the word found in use among them bythe earliest explorers.[N124] “Tiba” was evidently learned from theAmerican whalers, as it was not in use in Dr. Simpson’s time. It ismerely an attempt to pronounce the word tobacco, but has been adoptedinto the Eskimo language sufficiently to be used as the radical incompound words such as “tiba´xutikă´ktûñɐ,” “I have a supply oftobacco.” There is no evidence that anything else was smoked beforethe introduction of tobacco, and no pipes seen or collected appearolder than the time when we know them to have had tobacco.[N125]    [Footnote N122: Vega, vol. 2, p. 116.]    [Footnote N123: See also Petitot, Monographie, etc., p. xxix.]    [Footnote N124: See Beechey, Voyage, p. 323; T. Simpson,    Narrative, p. 156--“tobacco, which * * * they call tawāc, or    tawākh, a name acquired of course from Russian traders;” Hooper,    Tents, etc., p. 239; also Maguire and J. Simpson, loc. cit.    passim. Petitot calls ta´wak “mot français corrompu”!]    [Footnote N125: Since the above was written, the word for pipe,    “kuinyɐ,” has been found to be of Siberian origin. See the    writer’s article “On the Siberian origin of some customs of the    Western Eskimos” (American Anthropologist, vol. 1, pp. 325-336).]HABITATIONS._The winter house_ (_ĭ´glu_).--The permanent winter houses are builtof wood[N126] and thickly covered with clods of earth. Each houseconsists of a single room, nearly square, entered by an undergroundpassage about 25 feet long and 4 to 4½ feet high. The sloping mound ofearth which covers the house, grading off insensibly to the level ofthe ground, gives the houses the appearance of being underground,especially as the land on which they stand is irregular and hilly.Without very careful measurements, which we were unable to make, it isimpossible to tell whether the floor is above or below the surface ofthe ground. It is certainly not very far either way. I am inclined tothink that a space at or near the top of a hillock is simply leveledto receive the floor. In this case the back of the house on a hillside, like some in Utkiavwĭñ, would be underground.    [Footnote N126: In some of the older houses, the ruins of which    are still to be seen at the southwest end of the village of    Utkiavwĭñ, whales’ bones were used for timbers. Compare Lyon    Journal, p. 171, where the winter huts at Iglulik are described as    “entirely constructed of the bones of whales, unicorns, walruses,    and smaller animals,” with the interstices filled with earth and    moss.]  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Plans of Eskimo-winter house.]The passage is entered at the farther end by a vertical shaft about 6feet deep in the center of a steep mound of earth. Round the mouth isa square frame or combing of wood, and blocks of wood are placed inthe shaft to serve as steps. One or two houses in Utkiavwĭñ had ship’scompanion ladders in the shaft. This entrance can be closed with apiece of walrus hide or a wooden cover in severe weather or when thefamily is away. The passage is about 4 feet wide and the sides androof are supported by timbers of whalebone. On the right hand near theinner end is a good-sized room opening from the passage, which has awooden roof covered with earth, forming a second small mound close tothe house, with a smoke hole in the middle, and serves as a kitchen,while various dark and irregular recesses on the other side serve asstorerooms. The passage is always icy and dark.  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Interior of iglu, looking toward door.]At the inner end of the passage a circular trapdoor in the floor opensinto the main room of the house, close to the wall at the middle ofone end. The floor is at such a height from the bottom of the tunnelthat a man standing erect in the tunnel has his head and shoulders inthe room. These rooms vary somewhat in dimensions, but are generallyabout 12 or 14 feet long and 8 or 10 feet wide. The floor, walls, androof are made of thick planks of driftwood, dressed smooth and neatlyfitted together, edge to edge. The ridgepole runs across the house andthe roof slopes toward each end. The two slopes are unequal, thefront, or that towards the entrance, being considerably the longer.The walls are vertical, those at the ends being between 3 and 4 feethigh, while the sides run up to 6 or 7 feet at the ridgepole. The wallplanks run up and down, and those of the roof from the ridge to theends of the house, where there is a stout horizontal timber. In somehouses the walls are made of paneled bulkheads from some wreckedwhaler.  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Interior of iglu, looking toward bench.]In the front of the house over the trapdoor there are no planks for aspace of about 2 feet. The lower part of this space is filled in withshort transverse beams, so as to leave a square hole close to theridge. This hole has a stout transverse beam at the top and bottom andserves as a window. When the house is occupied it is covered by atranslucent membrane made of strips of seal entrail sewed together andstretched over two arched sticks of light wood--whalebone was used inDr. Simpson’s time[N127]--running diagonally across from corner tocorner. The window is closed with a wooden shutter when the house isshut up in winter, but both apertures are left open in summer. Justabove the window, close to the ridgepole, is a little aperture forventilation. Across the back of the room runs a platform or banquette,about 30 inches high in front and sloping back a little, which servesas a sleeping and lounging place. It is about 5 feet wide, and thefront edge comes nearly under the ridgepole. It is made of thickplanks running across the house, and supported at each end by ahorizontal beam, the end of which projects somewhat beyond the benchand is supported by a round post. At each side of the house stands alamp, and over these are suspended racks in the shape of small laddersfor drying clothing,[N128] etc. Deerskin blankets for the bed, whichare rolled up and put under the bench when not in use, and a number ofwooden tubs of various sizes--I counted nine tubs and buckets in onehouse in Utkiavwĭñ--complete the furniture.    [Footnote N127: Op. cit., p. 256.]    [Footnote N128: Compare Hooper, Tents, etc., p. 46: “Small lattice    shelves * * * on which moccasins * * * are put to dry.” Plover    Bay. See also plate to face p. 160 Parry’s Second Voyage.]Two families usually occupy such a house, in which case each wife hasher own end of the room and her own lamp, near which on the floor sheusually sits to work. Some houses contain but one family and othersmore. I knew one house in Utkiavwĭñ whose regular occupants werethirteen in number, namely, a father with his wife and adopteddaughter, two married sons each with a wife and child, his widowedsister with her son and his wife, and one little girl. This house wasalso the favorite stopping-place for people who came down from Nuwŭkto spend the night. The furniture is always arranged in the same way.There is only one rack on the right side of the house and two on theleft. Of these the farther from the lamp is the place for the lump ofsnow. In this same corner are kept the tubs, and the large generalchamber pot and the small male urinal are near the trap door. Dishesof cooked meat are also kept in this corner. This leaves the othercorner of the house vacant for women visitors, who sit there and sew.Male visitors, as well as the men of the house when they have nothingto do, usually sit on the edge of the banquette.In sleeping they usually lie across the banquette with their feet tothe wall, but sometimes, when there are few people in the house, lielengthwise, and occasionally sleep on the floor under the banquette.Petitot says that in the Mackenzie region only married people sleepwith their heads toward the edge of the banquette. Children andvisitors lie with their heads the other way.[N129] (See Fig. 9, groundplan and section of house, and Figs. 10 and 11, interior, fromsketches by the writer. For outside see Fig. 12, from a photograph byLieut. Ray).    [Footnote N129: Monographie, etc., p. xxiii.]At the back of the house is a high oblong scaffolding, made by settingup tall poles of driftwood, four, six, or eight in number, andfastening on cross pieces about 8 or 10 feet from the ground, usuallyin two tiers, of which the lower supports the frames of the kaiaks andthe upper spears and other bulky property. Nothing except very heavyarticles, such as sledges, boxes, and barrels, is ever left on theground. A man can easily reach this scaffold from the top of thehouse, but it is high enough to be out of reach of the dogs. The crosspieces are usually supported on crotches made by lashing the lower jawof a walrus to the pole, so that one ramus lies along the latter.Scaffolds of this sort, usually spoken of as “caches” or “cacheframes,” are of necessity used among the Eskimos generally, as it isthe only way in which they can protect their bulky property.[N130]    [Footnote N130: See for instance, Crantz, History of Greenland,    vol. 1, p. 141; Franklin, 1st Exped., vol. 2, p. 194 (Coppermine    River); 2d Exped., p. 121 (Mouth of the Mackenzie, where they are    made of drift logs stuck up so that the roots serve as crotches to    hold the cross pieces); Hooper, Tents, etc., pp. 48, 228, and 343    (Plover Bay, Point Barrow, and Toker Point); J. Simpson, op. cit.,    p. 256 (Point Barrow); Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2, p. 92    (Pitlekaj).]Around Norton Sound, however, they use a more elaborate structure,consisting of a regular little house 6 feet square, raised 6 to 10feet from the ground on four posts.[N131]    [Footnote N131: Dall, Alaska, p. 13.]Belonging to each household, and usually near the house, are lowscaffolds for the large boats, rows of posts for stretching lines ofthong, and one or more small cellars or underground rooms framed withwhales’ bones, the skull being frequently used for a roof, which serveas storehouses for blubber. These may be called “blubber rooms.”  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--House in Utkiavwĭñ.]These winter houses can only be occupied when the weather is coldenough to keep the ground hard frozen. During the summer thepassageways are full of water, which freezes at the beginning ofwinter and is dug out with a pickax. The people of Utkiavwĭñ began tocome to us to borrow our pickax to clean out their iglus aboutSeptember 24, 1882, and all the houses were vacated before July 1,both seasons.This particular form of winter house, though in general like thosebuilt by other Eskimo, nevertheless differs in many respects from anydescribed elsewhere. For instance, the Greenland house was an oblongflat-roofed building of turf and stones, with the passageway in themiddle of one side instead of one end, and not underground. Still, thedoor and windows were all on one side, and the banquette or “brix”only on the side opposite the entrance. The windows were formerly madeof seal entrails, and the passage, though not underground, was stilllower than the floor of the house, so that it was necessary to step upat each end.[N132]    [Footnote N132: Egede, Greenland, p. 114; Crantz, History of    Greenland, vol. 1, p. 139; Rink, Tales and Traditions, p. 7.]A detailed description of the peculiar communal house of the EastGreenlanders, of which, there is only one at each village, will befound in Capt. Holm’s paper in the Geografisk Tidskrift, vol. 8, pp.87-89. This is the long house of West Greenland, still furtherelongated till it will accommodate “half a score of families, that isto say, 30 to 50 people.” John Davis (1586) describes the houses ofthe Greenlanders “neere the Sea side,” which were made with pieces ofwood on both sides, and crossed over with poles and then covered overwith earth.[N133]    [Footnote N133: Hakluyt, Voyages, etc. (1589), p. 788.]  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Ground plan and section of winter house in  Mackenzie region.]At Iglulik the permanent houses were dome shaped, built of bones, withthe interstices filled with turf, and had a short, low passage.[N134]No other descriptions of permanent houses are to be found until wereach the people of the Mackenzie region, who build houses of timbers,of rather a peculiar pattern, covered with turf, made in the form of across, of which three or all four of the arms are the sleeping rooms,the floor being raised into a low banquette.[N135] (See Fig. 13.)Petitot[N136] gives a very excellent detailed description of thehouses of the Anderson River people. According to his account thepassageway is built up of blocks of ice. He mentions one house with asingle alcove like those at Point Barrow.[N137]    [Footnote N134: Lyon, Journal, p. 171.]    [Footnote N135: See Fig. 13, ground plan and section, copied from    Petitot, Monographie, etc., p. XXIII.]    [Footnote N136: Monographie, etc., p. XXI.]    [Footnote N137: See also Franklin, 2d Exped., p. 121 (Mouth of the    Mackenzie), and pp. 215 and 216 (Atkinson Island, Richardson.    A ground plan and section closely resembling Petitot’s are given    here); and Hooper, Tents, etc., p. 243 (Toker Point).]We have no description of the houses at the villages between PointBarrow and Kotzebue Sound, but at the latter place was found the largetriple house described by Dr. Simpson, and compared by him with thatdescribed by Richardson, though in some respects it more closelyresembles those seen by Hooper.[N138] This house really has afireplace in the middle, and in this approaches the houses of thesouthern Eskimo of Alaska. According to Dr. Simpson,[N139]“a modification of the last form, built of undressed timber, andsometimes of very small dimensions, with two recesses opposite eachother, and raised a foot above the middle space, is very common on theshores of Kotzebue Sound,” but he does not make it plain whetherhouses like those used at Point Barrow are not used there also.    [Footnote N138: See ante.]    [Footnote N139: Op. cit., p. 258.]This form of house is very like the large snow houses seen by Lieut.Ray at hunting camps on Kulugrua. Dr. Simpson describes less permanentstructures which are used on the rivers, consisting of small treessplit and laid “inclining inward in a pyramidal form towards a rudesquare frame in the center, supported by two or more upright posts.Upon these the smaller branches of the felled trees are placed, andthe whole, except the aperture at the top and a small opening on oneside, is covered with earth or only snow.”[N139b] These buildings, andespecially the temporary ones described by Dr. Simpson, used on theNunatak, probably gave rise to the statement we heard at Point Barrowthat “the people south had no iglus and lived only in tents.” Thehouses at Norton Sound are quite different from the Point Barrow form.The floor, which is not planked, is 3 or 4 feet under ground, and thepassage enters one side of the house, instead of coming up through thefloor, and a small shed is built over the outer entrance to thepassage. The fire is built in the middle of the house, under theaperture in the roof which serves for chimney and window, and there isseldom any banquette, but the two ends of the room are fenced off bylogs laid on the ground, to serve as sleeping places, straw and spruceboughs being laid down and covered with grass mats.[N140]    [Footnote N139b: Op. cit., p. 258.]    [Footnote N140: Dall, Alaska, pp. 13 and 14, diagram on p. 13.]The houses in the Kuskokwim region are quite similar to those justdescribed, but are said to be built above ground in the interior,though thy are still covered with sods.[N141] There are no publishedaccounts of the houses of the St. Lawrence islanders, but they areknown to inhabit subterranean or partly underground earth-coveredhouses, built of wood, while the Asiatic Eskimo have abandoned the oldunderground houses, which were still in use at the end of the lastcentury, and have adopted the double-skin tent of the Chukches.[N142]In addition to the cases quoted by Dall, Capt. Cook speaks of findingthe natives of St. Lawrence Bay in 1778 living in partly undergroundearth-covered houses.[N143]    [Footnote N141: Petroff, Report, etc., p. 15.]    [Footnote N142: See Dall, Cont. to N. A. Ethn., vol. 1, p. 105.    Mr. E. W. Nelson tells me, however, that the village at East Cape,    Siberia, is composed of real iglus.]    [Footnote N143: Third Voyage, vol. 2, p. 450.]_Arrangement in villages._--The village of Utkiavwĭñ occupies a narrowstrip of ground along the edge of the cliffs of Cape Smyth, about1,000 yards long, and extending some 150 yards inland. The houses arescattered among the hillocks without any attempt at regularity and atdifferent distances from each other, sometimes alone, and sometimes ingroups of two contiguous houses, which often have a common cacheframe. Nuwŭk, from Dr. Simpson’s account[N144] and what we saw in ourhurried visits, is scattered in the same way over the knolls of PointBarrow, but has its greatest extension in an east and west direction.From Simpson’s account (ibid.) double houses appear more common atNuwŭk than at Utkiavwĭñ, and he even speaks of a few threefold ones.All the houses agree in facing south. This is undoubtedly to admit thegreatest amount of light in winter, and seems to be a tolerablygeneral custom, at least among the northern Eskimo.[N145]    [Footnote N144: Op. cit., p. 256.]    [Footnote N145: For example, I find it mentioned in Greenland by    Kane, 1st Grinnell Exp., p. 40; at Iglulik by Parry, 2d Voy.,    p. 499; and at the mouth of the Mackenzie by Franklin, 2d Exp.,    p. 121, as well as by Dr. Simpson at Nuwŭk, op. cit., p. 256.]The custom of having the dwelling face south appears to be a deeplyrooted one, as even the tents in summer all face the same way.[N146]    [Footnote N146: Frobisher says the tents in Meta Incognita    (in 1577) were “so pitched up, that the entrance into them, is    alwaies South, or against the Sunne.” Hakluyt’s Voyages, etc.,    (1589) p. 628.]The tents on the sandspit at Plover Bay all face west. The same wasobserved by the Krause brothers at East Cape.[N147] At Utkiavwĭñ thereare twenty-six or twenty-seven inhabited houses. The uninhabited aremostly ruins and are chiefly at the southwest end of the village,though the breaking away of the cliffs at the other end has exposedthe ruins of a few other old houses. Near these are also the ruins ofthe buildings destroyed by the ice catastrophe described above(p. 31). The mounds at the site of the United States signal stationare also the ruins of old iglus. We were told that “long ago,” beforethey had any iron, five families who “talked like dogs” inhabited thisvillage. They were called Isû´tkwamiun. Similar mounds are to be seenat Pernyû, near the present summer camp. About these we only learnedthat people lived there “long ago.” We also heard of ruined houses onthe banks of Kulugrua.    [Footnote N147: Geographische Blätter, vol. 5, p. 27.]Besides the dwellings there are in Utkiavwĭñ three and in Nuwŭk two ofthe larger buildings used for dancing, and as workrooms for the men,so often spoken of among other Eskimo.Dr. Simpson states[N148] that they are nominally the property of someof the more wealthy men. We did not hear of this, nor did we ever hearthe different buildings distinguished as “So-and-so’s,” as I aminclined to think would have been the case had the custom stillprevailed. They are called kû´dyĭgi or kû´drĭgi (karrigi of Simpson),a word which corresponds, mutatis mutandis, with the Greenlandickagsse, which means, first, a circle of hills round a small deepvalley, and then a circle of people who sit close together (and then,curiously enough, a brothel). At Utkiavwĭñ they are situated about themiddle of the village, one close to the bank and the others at theother edge of the village. They are built like the other houses, butare broader than long, with the ridgepole in the middle, so that thetwo slopes of the roof are equal, and are not covered with turf, likethe dwellings, being only partially banked up with earth.    [Footnote N148: Op. cit., p. 259.]The one visited by Lieut. Ray on the occasion of the “tree dance” was16 by 20 feet and 7 feet high under the ridge, and held sixty people.In the fall and spring, when it is warm enough to sit in the kû´dyĭgiwithout fire and with the window open, it is used as a generallounging place or club room by the men. Those who have carpenteringand similar work to do bring it there and others come simply to loungeand gossip and hear the latest news, as the hunters when they come ingenerally repair to the kû´dyĭgi as soon as they have put away theirequipments.They are so fond of this general resort that when nearly the wholevillage was encamped at Imêkpûñ in the spring of 1883, to be near thewhaling ground, they extemporized a club house by arranging fourtimbers large enough for seats in a hollow square near the middle ofthe camp. The men take turns in catering for the club, each man’s wifefurnishing and cooking the food for the assembled party when herhusband’s turn comes. The club house, however, is not used as asleeping place for the men of the village, as it is said to be in theterritory south of Bering Strait,[N149] nor as a hotel for visitors,as in the Norton Sound region.[N150] Visitors are either entertainedin some dwelling or build temporary snow huts for themselves.    [Footnote N149: Petroff, Report, etc., p. 128.]    [Footnote N150: Dall, Alaska, p. 16.]The kû´dyĭgi is not used in the winter, probably on account of thedifficulty of warming it, except on the occasions of the dances,festivals, or conjuring ceremonies. Crevices in the walls are thencovered with blocks of snow, a slab of transparent ice is fitted intothe window, and the house is lighted and heated with lamps. Buildingsof this sort and used for essentially the same purposes have beenobserved among nearly all known Eskimo, except the Greenlanders, who,however, still retain the tradition of such structures.[N151] Even theSiberian Eskimo, who have abandoned the iglu, still retained thekû´dyĭgi until a recent date at least, as Hooper saw at Oong-wy-sac aperformance in a “large tent, apparently erected for and devoted topublic purposes (possibly as a council room as well as a theater, forin place of the usual inner apartments only a species of bench ofraised earth ran round it).”[N152] These buildings are numerous andparticularly large and much used south of Bering Strait, where theyare also used as steam bath houses.[N153]    [Footnote N151: See Rink, Tales and Traditions, p. 8; also    Geografisk Tidskrift, vol. 8, p. 141. Speaking of buildings of    this sort, Dr. Rink says: “Men i Grønland kjendes de vel kun af    Sagnet. Paa Øer Disko vil man have paavist Ruinen af en saadan    Bygning, som besynderlig nok særlig sagdes at have været benyttet    til Festligheder af erotisk Natur.” Boas, “The Central Eskimo,”    passim; Lyon, Journal, p. 325 (Iglulik); Richardson, in Franklin’s    2d Exp., pp. 215-216 (Atkinson Island); Petitot, Monographie,    etc., xxx; “_Kêchim_, ou maison des assemblées;” Beechey, Voyage,    p. 268 (Point Hope); Dall, Alaska, p. 16 and elsewhere; Petroff,    Rep. p. 128 and elsewhere.]    [Footnote N152: Tents, etc., p. 136.]    [Footnote N153: See references to Dall and Petroff, above.]_Snow houses_ (_apúya_).--Houses of snow are used only temporarily, asfor instance at the hunting grounds on the rivers, and occasionally byvisitors at the village who prefer having their own quarters. Forexample, a man and his wife who had been living at Nuwŭk decided inthe winter of 1882-’83 to come down and settle at Utkiavwĭñ, where thewoman’s parents lived. Instead of going to one of the houses in thevillage, they built themselves a snow house in which they spent thewinter. The man said he intended to build a wooden house the nextseason. These houses are not built on the dome or beehive shape sooften described among the Eskimo of the middle region of Dr.Rink.[N154]    [Footnote N154: Parry, 2nd Voy., p. 160 and plate opposite;    Franklin, 1st Exped. vol. 2, pp. 43-47, ground plan, p. 46; Boas,    “Central Eskimo,” pp. 539-553; Kumlien, Contributions, etc.,    p. 31; Petitot, Monographie, etc., p. xvii (a full description    with a ground plan and section on p. xix), and all the popular    accounts of the Eskimo.]The idea naturally suggests itself that this form of building isreally a snow _tupek_ or tent, while the form used at Point Barrow issimply the iglu built of snow instead of wood. When built on levelground, as in the village, the snow house consists of an oblong roomabout 6 feet by 12, with walls made of blocks of snow, and high enoughfor a person to stand up inside. Beams or poles are laid across thetop, and over these is stretched a roof of canvas. At the south end isa low narrow covered passage of snow about 10 feet long leading to alow door not over 2½ feet high, above which is the window, made, asbefore described, of seal entrail. The opening at the outer end of thepassage is at the top, so that one climbs over a low wall of snow toenter the house.At the right side of the passage, close to the house, is a smallfireplace about 2½ feet square and built of slabs of snow, with asmoke hole in the top and a stick stuck across at the proper height tohang a pot on. When the first fire is built in such a fireplace thereis considerable melting of the surface of the snow, but as soon as thefire is allowed to go out this freezes to a hard glaze of ice, whichafterwards melts only to a trifling extent. Opposite to the door ofthe house, which is protected by a curtain of canvas, corresponding tothe Greenlandic ubkuaĸ, “a skin which is hung up before the entranceof the house,”[N155] the floor is raised into a banquette about 18inches high, on which are laid boards and skins. Cupboards areexcavated under the banquette, or in the walls, and pegs are driveninto the walls to hang things on. As such a house is only large enoughfor one family, there is only one lamp, which stands at the right-handside of the house[N156].    [Footnote N155: Grønlandsk Ordbog, p. 404; Kane’s 1st Grinnell    Exp., p. 40, calls it a “skin-covered door.” Compare, also, the    skin or matting hung over the entrance of the houses at Norton    Sound, Dall, Alaska, p. 13, and the bear-skin doors of the    Nunatañmiun and other Kotzebue Sound natives, mentioned by Dr.    Simpson, op. cit., p. 259.]    [Footnote N156: Compare Dr. Simpson’s description, op. cit.,    p. 259.]  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Ground plan of large snow house.]At the hunting grounds, or on the road thither in the winter, a placeis selected for the house where the snow is deeply drifted under theedge of some bank, so that most of the house can be made byexcavation. When necessary, the walls are built up and roofed overwith slabs of snow. Such a house is very speedily built. The firstparty that goes over the road to the hunting ground usually buildshouses at the end of each day’s march, and these serve for the partiescoming later, who have simply to clear out the drifted snow or perhapsmake some slight repairs. On arriving at the hunting ground theyestablish themselves in larger and more comfortable houses of the samesort; generally for two families. Lieut. Ray, who visited these camps,has drawn the plan represented in Fig. 14. There is a banquette, _a_,at each end of the room, which is much broader than long (compare theform of house common at Kotzebue Sound, mentioned above, p. 78), butonly one lamp, on a low shelf of snow, _b_, running across the back ofthe room and excavated below into a sort of cupboard. There are alsosimilar cupboards, _c_, at different places in the walls, and a longtunnel, _f_, with the usual storerooms, _i_, and kitchen, _h_, fromwhich a branch tunnel often leads to an adjoining house. The floor ismarked _d_, the entrance to the tunnel _g_, and the door _e_. Thehouse is lighted by the seal-gut windows of the iglu brought from thevillage.On going into camp the railed sled is stuck points down into the snowand net-poles, or ice-picks, thrust through the rails, making atemporary cache frame,[N157] on which are hung bulky articles--snowshoes and guns.[N158] Small storehouses of snow or iceare built to contain provisions. In the autumn, many such houses arebuilt in the village, of slabs of clear fresh-water ice about 4 inchesthick cemented together by freezing. These resemble the buildings offresh-water ice at Iglulik, described by Capt. Lyon.[N159]    [Footnote N157: Compare the woodcut on p. 406, vol. 1, of Kane’s    2d Exp., where two sleds are represented as stuck up on end with    their “upstanders” meeting to form a platform--Smith Sound.]    [Footnote N158: Firearms can not be carried into a warm room in    cold weather, as the moisture in the air immediately condenses on    the cold surface of the metal.]    [Footnote N159: Journal, p. 204; see also the plate opposite    p. 358 of Parry’s 2d Voyage.]Other temporary structures of snow, sometimes erected in the village,serve as workshops. One of these, which was built at the edge of thevillage in April, 1883, was an oblong building long enough to hold anumiak, giving sufficient room to get around it and work, and between 6and 7 feet high. The walls were of blocks of snow and the roof ofcanvas stretched over poles. One end was left open, but covered by acanvas curtain, and a banquette of snow ran along each side. It waslighted by oblong slabs of clear ice set into the walls, and warmed byseveral lamps. Several men in succession used this house for repairingand rigging up their umiaks, and others who had whittling to dobrought their work to the same place.Such boat shops are sometimes built by digging a broad trench in asnowbank and roofing it with canvas. Women dig small holes in thesnow, which they roof over with canvas and use for work-rooms in whichto dress seal skins. In such cases there is probably somesuperstitious reason, which we failed to learn, for not doing the workin the iglu. The tools used in building the snow houses are theuniversal wooden snow-shovel and the ivory snow-knife, for cutting andtrimming the blocks. At the present day saws are very much used forcutting the blocks, and also large iron knives (whalemen’s “boardingknives,” etc.) obtained from the ships._Tents_ (_tupĕk_).--During the summer all the natives live in tents,which are pitched on dry places upon the top of the cliffs or upon thegravel beach, usually in small camps of four or five tents each. A fewfamilies go no farther than the dry banks just southwest of thevillage, while the rest of the inhabitants who have not gone eastwardtrading or to the rivers hunting reindeer are strung along the coast.The first camp below Utkiavwĭñ is just beyond the double lagoon ofNunava, about 4 miles away, and the rest at intervals of 2 or 3 miles,usually at some little inlet or stream at places called Sê´kqluka,Nakĕ´drixo, Kuosu´gru, Nună´ktuau, Ĭpersua, Wă´lăkpa (Refuge Inlet,according to Capt. Maguire’s map, Parl. Rep. for 1854, opp. p. 186),Er´nĭvwĭñ, Sĭ´ñaru, and Sa´kămna. It is these summer camps seen frompassing ships which have given rise to the accounts of numerousvillages along this coast. There is usually a small camp on the beachat Sĭ´nnyû and one at Imê´kpûñ, while a few go to Pernyû even early inthe season.As the sea opens the people from the lower camps travel up the coastand concentrate at Pernyû, where they meet the Nuwuñmiun, theNunatañmiun traders, and the whalemen, and are joined later in theseason by the trading parties returning from the east, all of whomstop for a few days at Pernyû. On returning to the village also, inSeptember, the tents are pitched in dry places among the houses andoccupied till the latter are dry enough to live in. Tents are used inthe autumnal deer hunts, before snow enough falls to build snowhouses. In the spring of 1883, when the land floe was very heavy andrough off Utkiavwĭñ, all who were going whaling in the Utkiavwĭñ boatswent into camp with their families in tents pitched on the crown ofthe beach at Imêkpûñ, whence a path led off to the open water.The tents are nowadays always made of cloth, either sailcloth obtainedfrom wrecks or drilling, which is purchased from the ships. The latteris preferred as it makes a lighter tent and both dark blue and whiteare used. Reindeer or seal skins were used for tents as lately as1854. Elson saw tents of sealskin lined with reindeer skin at RefugeInlet,[N160] and Hooper mentions sealskin tents at Cape Smyth andPoint Barrow.[N161] Dr. Simpson gives a description of the skin tentsat Point Barrow.[N162] Indeed, it is probable that canvas tents werenot common until after the great “wreck seasons” of 1871 and 1876,when so many whaleships were lost. The Nunatañmiun at Pernyû had tentsof deerskin, and I remember also seeing one sealskin tent at the sameplace, which, it is my impression, belonged to a man from Utkiavwĭñ.Deerskin tents are used by the Anderson River natives,[N163] whilesealskins are still in use in Greenland and the east generally.[N164]The natives south of Kotzebue Sound do not use tents, but have summerhouses erected above ground and described as “generally log structuresroofed with skins and open in front.”[N165] That they have not alwaysbeen ignorant of tents is shown by the use of the word “topek” for adwelling at Norton Sound.[N166]    [Footnote N160: Beechey’s Voyage, p. 315.]    [Footnote N161: Tents, etc., pp. 216, 225.]    [Footnote N162: Op. cit., p. 260.]    [Footnote N163: MacFarlane MSS. and Petitot, Monographie, etc.,    p. xx, “des tentes coniques (_tuppeρk_) en peaux de renne.”]    [Footnote N164: See Rink, Tales, etc., p. 7 (“skins” in this    passage undoubtedly means sealskins, as they are more plentiful    than deerskins among the Greenlanders, and were used for this    purpose in Egede’a time--Greenland, p. 117; and Kumlien, op. cit.,    p. 33.). In east Greenland, according to Holm, “Om Sommeren bo    Angsmagsalikerne i Telte, der ere betrukne med dobbelte Skind og    have Tarmskinds Forhæng.” Geogr. Tids., vol. 8, p. 89. In    Frobisher’s description of Meta Incognita (in 1577), he says:    “Their houses are tents made of seale skins, pitched up with 4    Firre quarters, foure square, meeting at the toppe, and the    skinnes sewed together with sinewes, and layd thereupon.”    Hakluyt’s Voyages, etc. (1589), p. 628. See also Boas, “Central    Eskimo.”]    [Footnote N165: Petroff, op. cit., p. 128.]    [Footnote N166: Dall, Alaska, p. 13.]The tents at Point Barrow are still constructed in a manner verysimilar to that described by Dr. Simpson (see reference above). Fouror five poles about 12 feet long are fastened together at the top andspread out so as to form a cone, with a base about 12 feet indiameter. Inside of these about 6 feet from the ground is lashed alarge hoop, upon which are laid shorter poles (sometimes spears, umiakoars, etc.). The canvas cover, which is now made in one piece, iswrapped spirally round this frame, so that the edges do not meet infront except at the top, leaving a triangular space or doorway, filledin with a curtain of which part is a translucent membrane, which canbe covered at night with a piece of cloth. A string runs from theupper corner of the cloth round the apex of the tent and comesobliquely down the front to about the middle of the edge of the otherend of the cloth. The two edges are also held together by a stringacross the entrance. Heavy articles, stones, gravel, etc., are laid onthe flap of the tent to keep it down, and spears, paddles, etc., arelaid up against the outside. (See Fig. 15, from a photograph by Lieut.Ray.)  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Tent on the beach at Utkiavwĭñ.]Inside of the tent there is much less furniture than in the iglu, asthe lamp is not needed for heating and lighting, and the cooking isdone outdoors on tripods erected over fires. The sleeping place is atthe back of the tent, and is usually marked off by laying a log acrossthe floor, and spreading boards on the ground. Not more than onefamily usually occupy a tent. The tents at the whaling camp mentionedabove were, at first, fitted out with snow passages and fireplaceslike a snow hut, and many had a low wall of snow around them, butthese had all melted before the camp was abandoned.These tents differ considerably in model from those in use in theeast, though all are made by stretching a cover over radiating poles.For example, the tents in Greenland have the front nearlyvertical,[N167] while at Cumberland Gulf two sets of poles connectedby a ridgepole are used, those for the front being the shorter.[N168]The fashion at Iglulik is somewhat similar.[N169] Small rude tentsonly large enough to hold one or two people are used as habitationsfor women during confinement, and for sewing rooms when they areworking on deerskins in the autumn. Tents for the latter purpose arecalled “su´dliwĭñ,” the place for working.    [Footnote N167: Egede, Greenland, p. 117; Crantz, vol. 1, p. 141;    Rink, Tales, etc., p. 7.]    [Footnote N168: Kumlien, op. cit., p. 33.]    [Footnote N169: See Parry’s 2nd Voyage, p. 271 and plate opposite.    Compare also Chappell, “Hudson Bay,” pp. 75-77, figure on p. 75.]HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS.FOR HOLDING AND CARRYING FOOD, WATER, ETC._Canteens_ (_i´mutĭn_).--None of the canteens, the use of which hasbeen described above (under “Drinks”), were obtained for thecollection. They were seen only by Lieut. Ray and Capt. Herendeen, whomade winter journeys with the natives. They describe them as made ofsealskins and of small size. I find no published mention of the use ofsuch canteens among the Eskimo elsewhere, except in Baffin Land.[N170]    [Footnote N170: “When out traveling, they mostly carry their water    supply in a seal’s stomach, prepared for the purpose.” Kumlien,    op. cit., p. 41. Compare also Hall, Arctic Researches, p. 584.]_Wallets, etc._--Food and such things are carried in roughly made bagsof skin or cloth, or sometimes merely wrapped up in a piece of skin orentrail, or whatever is convenient. Special bags, however, are usedfor bringing in the small fish which are caught through the ice. Theseare flat, about 18 inches or 2 feet square, and made of an oblongpiece of sealskin, part of an old kaiak cover, doubled at the bottomand sewed up each side, with a thong to sling it over the shoulders._Buckets and tubs._--Buckets and tubs of various sizes are used forholding water and other fluids, blubber, flesh, entrails, etc., in thehouse, and are made by bending a thin plank of wood (spruce or fir)round a nearly circular bottom and sewing the ends together. These areprobably all obtained from the Nunatañmiun, as it would be almostimpossible to procure suitable wood at Point Barrow. The collectioncontains four specimens--two tubs and two buckets.  [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Wooden bucket. 1/5]No. 56764 [370] (Fig. 16) will serve as a type of the water bucket(kûtau´ɐ). A thin strip of spruce 8 inches wide is bent round acircular bottom of the same wood 10¼ inches in diameter. The edge ofthe latter is slightly rounded and fits into a shallow crozeone-fourth inch from the lower edge of the strip. The ends of thestrip overlap 3½ inches and are sewed together with narrow strips ofwhalebone in two vertical seams of short stitches, one seam close tothe outer end, which is steeply chamfered off and painted red, and theother 1.6 inches from this. Both seams are countersunk in shallowgrooves on the outer part. The bucket is ornamented with a shallowgroove running round the top, and a vertical groove between the seams.These grooves and the seam grooves are painted red. The bail is ofstout iron wire fastened on by two ears of white walrus ivory cut intoa rude outline of a whale, and secured by neat lashings of whalebonepassing through corresponding holes in the ear and the bucket. Thebucket has been some time in use.No. 56763 [369] is a bucket with a bail, and very nearly of the sameshape and dimensions. It has, however, a bail made of rope yarnsbraided together, and the ears are plain flat pieces of ivory. Bucketsof this size, with bails, are especially used for water, particularlyfor bringing it from the ponds and streams. The name “kûtauɐ”corresponds to the Greenlandic kátauaĸ, “a water-pail with which wateris brought to the house.”[N171]    [Footnote N171: Grønl. Ordbog., p. 135.]No. 89891 [1735] (Fig. 17), which is nearly new, is a very large tub(ilulĭ´kpûñ, which appears to mean “a capacious thing”) without abail, and is 11 inches high and 20 in diameter. The sides are made oftwo pieces of plank of equal length, whose ends overlap alternatelyand are sewed together as before. The bottom is in two pieces, onelarge and one small, neatly fastened together with two dowels, and isnot only held in by having its edge chamfered to fit the croze, but ispegged in with fourteen small treenails. The seams, edges, and twoornamental grooves around the top are painted red as before.  [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Large tub. 1/12]No. 89890 [1753] is smaller, 9.7 inches high and 14.5 in diameter. Ithas no bail, and is ornamented with two grooves, of which the lower ispainted with black lead. The bottom is in two equal pieces, fastenedtogether with three dowels. This is a new tub and has the knotholesneatly plugged with wood. There are a number of these tubs in everyhouse. They are known by the generic name of imusiáru (which isapplied also to a barrel, and which means literally “an unusual cup ordipper,” small cups of the same shape being called i´musyû), but havespecial names signifying their use. For instance, the little tub about6 inches in diameter, used by the males as a urinal, is called kúvwĭñ(“the place for urine.”) One of these large tubs always stands tocatch the drip from the lump of snow in the house, and those of thelargest size, like No. 89891 [1735], are the kind used as chamberpots.Vessels of this sort are in use throughout Alaska, and have beenobserved among the eastern Eskimo where they have wood enough to makethem. For instance, the Eskimo of the Coppermine River “form very neatdishes of fir, the sides being made of thin deal, bent into an ovalform, secured at the ends by sewing, and fitted so nicely to thebottom as to be perfectly water-tight.”[N172] There are specimens inthe Museum from the Mackenzie and Anderson Rivers, described in theMacFarlane MS. as “pots for drinking with, pails for carrying andkeeping water, and also as chamber pots. Oil is also sometimes carriedin them in winter.”    [Footnote N172: Franklin, 1st Exp., vol. 2, p. 181.]In some places where wood is scarce vessels of a similar pattern aremade of whalebone. Vessels “made of whalebone, in a circular form, onepiece being bent into the proper shape for the sides,” are mentionedby Capt. Parry on the west shore of Baffins Bay,[N173] and “circularand oval vessels of whalebone” were in use at Iglulik.[N174] This isthe same as the Greenlandic vessel called pertaĸ (a name which appearsto have been transferred in the form pĭ´túño to the wooden meat bowlat Point Barrow), “a dish made of a piece of whalebone bent into ahoop, which makes the sides, with a wooden bottom inserted.”[N175]Nordenskiöld speaks of vessels of whalebone at Pitlekaj, but does notspecify the pattern.[N176] Whalebone dishes were used at Point Barrow,but at the present day only small ones for drinking-cups are ingeneral service. One large dish was collected. (Fig. 18. No. 89850[1199]).  [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Whalebone dish. 1/4]A strip of whalebone 4¼ inches wide is bent round a nearly circularbottom of cottonwood so as to form a small tub. The edges of thebottom are chamfered to fit a shallow croze in the whalebone. Theoverlapping ends of the whalebone are sewed together with a strip ofwhalebone in long stitches. This dish is quite old and impregnatedwith grease. Vessels of this kind are uncommon, and it is probablethat none have been made since whalebone acquired its presentcommercial value. They were very likely in much more general useformerly, as when there was no such market for whalebone as at presentit would be cheaper to make tubs of this material than to buy woodenones. In corroboration of this view it may be noted that Dr. Simpsondoes not mention woodenware among the articles brought for sale by theNunatañmiun.[N177] The small whalebone vessels will be described underdrinking cups, which see.    [Footnote N173: First Voy., p. 286.]    [Footnote N174: Second Voy., p. 503.]    [Footnote N175: Grønl. Ordbog., p. 293.]    [Footnote N176: Vega, vol. 2, p. 124.]    [Footnote N177: Op. cit., p. 266.]_Meat bowls._--(Pĭ´tûño, see remarks on p. 88.) Large wooden bowls areused to hold meat, fat, etc., both raw and cooked, which are generallyserved on trays. These are of local manufacture and carved from blocksof soft driftwood. The four specimens collected are all made ofcottonwood, and, excepting No. 73570 [408], have been long in use andare thoroughly impregnated with grease and blood.No. 89864 [1322] (Fig. 19) will serve as the type. This is deep andnearly circular, with flat bottom and rounded sides. The brim isornamented with seven large sky-blue glass beads imbedded in it atequal intervals, except on one side, where there is a broken notch inthe place of a bead.  [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Meat bowl. 1/4]Another, No. 89863 [1320], is larger and not flattened on the bottom,and the brim is thinner. It is also provided with a bail of sealthong, very neatly made, as follows: One end of the thong is knottedwith a single knot into one of the holes so as to leave one long partand one short part (about 3 inches). The long part is then carriedacross and through the other hole from the outside, back again throughthe first hole and again across, so that there are three parts ofthong stretched across the bowl. The end is then tightly wrapped in aclose spiral round all the other parts, including the short end, andthe wrapping is finished off by tucking the end under the last turn.The specimen shows the method of mending wooden dishes, boxes, etc.,which have split. A hole is bored on each side of the crack, andthrough the two is worked a neat lashing of narrow strips ofwhalebone, which draws the parts together.In No. 89865 [1321], which has been split wholly across, there are sixsuch stitches, nearly equidistant, holding the two parts together.This bowl is strengthened by neatly riveting a thin flat “strap” ofwalrus ivory along the edge across the end of the crack. These threebowls are of nearly the same shape, which is the common one. The newbowl (No. 73570 [408]) is of a less common shape, being not so nearlyhemispherical as the others, but shaped more like a common milk pan.It is ornamented with straight lines drawn in black lead, dividing thesurface into quadrants. These were probably put on to catch the whiteman’s eye, as the bowl was made for the market. Dishes of thisdescription are common throughout Alaska (see the National Museumcollections) and have been noted at Plover Bay.[N178]    [Footnote N178: Hooper, Tents, etc., p. 147.]FOR PREPARING FOOD._Pots of stone and other materials (u´tkuzĭñ)._--In former times, potsof soapstone resembling those employed by the eastern Eskimo, andprobably obtained from the same region as the lamps, were used forcooking food at Point Barrow, but the natives have so long been ableto procure metal kettles directly or indirectly from the whites (Elsonfound copper kettles at Point Barrow in 1826)[N179] that the formerhave gone wholly out of use, and at the present day fragments only areto be found. There are four such fragments in the collection, of whichthree are of the same model and one quite different.  [Illustration: FIG. 20.--Stone pot. 1/4]No. 89885-6 [1559] (Fig. 20) is sufficiently whole to show the patternof the first type. It is of soft gray soapstone. A large angular gapis broken from the middle of one side, taking out about half of thisside, and a small angular piece from the bottom. From the corner ofthis gap the pot has been broken obliquely across the bottom, andmended in three places with stitches of whalebone made as describedunder No. 89865 [1321]. One end is cut down for about half its height,and the edge carried round in a straight line till it meets the gap inthe broken side. This end appears to have been pieced with a freshpiece of stone, as there are holes for stitches in the edge of thewhole side and in the upper edge of the broken side. There are alsotwo “stitch holes” at the other side of the gap, showing how it wasoriginally mended. A low transverse ridge across the middle of thewhole end was probably an ornament. Holes for strings by which the potwas hung up are bored one-fourth to one-half inch from the brim. Twoof these are bored obliquely through the corners, which are now brokenoff. The holes in the sides close to the corners were probably made totake the place of these. The pot is neatly and smoothly made, and thebrim is slightly rounded. It shows signs of great age, and isblackened with soot and crusted with oil and dirt.[N180]    [Footnote N179: Beechey’s Voyage, p. 572.]    [Footnote N180: This specimen was broken in transportation, and    the pieces received different Museum numbers. It is now mended    with glue.]Nos. 89886 [680] and 89868 [1096] are much less complete. They are thebroken ends of pots slightly smaller than the above, but of preciselythe same pattern, even to the ornamental transverse ridge across theend.[N181] The string holes are bored through the corners as before,and in both pots are holes showing where they have been mended bywhalebone stitches, fragments of which are still sticking in one pot.This method of mending soapstone vessels by sewing is mentioned byCapt. Parry as practiced at Iglulik.[N182]    [Footnote N181: Compare these pots with the two figured in Parry’s    2d Voyage (plate opposite p. 160). The smaller of these has a    ridge only on the end, but on the larger the ridge runs all the    way round. The plate also shows how the pots were hung up. See    also Fig. 1, plate opposite p. 548.]    [Footnote N182: 2d Voyage, p. 502.]  [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Small stone pot. 1/4]No. 89883 [1097] (Fig. 21) is a small pot of a quite different shape,best understood from the figure. Round the edge are eight holes forstrings nearly equidistant. The outside is rough, especially on thebottom. One of the sides is much gapped, and the acute tip has beenbroken off obliquely and mended with a stitch of whalebone. The careused in mending these vessels shows that they were valuable and noteasily replaced. I can find no previous mention of the use of stonevessels for cooking on the western coast, and there are no specimensin the National Museum collections. The only Eskimo stone vessels area couple of small stone bowls from Bristol Bay. These are very muchthe shape of the wooden bowls above described, and appear to have beenused as oil dishes and not for cooking, as the inside is crusted withgrease, while the outside is not blackened. On the other hand, stonecooking pots are very generally employed even now by the easternEskimos, and have been frequently described.[N183] The closeresemblance of the pots from Point Barrow to those described by Capt.Parry, taken in connection with Dr. Simpson’s statement[N184] that thestone lamps were brought from the east, renders it very probable thatthe kettles were obtained in the same way. The absence of this utensilamong the southern Eskimo of Alaska is probably due to the fact thatbeing inhabitants of a well wooded district they would have no need ofcontrivances for cooking over a lamp.    [Footnote N183: I need only refer to Crantz, who describes the    “bastard-marble kettle,” hanging “by four strings fastened to the    roof, which kettle is a foot long and half a foot broad, and    shaped like a longish box” (vol. 1, p. 140); the passage from    Parry’s 2d Voyage, referred to above; Kumlien, op. cit., p. 20    (Cumberland Gulf); Boas, “Central Eskimo,” p. 545; and Gilder,    Schwatka’s Search, p. 260 (West Shore of Hudson Bay).]    [Footnote N184: Op. cit., pp. 267-269.]I obtained three fragments of pottery, which had every appearance ofgreat age and were said to be pieces of a kind of cooking-pot whichthey used to make “long ago, when there were no iron kettles.” Thematerial was said to be earth (nu´na), bear’s blood, andfeathers,[N185] and appears to have been baked. They are irregularfragments (No. 89697 [1589], Fig. 22) of perhaps more than one vessel,which appears to have been tall and cylindrical, perhaps shaped like abean-pot, pretty smooth inside, and coated with dried oil or blood,black from age. The outside is rather rough, and marked with faintrounded transverse ridges, as if a large cord had been wound round thevessel while still soft. The largest shard has been broken obliquelyacross and mended with two stitches of sinew, and all are very old andblack.    [Footnote N185: Compare the cement for joining pieces of soapstone    vessels mentioned by Boas (“Central Eskimo,” p. 526) consisting of    “seal’s blood, a kind of clay, and dog’s hair.”]  [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Fragments of pottery.]Beechey (Voyage, p. 295) speaks of “earthen jars for cooking” atHotham Inlet in 1826 and 1827, and Mr. E. W. Nelson has collected afew jars from the Norton Sound region, very like what those used atPoint Barrow must have been. Choris figures a similar vessel in hisVoyage Pittoresque, Pl. III (2d), Fig. 2, from Kotzebue Sound. Metalkettles of various sorts are now exclusively used for cooking, and arecalled by the same name as the old soapstone vessels, which it will beobserved corresponds to the name used by the eastern Eskimo. Lightsheet-iron camp-kettles are eagerly purchased and they are very gladto get any kind of small tin cans, such as preserved meat tins, whichthey use for holding water, etc., and sometimes fit with bails ofstring or wire, so as to use them for cooking porridge, etc., over thelamp. They had learned the value of these as early as Maguire’stime,[N186] as had the people of Plover Bay in 1849.[N187]    [Footnote N186: See Further Papers, etc., p. 909.]    [Footnote N187: Hooper, Tents, etc., p. 57.]_Bone crushers._--In preparing food it is often desirable to break thelarge bones of the meat, both to obtain the marrow and to facilitatethe trying out of the fat for making the pemmican already described.Deer bones are crushed into a sort of coarse bone-meal for feeding thedogs when traveling. For this purpose heavy short-handled stone maulsare used. These tools may have been formerly serviceable as hammersfor driving treenails, etc., as the first specimen obtained wasdescribed as “savik-pidjûk-nunamisinĭ´ktuɐ-kau´teɐ” (literally“iron-not-dead-hammer”), or the hammer used by those now dead, who hadno iron. For this purpose, however, they are wholly superseded by ironhammers, and are now only used for bone crushers. The collectioncontains a large series of these implements, namely, 13 complete maulsand 13 unhafted heads. All are constructed on the same general plan,consisting of an oblong roughly cylindrical mass of stone, with flatends, mounted on the expanded end of a short haft, which is applied tothe middle of one side of the cylinder and is slightly curved, likethe handle of an adz. Such a haft is frequently made of the “branch”of a reindeer antler, and the expanded end is made by cutting off aportion of the “beam” where the branch joins it. A haft so made isnaturally elliptical and slightly curved at right angles to the longerdiameter of the ellipse, and is applied to the head so that thegreatest thickness and therefore the greatest strength comes in theline of the blow, as in a civilized ax or hammer. The head and haftare held together by a lashing of thong or three-ply braid of sinew,passing through a large hole in the large end of the haft and roundthe head. This lashing is put on wet and dries hard and tight.[N188]It follows the same general plan in all the specimens, though no twoare exactly alike. The material of the heads, with three exceptions(No. 56631 [222], gray porphyry; No. 89654 [906], black quartzite, andNo. 89655 [1241], coarse-grained gray syenite), is massive pectolite(see above, p. 60), generally of a pale greenish or bluish gray colorand slightly translucent, sometimes dark and opaque. No. 56635 [243]will serve as the type of these implements.[N189]    [Footnote N188: We saw this done on No. 56634 [83], the head and    haft of which were brought in separate and put together by an    Eskimo at the station.]    [Footnote N189: Figured in Ray’s Point Barrow Report, Ethnology,    Pl. II, Fig. 6.]The head is of light bluish gray pectolite, and is lashed with athree-ply braid of reindeer sinew to a haft of some soft coniferouswood, probably spruce, rather smoothly whittled out and soiled byhandling. The transverse ridge on the under side of the butt is tokeep the hand from slipping off the grip. The whole is dirty and showssigns of considerable age.These mauls vary considerable in size. The largest is 7.1 inches longand 2.5 in diameter, and the smallest 2.1 inches long by 2.4. This isa very small hammer, No. 56634 [83] having a haft only 4.7 incheslong. The haft is usually about 5 inches long. The longest (belongingto one of the smaller heads, 4 inches by 2) is 7.2 inches long, andthe shortest (belonging to a slightly larger head, 4.7 by 3.1 inches)is 4.5 inches. The largest two heads, each 7.1 by 2.5 inches, havehafts 5 inches long.  [Illustration: FIG. 23.--Stone maul. 3/8]The lashing of all is put on in the same general way, namely, bysecuring one end round the head and through the eye, then taking avariable number of turns round the head and through the hole, andtightening these up by wrapping the end spirally round all the parts,where they stretch from head to haft on each side. Seal thong, narrowor broad, is more generally used than sinew braid (only threespecimens out of the thirteen have lashings of sinew). When broadthong is used the loop is made by splicing, as follows: A slit is cutabout 1½ inches from the end of the thong, and the end is doubled in abight and passed through this slit. The end is then slit and the otherend of the thong passed through it and drawn taut, making a splicewhich holds all the tighter for drawing on it. A simple loop is tiedin sinew braid.  [Illustration: FIG. 24.--Stone maul. 3/8]The following figures will illustrate the most important variations inthe form of this implement. Fig. 23, No. 56634 [83] from Utkiavwĭñ,has a head of light gray pectolite, slightly translucent, andevidently ground flat on the faces, and the haft is of reindeerantler, with a slight knob at the butt. A square piece of buckskin isdoubled and inserted between the head and haft. The lashing is of finesealskin twine, and the spiral wrapping is carried wholly round thehead. This was the first stone maul collected, and was put together atthe station, as mentioned above. It is rather smaller than usual. Fig.24, No. 56637 [196], from Utkiavwĭñ, has the head of grayishpectolite, rough and unusually large. The haft is of some softconiferous wood soaked with grease. It is nearly round, instead ofelliptical, with an irregular knob at the butt, and not curved, butfastened obliquely to the head. The loop of double thong attached tothe haft is probably to go round the wrist.  [Illustration: FIG. 25.--Stone maul. 3/8]Fig. 25, No. 56639 [161], from Utkiavwĭñ, is of pectolite, the upperand lower faces almost black and the sides light gray. The haft is ofhard wood and unusually long (7.2 inches). It is noticeable for beingattached at right angles to the head, by a very stout lashing of thongof the usual kind, and further tightened by a short flat stick wedgedin below the head on one side. There appears to have been a similar“key” on the other side. This is an unusual form.  [Illustration: FIG. 26.--Stone maul. 3/8]Fig. 26, No. 89654 [906], is from Nuwŭk. The head is an oblong, nearlycylindrical, water-worn pebble of black quartzite, 7.1 inches long;the haft is of reindeer antler, and the lashing of seal thong.Fig. 27, No. 89655 [1241], from Utkiavwĭñ. The head of this maul is along pebble of rather coarse-grained gray syenite, and is peculiar inhaving a shallow groove roughly worked out round the middle to keepthe lashing from slipping. It is 4.7 inches long and 3.1 in diameter.The haft is of reindeer antler 4.5 inches long, and the lashing ofseal thong peculiar only in the large number of turns in the spiralwrappings.  [Illustration: FIG. 27.--Stone maul. 3/8]  [Illustration: FIG. 28.--Stone maul. 3/8]Fig. 28, No. 89657 [877], from Nuwŭk. This is peculiar in having thehaft fitted into a deep angular groove on one side of the head, whichis of pectolite and otherwise of the common pattern. The haft ofreindeer antler and the lashing of broad thong are evidently newerthan the head and are clumsily made and put on, the latter makingseveral turns about one side of the haft as well as through it andround the head.None of the unmounted heads, which are all of pectolite, are groovedin this way to receive the haft, but No. 56658 [205] has two shallow,incomplete grooves round the middle for lashings, and No. 56655 [218],which is nearly square in section, has shallow notches on the edgesfor the same purpose. One specimen of the series comes from Sidaru,but differs in no way from specimens from the northern villages.Stone mauls of this type have previously been seldom found among theAmerican Eskimo. The only specimens in the Museum from America are twosmall unhafted maul heads of pectolite, one from Hotham Inlet and theother from Cape Nome, and a roughly made maul from Norton Sound, allcollected by Mr. Nelson. The last is an oblong piece of dark-coloredjade rudely lashed to the end of a short thick stick, which has alateral projection round which the lashing passes instead of through ahole in the haft. Among the “Chukches” at Pithkaj, however,Nordenskiöld found stone mauls of precisely the same model as ours andalso used as bone crushers. He observed that the natives themselvesate the crushed bone after boiling it with blood and water.[N190]Lieut. Ray saw only dogs fed with it in the interior. Nordenskiölddoes not mention the kind of stone used for these tools, but the twoin the National Museum, collected by Mr. Nelson at Cape Wankarem, areboth of granite or syenite and have a groove for the lashing. (CompareNo. 89655 [1241], fig. 27.)    [Footnote N190: Vega, vol. 2, p. 113; figures on p. 112.]  [Illustration: FIG. 29.--Bone maul. 3/8]In addition to the above-described stone mauls, there are in thecollection five nearly similar mauls of heavy bone, which haveevidently served the same purpose. They were all brought over for salefrom Utkiavwĭñ at about the same time, and from their exceedingly oilycondition were evidently brought to light in rummaging round in theold “blubber-rooms,” where they have long lain forgotten. Four ofthese differ in no respect from the stone mauls except in having theheads made of whale’s rib; the fifth is all in one piece.  [Illustration: FIG. 30.--Bone maul. 3/8]The following figures will illustrate the general form of theseimplements: Fig. 29, No. 89847 [1046]: The head is a section of asmall rib, 4.8 inches long, and has a deep notch on each side toreceive the lashing. The haft is probably of spruce (it is soimpregnated with grease that it is impossible to be sure about it),and is rough and somewhat knobby, with a rounded knob on the butt andtwo shallow finger notches on the under side of the grip. It isattached by a lashing of stout thong of the ordinary pattern. Fig. 30,No. 89849 [1047]: The head is a straight four-sided block of whale’srib, 6 inches long. The deep notches for the lashing, one on eachside, are 1 inch behind the middle. The haft is a roughly whittledknotty piece of spruce, and instead of a knob has a thick flange onthe lower side of the butt. The lashing is of fourteen or fifteenturns of seal twine, and keyed upon each side by a roughly split stickthrust in under the head. Fig. 31, No. 89846 [1048]: This is peculiarin having the haft not attached at or near the middle of the head, butat one end, which is shouldered to receive it. The haft is of thecommon pattern and attached as usual, the lashing being made of verystout sinew braid. The head is a section of a small rib 6 inches long.Fig. 32, No. 89845 [1049]: This is made in one piece, and roughlycarved with broad cuts from a piece of whale’s jaw. The grooves andholes in the bone are the natural canals of blood vessels. All thesemauls are battered on the striking face, showing that they have beenused.  [Illustration: FIG. 31.--Bone maul. 3/8]  [Illustration: FIG. 32.--Bone maul. 3/8]At the first glance it seems as if we had here a series illustratingthe development of the stone hammer. Fig. 32 would be the first form,while the next step would be to increase the weight of the head bylashing a large piece of bone to the end of the haft, instead ofcarving the whole laboriously out of a larger piece of bone. Thesubstitution of the still heavier stone for the bone would obviouslysuggest itself next. The weak point in this argument, however, is thatthe advantage of the transition from the first to the next form is notsufficiently obvious. It seems to me more natural to suppose that thehafted stone hammer has been developed here, as is believed to havebeen the case elsewhere, by simply adding a handle to the pebble whichhad already been used as a hammer without one. These bone implementsare then to be considered as makeshifts or substitutes for the stonehammer, when stones suitable for making the latter could not beprocured. Now, such stones are rare at Point Barrow, and must bebrought from a distance or purchased from other natives; hence theoccasional use of such makeshifts as these. This view will account forthe rarity of these bone hammers, as well as the rudeness of theirconstruction. No. 89845 [1049] would thus be merely the result ofindividual fancy and not a link in the chain of development.FOR SERVING AND EATING FOOD.TRAYS.Cooked food is generally served in large shallow trays more or lessneatly carved from driftwood and nearly circular or oblong in shape.The collection contains two specimens of the circular form and threeoblong ones. All but one of these have been long in use and are verygreasy. No. 73576 [392] (Fig. 33) has been selected as the type of thecircular dishes (i´libiɐ). This is very smoothly carved from a singlepiece of pine wood. The brim is rounded, with a large rounded gap inone side, where a piece has probably been broken out. The brim isslightly cracked and chipped. The vessel is very greasy and showsmarks inside where meat has been cut up in it. No. 89867 [1323] is avery similar dish, and made of the same material, but ellipticalinstead of circular, and larger, being 22.5 inches long, 15.5 broad,and 2.1 deep. It has been split in two, and mended with whalebonestitches in the manner previously described.  [Illustration: FIG. 33.--Meat dish. 1/7]No. 73575 [223] (Fig. 34) is a typical oblong dish. It is neatlyhollowed out, having a broad margin painted with red ocher. Itmeasures 24 inches in length, is made of pine, rather roughly carvedon the outside, and is new and clean. This is a common form of dish.Fig. 35, No. 89868 [1377], is an old tray of an unusual form. It isrudely hewn out of a straight piece of plank, 34.8 inches long,showing inside and out the marks of a dull adz, called by the seller“kau´dlo tu´mai,” “the footprints of the stone (scil. adz).” Theexcavation is shallow and leaves a margin of 2 inches at one end, andthe outside is roughly beveled off at the sides and ends. The holesnear the ends were evidently for handles of thong. The material isspruce, discolored and somewhat greasy. Fig. 36, No. 89866 [1376], wassaid by the native who brought it over for sale to be especiallyintended for fish. It is much the shape of No. 73575 [223], butbroader, slightly deeper, and more curved. The brim is narrow androunded and the bottom smoothly rounded off. It measures 23.3 inchesin length, and is made of pine. It has been deeply split in two placesand stitched together with whalebone in the usual way. Trays anddishes of this sort are in general use among all Eskimo,[N191] and aresometimes made of tanned sealskins.[N192]    [Footnote N191: See for example, Crantz, vol. 1, p. 144,    Greenland; Parry, 2d. Voy., p. 503, Iglulik; and Hooper, Tents,    etc., p. 170, Plover Bay.]    [Footnote N192: Bessels, Naturalist, Sept. 1884, p. 867.]  [Illustration: FIG. 34.--Oblong meat dish. 1/8]  [Illustration: FIG. 35.--Oblong meat dish; very old. 1/8]  [Illustration: FIG. 36.--Fish dish. 1/10]DRINKING VESSELS._Whalebone Cup_ (_I´musyû_).--One of the commonest forms of drinkingvessels is a little tub of whalebone of precisely the same shape asthe large whalebone dish described above (p. 88). Of these there arefive specimens in the collection, all from Utkiavwĭñ. No. 89853 [1302](Fig. 37) will serve as the type. It is 4.6 inches long and made bybinding a strip of black whalebone round a spruce bottom, and sewingtogether the ends, which overlap each other about 1½ inches, withcoarse strips of whalebone.  [Illustration: FIG. 37.--Whalebone cup. 1/2]There are two vertical seams three-fourths inch apart. The bottom isheld in by fitting its slightly chamfered edge into a shallow crozecut in the whalebone. All these cups are made almost exactly alike,and nearly of the same size, varying only a fraction of an inch inheight, and from 4.2 to 5.5 inches in length. The only variation is inthe distance the ends overlap and the number of stitches in the seams.Such cups are to be found in nearly every house, and one is generallykept conveniently near the water bucket. Though the pattern is anancient one, they are still manufactured. No. 56560 [654] was foundamong the débris of one of the ruined houses at Utkiavwĭñ, and differsfrom the modern cups only in having the ends sewed together with oneseam instead of two, while No. 89851 [1300], though it has been inactual use, was made after our arrival, as the bottom is made of apiece of one of our cigar boxes.  [Illustration: FIG. 38.--Horn dipper. 1/4]Dippers of horn are in very general use for drinking water. These areall of essentially the same shape, and are made of the light yellowtranslucent horn of the mountain sheep. There are three specimens inour collection, of which No. 56534 [28] (Fig. 38) has been selected asthe type. This is made of a single piece of pale yellow translucenthorn, apparently softened and molded into shape, cut only on the edgesand the handle. A stout peg of antler is driven through the handle,1 inch from the tip, and projects behind, serving as a hook by whichto hang the dipper on the edge of a bucket. The other two are similarin shape and size, but No. 89831 [1293] has no peg, and has one sideof the handle cut into a series of slight notches to keep the handfrom slipping, while No. 89832 [1577] is rather straighter and has asmaller, shallower bowl, and the grip of the handle roughened withtransverse grooves. Fig. 39, No. 89739 [774|, is a horn dipper, butone that is very old and of a pattern no longer in use. The bowl,which is much broken and gapped, is oval and deep, with a thick handleat one end, running out in the line of the axis of the bowl. Thishandle, which is the thick part of the horn, near the tip, is flatabove, rounded below, and has its tip slightly rounded, apparently bya stone tool. Just where the bowl and handle meet there is a deeptransverse saw-cut, made to facilitate bending the handle into itsplace. The material is horn, apparently of the mountain sheep, turnedbrown by age and exposure. The specimen had been long lying neglectedround the village of Utkiavwĭñ.  [Illustration: FIG. 39.--Horn dipper. 1/4]Horn dippers of the same general pattern as these are commonthroughout Alaska. The Museum collection contains a large series ofsuch utensils, collected by Mr. Nelson and others. The cups anddippers of musk-ox horn found by Parry at Iglulik are somewhatdifferent in shape.[N193] Those made of the enlarged base ofhorn[N194] have a short handle and a nearly square bowl, while thehollow top of the horn is used for a cup without alteration beyondsometimes bending up the end, which serves as a handle.[N195]Curiously enough, cups of this last pattern appear not to be foundanywhere else except at Plover Bay, eastern Siberia, where verysimilar vessels (as shown by the Museum collections) are made from thehorn of the Siberian mountain sheep. An unusual form of dipper isbeautifully made of fossil ivory. Such cups are rare and highlyprized. We saw only three, one from each village, Nuwŭk, Utkiavwĭñ,and Sidaru, and all were obtained for the collection. They show signsof age and long use. They differ somewhat in shape and size, but eachis carved from a single piece of ivory and has a large bowl and astraight handle. No. 56535 [371] (Fig. 40), which will serve as thetype of the ivory dipper (i´musyû, kĭlĭgwû´garo), is neatly carvedfrom a single piece of fine-grained fossil ivory, yellowed by age. Thehandle, polished by long use, terminates in a blunt, recurved,tapering hook, which serves the purpose of the peg in the horn dipper.The rounded gap in the brim opposite the handle is an accidentalbreak. Another, No. 89830 [1259], from Sidaru, is a long trough-likecup, with rounded ends and a short flat handle at one end, made of ashort transverse section of a rather small tusk, keeping the naturalroundness of the tusk, but cut off flat on top and excavated. A woodenpeg, like those in the horn dippers, is inserted in the end of thehandle. This cup is especially interesting from its resemblance to theone obtained by Beechey (Voyage, Pl. I, Fig. 4) at Eschscholtz Bay,from which it differs only in being about 2 inches shorter and deeperin proportion. Thomas Simpson speaks of obtaining an ivory cup fromsome Point Barrow natives at Dease Inlet exactly like the one figuredby Beechey, but with the handle broken off.[N196] Fig. 41, No. 89833[933], from Nuwŭk, has a large bowl, nearly circular, with a broad,straight handle and a broad hook. The part of the bowl to which thehandle is attached, a semicircular piece 3 inches long and 1¾ wide,has been split out with the grain of the tusk, and mended with threestitches, in this case of sinew, in the usual manner. There was an oldgap in the brim opposite to the handle, and the edges of it have beenfreshly and roughly whittled down. The ornamentation of the outsideand handle, consisting of narrow incised lines and small circles, eachwith a dot in the center, is well shown in the figure. Theseengravings were originally colored with red ocher, but are now filledwith dirt and are nearly effaced by wear on the handle. This dipper isnot of such fine quality of ivory as the other two. It is not unlikelythat all these vessels were made by the natives around Kotzebue Sound,where ivory is plenty, and where Beechey, as quoted above, found oneso like one of ours. We were informed by the owner that No. 56535[371] was obtained from the Nunatañmiun.    [Footnote N193: Second Voyage, p. 503.]    [Footnote N194: See Fig. 26, plate opposite p. 550.]    [Footnote N195: See Figs. 8 and 9, opposite p. 548.]  [Illustration: FIG. 40.--Dipper of fossil ivory. 3/10]  [Illustration: FIG. 41.--Dipper of fossil ivory. 1/3]    [Footnote N196: Narrative, p. 148.]_Spoons and ladles._--Each family has several spoons of various sizes,and narrow shallow ladles of horn, bone, etc. The large spoon is forstirring and ladling soup, etc. There is only one specimen in thecollection, No. 89739 [1352] (Fig. 42). This is a new one, made by anative of Utkiavwĭñ, whom I asked to make himself a new spoon andbring me his old one. He, however, misunderstood me and brought overthe new one, which Lieut. Ray purchased, not knowing that I hadespecially asked for the old one. These spoons seem to be in suchconstant use that the natives did not offer them for sale. Thisspecimen is smoothly carved from a single piece of pine, and paintedall over, except the inside of the bowl, with red ocher. A cross ofred ocher is marked in the middle of the bowl, and there is a shallowgroove, colored with blacklead, along the middle of the handle on top.The length is 13.2 inches. A small spoon of light-colored horn, No.89416 [1379], has a bowl of the common spoon shape with a short, flathandle. Spoons of this sort were not seen in use, and as this is newand evidently made for sale it may be meant for a copy of one of ourspoons. The narrow ladles of horn or bone may formerly have been usedfor eating before it was so easy to get tin pots, but at present arechiefly used for dipping oil, especially for filling the lamp. Thecollection contains one of horn and four of bone.  [Illustration: FIG. 42.--Wooden spoon. 1/4]  [Illustration: FIG. 43.--Horn ladle. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 44.--Bone ladle. 1/2]No. 89415 [1070], Fig. 43, is made of a single piece of mountain-sheephorn, dark brown from age and use, softened and molded into shape. Itis impregnated with oil, showing that it has been long in use. Thisutensil closely resembles a great number of specimens in the Museumfrom the more southern parts of Alaska. No. 89411 [1294] (Fig. 44) isa typical bone ladle. The material is rather coarse-grained, compactbone from a whale’s rib or jawbone. No. 89414 [1013] closely resemblesthis but is a trifle larger. The other two specimens are interestingas showing an attempt at ornamentation. No. 89412 [1102] (Fig. 45,from Nuwŭk) is carved smoothly into a rude, flattened figure of awhale (Balaena mysticetus). The flukes form the handle and the bellyis hollowed out into the bowl of the ladle. No. 89413 [934] (Fig. 46,from Utkiavwĭñ) has the handle carved into a rude bear’s head, whichhas the eyes, nostrils, and outline of the mouth incised and filled inwith dark oil dregs. All these ladles have the curved side of the bowlon the left, showing that they were meant to be used with the righthand. The name, kĭliu´tɐ, obtained for these ladles is given in thevocabulary collected by Dr. Oldmixon as “scraper,” which seems to bethe etymological meaning of the word. These implements may be used forscraping blubber from skins, or the name may correspond in meaning tothe cognate Greenlandic kiliortût, “a scraper; especially a musselshell (a natural scraper).” The resemblance of these ladles to amussel shell is sufficiently apparent for the name to be applied tothem. Indeed, they may have been made in imitation of mussel shells,which the Eskimo, in all probability, like so many other savages, usedfor ladles as well as scrapers.  [Illustration: FIG. 45.--Bone ladle in the form of a whale. 1/4]  [Illustration: FIG. 46.--Bone ladle. 3/8]MISCELLANEOUS HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS._Lamps (kódlö)._--Mention has already been made of the stone lamps oroil-burners used for lighting and warming the houses, which, in Dr.Simpson’s time, were obtained by trading from the “Kûñmû´dlĭñ,” who inturn procured them from other Eskimo far to the east. These are flat,shallow dishes, usually like a gibbous moon in outline, and are of twosizes: the larger house lamp, 18 inches to 3 feet in length, and thesmall traveling lamp, 6 or 8 inches long. The latter is used in thetemporary snow huts when a halt is made at night. In each house areusually two lamps, one standing at each side, with the curved sideagainst the wall, and raised by blocks a few inches from the floor. Inone large house, that of old Yûksĭ´ña, the so-called “chief,” atNuwŭk, there were three lamps, the third standing in the right-handfront corner of the house. The dish is filled with oil, which isburned by means of a wick of moss fibers arranged along the outeredge. Large lamps are usually divided into three compartments, ofwhich the middle is the largest, by wooden partitions called sä´potĭn(corresponding to the Greenlandic saputit, “(1) a dam across a streamfor catching fish, (2) a dam or dike in general”), along which wickscan also be arranged. The women tend the lamps with great care,trimming and arranging the wick with little sticks. The lamp burnswith scarcely any smoke and a bright flame, the size of which isregulated by kindling more or less of the wick, and is usually keptfilled by the drip from a lump of blubber stuck on a sharp stick(ajû´ksûxbwĭñ) projecting from the wall about a foot above the middleof the lamp.[N197]    [Footnote N197: Compare the custom noticed by Parry, at Iglulik,    of hanging a long thin strip of blubber near the flame of the lamp    to feed it (2d Voyage, p. 502). According to Petitot (Monographie,    etc., p. xviii), the lamps in the Mackenzie district are fed by a    lump of blubber stuck on a stick, as at Point Barrow.]  [Illustration: FIG. 47.--Stone house lamp. 1/4]In most houses there is a long slender stick (kukun, “a lighter”),which the man of the house uses to light his pipe with when sitting onthe banquette, without the trouble of getting down, by dipping the endin the oil of the lamp and lighting this at the flame. The sticks usedfor trimming the wick also serve as pipe-lighters and for carryingfire across the room in the same way.[N198] No food, except anoccasional luncheon of porridge or something of the sort, is nowcooked over these lamps. Two such lamps burning at the ordinary rategive light enough to enable one to read and write with ease whensitting on the banquette, and easily keep the temperature between 50°and 60° F. in the coldest weather. In the collection are three houselamps, two complete and one merely a fragment, and three travelinglamps.    [Footnote N198: Compare Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2, p. 119: “The    wooden pins she uses to trim the wick . . . are used when required    as a light or torch . . . to light pipes, etc. In the same way    other pins dipped in train-oil are used” (Pitlekaj), and foot-note    on same page: “I have seen such pins, also oblong stones, sooty at    one end, which, after having been dipped in train-oil, have been    used as torches . . . in old Eskimo graves in northwestern    Greenland.”]  [Illustration: FIG. 48.--Sandstone lamp. 3/8]Fig. 47 (No. 89879) [872] is a typical house lamp, though rather asmall specimen. It is carved out of soft gray soapstone and is 17inches long. The back is nearly vertical, while the front flaresstrongly outward. The back wall is cut down vertically inside with anarrow rounded brim and the front curves gradually in from the veryedge to the bottom of the cavity, which is 1½ inches deep in themiddle. The posterior third of the cavity is occupied by a flat,straight shelf with a sloping edge about 0.7 inch high. About a thirdof one end of the lamp has been broken off obliquely and mended, asusual, with stitches. There are two of these neatly countersunk inchannels. The specimen has been long in use and is thoroughlyincrusted with oil and soot. No. 89880 [1731] (Fig. 48) is peculiar,from the material of which it is made. This is a coarse, gritty stone,rather soft, but much more difficult to work than the soapstone. It isrudely worked into something the same shape as the type, but has thecavity but slightly hollowed out, without a shelf, and only a littlesteeper behind than in front. The idea at once suggests itself thatthis lamp, which is very old and sooty, was made at Point Barrow andwas an attempt to imitate the imported lamps with stone obtained fromthe beds reported by Lieut. Ray in Kulugrua. There is, of course, nomeans of proving this supposition. There is no mention of any materialexcept soapstone being made into lamps by the Greenlanders or othereastern Eskimo, but the lamps from Kadiak and Bristol Bay in theNational Museum are made of some hard gray stone.  [Illustration: FIG. 49.--Traveling lamp. 3/8]Fig. 49, No. 56673 [133], is a traveling lamp, and is a miniature ofthe large lamp, No. 89879 [872], 8.7 inches long, 4.2 wide, and 1 inchhigh, also of soapstone and without a shelf. The front also isstraighter, and the whole more roughly made. No. 89882 [1298] isanother traveling lamp, also of soapstone, and made of about half of alarge lamp. It has been used little if at all since it was made over,as the inside is almost new while the outside is coated with soot andgrease. It is 6.3 inches long. No. 89881 [1209] is a miniature of No.89880, 8.1 inches long, and is made of the same gritty stone.  [Illustration: FIG. 50.--Socket for blubber holder. 3/8]Suitable material is not at hand for the proper comparison of thelamps used by the different branches of the Eskimo race. All travelerswho have written about the Eskimo speak of the use of such lamps,which agree in being shallow, oblong dishes of stone. Dr.Bessels[N199] figures a lamp of soapstone from Ita, Smith Sound,closely resembling No. 89880, and a little lamp in the Museum fromGreenland is of essentially the same shape, but deeper. The same formappears at Hudson Strait in the lamps collected by Mr. L. M. Turner,while those used at Iglulik are nearly semicircular.[N200] South ofKotzebue Sound lamps of the shape so common in the east are used, butthese, Mr. Turner informs me, are never made of soapstone, but alwaysof sandstone, shale, etc. The people of Kadiak and the Aleutsanciently used lamps of hard stone, generally oval in shape, andsometimes made by slightly hollowing out one side of a large roundpebble.[N201] Such a rough lamp was brought by Lieut. Stoney,U.S. Navy, from Kotzebue Sound. No such highly finished and elaboratelamps as the large house lamps at Point Barrow are mentioned except byNordenskiöld, who figures one from Siberia.[N202] This lamp isinteresting as the only one described with a ledge comparable to theshelf of No. 89879. Lamps from the region between Point Barrow andBoothia Felix are especially needed to elucidate the distribution anddevelopment of this utensil. The rudely hollowed pebble of the ancientAleut and the elaborate lamp of the Point Barrow Eskimo are evidentlythe two extremes of the series of forms, but the intermediate patternsare still to be described.    [Footnote N199: Naturalist, September, 1884, p. 867, Fig. 2.]    [Footnote N200: Parry, Second Voyage, Pl. opposite p. 548, Fig.    2.]    [Footnote N201: See Dall, Alaska, p. 387; and Petroff Report,    etc., p. 141. See also the collections of Turner and Fischer from    Attu and Kadiak.]    [Footnote N202: Vega, vol. 2, p. 23, Fig. _b_ on p. 22, and    diagrams, p. 23.]Fig. 50, No. 56492 [108], is a peculiar article of which only onespecimen was collected. We were given to understand at the time ofpurchasing it that it was a sort of socket or escutcheon to befastened to the wall above a lamp to hold the blubber stick describedabove. No such escutcheons, however, were seen in use in the housesvisited. The article is evidently old. It is a flat piece of thickplank of some soft wood, 11.4 inches long, 4.2 broad, and about 1½thick, very rudely carved into a human head and body without arms,with a large round hole about 1¼ inches in diameter through the middleof the breast. The eyes and mouth are incised, and the nose was inrelief, but was long ago split off. There is a deep furrow all aroundthe head, perhaps for fastening on a hood.CLOTHING.MATERIAL.The clothing of these people is as a rule made entirely of skins,though of late years drilling and calico are used for some parts ofthe dress which will be afterwards described. Petroff[N203] makes therather surprising statement that “a large amount of ready-madeclothing finds its way into the hands of these people, who wear it insummer, but the excessive cold of winter compels them to resume thefur garments formerly in general use among them.” Fur garments are inas general use at Point Barrow as they ever were, and the cast-offclothing obtained from the ships is mostly packed away in some cornerof the iglu. We landed at Cape Smyth not long after the wreck of the_Daniel Webster_, whose crew had abandoned and given away a great dealof their clothing. During that autumn a good many men and boys worewhite men’s coats or shirts in place of the outer frock, especiallywhen working or lounging about the station, but by the next springthese were all packed away and were not resumed again except in rareinstances in the summer.    [Footnote N203: Report, etc., p. 125.]The chief material is the skin of the reindeer, which is used invarious stages of pelage. Fine, short-haired summer skins, especiallythose of does and fawns, are used for making dress garments andunderclothes. The heavier skins are used for everyday working clothes,while the heaviest winter skins furnish extra warm jackets for coldweather, warm winter stockings and mittens. The white or spotted skinsof the tame Siberian reindeer, obtained from the “Nunatañmiun,” areespecially valued for full-dress jackets. We heard no mention of theuse of the skin of the unborn reindeer fawn, but there is a kind ofdark deerskin used only for edgings, which appears to be that of anexceedingly young deer. This skin is extremely thin, and the hair soshort that it is almost invisible. Siberian deerskins can always berecognized by having the flesh side colored red,[N204] whileAmerican-dressed skins are worked soft and rubbed with chalk orgypsum, giving a beautiful white surface like pipe-clayed leather.  [Illustration: FIG. 51.--Man in ordinary deerskin clothes]The skins of the white mountain sheep, white and blue fox, wolf, dog,ermine, and lynx are sometimes used for clothing, and under jacketsmade of eider duck skins are rarely used. Sealskin dressed with thehair on is used only for breeches and boots, and for those rarely.Black dressed sealskin--that is, with the epidermis left on and thehair shaved off--is used for waterproof boots, while the whitesealskin, tanned in urine, with the epidermis removed, is used for thesoles of winter boots. Waterproof boot soles are made of oil-dressedskins of the white whale, bearded seal, walrus, or polar bear. Thelast material is not usually mentioned as serving for sole leatheramong the Eskimo. Nordenskiöld,[N205] however, found it in use amongthe Chukches for this purpose. It is considered an excellent materialfor soles at Point Barrow, and is sometimes used to make boat covers,which are beautifully white. Heavy mittens for the winter are made ofthe fur of the polar bear or of dogskin. Waterproof outer frocks areof seal entrails, split and dried and sewed together. For trimmingsare used deerskin of different colors, mountain-sheep skin, and blackand white sealskin, wolf, wolverine, and marten fur, and whole ermineskins, as well as red worsted, and occasionally beads.    [Footnote N204: Compare Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol 2. p. 213.]    [Footnote N205: Vega, vol. 2, p. 98.]STYLE OF DRESS.Dr. Simpson[N206] gave an excellent general description of the dressof these people, which is the same at the present day. While the samein general pattern as that worn by all other Eskimo, it differs inmany details from that worn by the eastern Eskimo,[N207] and mostclosely resembles the style in vogue at and near Norton Sound.[N208]The man’s dress (Fig. 51, from a photograph of Apaidyao) consists ofthe usual loose hooded frock, without opening except at the neck andwrists. This reaches just over the hips, rarely about to mid-thigh,where it is cut off square, and is usually confined by a girdle at thewaist. Under this garment is worn a similar one, usually of lighterskin and sometimes without a hood. The thighs are clad in one or twopairs of tight-fitting knee breeches, confined round the hips by agirdle and usually secured by a drawstring below the knee which tiesover the tops of the boots. On the legs and feet are worn, first,a pair of long, deerskin stockings with the hair inside; then slippersof tanned sealskin, in the bottom of which is spread a layer ofwhalebone shavings, and outside a pair of close-fitting boots, held inplace by a string round the ankle, usually reaching above the knee andending with a rough edge, which is covered by the breeches. Dressboots often end with an ornamental border and a drawstring just belowthe knee. The boots are of reindeer skin, with white sealskin solesfor winter and dry weather, but in summer waterproof boots of blacksealskin with soles of white whale skin, etc., are worn. Overshoes ofthe same material, reaching just above the ankles, with a drawstringat the top and ankle strings, are sometimes worn over the winterboots. When traveling on snowshoes or in soft dry snow the boots arereplaced by stockings of the same shape as the under ones, but made ofvery thick winter deerskins with the flesh side out.    [Footnote N206: Op. cit., pp. 241-245.]    [Footnote N207: See for example, Egede, p. 219; Crantz, vol. 1,    p. 136; Bessels, Op. cit., pp. 805 and 868 (Smith Sound); Kane,    1st Grinnell Exp., pp. 45 (Greenland) and 132 (Cape York);    Brodbeck, “Nach Osten,” pp. 23, 24, and Holm, Geografisk    Tidskrift, vol. 8, p. 90 (East Greenland); Parry, 2d Voy., pp.    494-6 (Iglulik); Boas. “Central Eskimo,” pp. 554-6; Kumlien, loc.    cit., pp. 22-25 (Cumberland Gulf); also, Frobisher, in Hakluyt’s    Voyages, 1589, etc., p. 628.]    [Footnote N208: Dall, Alaska, pp. 21 and 141.]Instead of breeches and boots a man occasionally wears a pair ofpantaloons or tight-fitting trousers terminating in shoes such as areworn by the women. Over the usual dress is worn in very cold weather acircular mantle of deerskin, fastened by a thong at the neck--suchmantles are nowadays occasionally made of blankets--and in rainyweather both sexes wear the hooded rain frock of seal gut. Of lateyears both sexes have adopted the habit of wearing over their clothesa loose hoodless frock of cotton cloth, usually bright-colored calico,especially in blustering weather, when it is useful in keeping thedrifting snow out of their furs.Both men and women wear gloves or mittens. These are of deerskin forordinary use, but in extreme weather mittens of polar bear skin areworn. When hunting in winter it is the custom to wear gloves of thindeerskin under the bearskin mitten, so that the rifle can be handledwithout touching the bare hand to the cold iron. The women have acommon trick of wearing only one mitten, but keeping the other armwithdrawn from the sleeve and inside of the jacket.  [Illustration: FIG. 52.--Woman’s hood.]The dress of the women consists of two frocks, which differ from thoseof the men in being continued from the waist in two rather fullrounded skirts at the front and back, reaching to or below the knee.A woman’s frock is always distinguished by a sort of rounded bulge orpocket at the nape of the neck (see Fig. 52, from a sketch by thewriter), which is intended to receive the head of the infant whencarried in the jacket. The little peak at the top of the hood is alsocharacteristic of the woman’s frock. On her legs a woman wears a pairof tight-fitting deerskin pantaloons with the hair next the skin, andoutside of these a similar pair made of the skins of deer legs, withthe hair out, and having soles of sealskin, but no anklestrings. Theouter pantaloons are usually laid aside in spring, and waterproofboots like the men’s, but fastened below the knee with drawstrings,are worn over the under pantaloons. In the summer pantaloons wholly ofwaterproof sealskin are often put on. The women’s pantaloons, like themen’s breeches, are fastened with a girdle just above the hips. Itappears that they do not stay up very well, as the women arecontinually “hitching” them up and tightening their girdles.Until they reach manhood the boys wear pantaloons like the women, buttheir jackets are cut just like those of the men. The dress of thegirls is a complete miniature of that of the women, even to the pocketfor the child’s head. Those who are well-to-do generally own severalcomplete suits of clothes, and present a neat appearance when notengaged in dirty work. The poorer ones wear one suit on all occasionstill it becomes shabby. New clothes are seldom put on till winter.The outer frock is not often worn in the iglu, being usually taken offbefore entering the room, and the under one is generally dispensedwith. Men habitually leave off their boots in the house, and rarelytheir stockings and breeches, retaining only a pair of thin deerskindrawers. This custom of stripping in the house has been noticed amongall Eskimos whose habits have been described, from Greenland toSiberia. The natives are slow to adopt any modifications in the styleof dress, the excellence and convenience of which has been sofrequently commented upon that it is unnecessary to refer to it. Oneor two youths learned from association with us the convenience ofpockets, and accordingly had “patch pockets” of cloth sewed on theoutside of the skirt of the inner frock, and one young man in 1883wore a pair of sealskin hip boots, evidently copies from ourindia-rubber wading boots. I now proceed to the description of theclothing in detail._Head clothing._--The only head covering usually worn is the hood ofthe frock, which reaches to about the middle of the head, the frontbeing covered by the hair. Women who are carrying children in thejacket sometimes wrap the head in a cloth. (I have an indistinctrecollection of once seeing a woman with a deerskin hood, but was toobusy at the time to make a note or sketch of it.) One man at Utkiavwĭñ(Nägawau´ra, now deceased), who was quite bald on the forehead, usedto protect the front of his head with a sort of false front ofdeerskin, tied round like a fillet. No specimens of any of thesearticles were obtained. Fancy conical caps are worn in the dances andtheatrical performances, but these belong more properly under the headof Games and Pastimes (where they will be described) than under thatof Clothing._Frocks (atigĕ)._--Two frocks are always worn by both sexes except inthe house, or in warm weather, the inner (ílupa) with the hair nextthe skin, and the outer (kalûru´rɐ) with the hair out. The outer frockis also sometimes worn with the hair in, especially when it is new andthe flesh side clean and white. This side is often ornamented withlittle tufts of marten fur and stripes of red ocher. The difference inshape between the frocks of the two sexes has been already mentioned.The man’s frock is a loose shirt, not fitted to the body, widening atthe bottom, and reaching, when unbelted, just below the hips. Theskirts are cut off square or slightly rounded, and are a little longerbehind than in front. The hood is rounded, loose around the neck, andfitted in more on the sides than on the nape. The front edge of thehood, when drawn up, comes a little forward of the top of the head andruns round under the chin, covering the ears.  [Illustration: FIG. 53.--Man’s frock.]  [Illustration: FIG. 54.--Pattern of man’s deerskin frock.]There are in the collection three specimens, all rather elaboratedress frocks, to be worn outside. All have been worn. No. 56751 [184](Fig. 53), brown deerskin, will serve as the type. The pattern canbest be explained by reference to the accompanying diagrams (Fig. 54).The body consists of two pieces, front and back, each made of thegreater part of the skin of a reindeer fawn, with the back in themiddle and the sides and belly coming at the edges. The head of theanimal is made into the hood, which is continuous with the back. Eachsleeve is in two pieces, front and back, of the same shape, which aresewed together along the upper edge, but separated below by the armflap of the front, which is bent down and inserted like a gusset fromthe armpit nearly to the wrist. A band of deerskin an inch broad issewed round the edge of the hood, flesh side out. The trimmingconsists, first, of a narrow strip of long-haired wolfskin (taken fromthe middle of the back) sewed to the outer side of the binding of thehood, its ends separated by the chin piece, so that the long hairsform a fringe around the face. Similar strips are sewed round eachwrist with the fur inward. The binding round the skirt (Fig. 55_a_) is2¼ inches broad. The light-colored strips are clipped mountain sheepskin, the narrow pipings are of the dark brown skin of a very youngfawn, the little tags on the second strip are of red worsted and thefringe is of wolverine fur, sewed on with the flesh side, which iscolored red, probably with ocher, outward. A band of similarmaterials, arranged a little differently (Fig. 55_b_) and 1¼ inchesbroad, is inserted into the body at each shoulder seam, so that thefringe makes a sort of epaulet. This jacket is 24.5 inches long fromthe chin to the bottom of the skirt, 21 inches wide across theshoulders, and 24.5 inches wide at the bottom.  [Illustration: FIG. 55.--Detail of trimming, skirt and shoulder of  man’s frock.]  [Illustration: FIG. 56.--Man wearing plain, heavy frock.]Apart from the trimming this is a very simple pattern. There are noseams except those absolutely necessary for producing the shape, andthe best part of each skin is brought where it will show most, whilethe poorer portions are out of sight under the arms.  [Illustration: FIG. 57.--Man’s frock of mountain sheepskin, front  and back.]The chief variation in deerskin frocks is in the trimming. All havethe hood fitted to the head and throat, with cheek and throat pieces,and these are invariably white or light colored, even when the frockis made of white Siberian deer skin. When possible the head of thedeer is always used for the back of the hood, as Capt. Parry observedto be the custom at Iglulik.[N209] A plain frock is sometimes used forrough work, hunting, etc. This has no fringe or trimming round thehood, skirt, or wrists, the first being smoothly hemmed or bound withdeerskin and the last two left raw-edged. Fig. 56 shows such a jacket,which is often made of very heavy winter deerskin. Most frocks,however, have the border to the hood either of wolf or wolverine skin,in the latter case especially having the end of the strips hangingdown like tassels under the chin. The long hairs give a certain amountof protection to the face when walking in the wind.[N210] Instead of afringe the hood sometimes has three tufts of fur, one on each side andone above.    [Footnote N209: Second Voy., p. 537.]    [Footnote N210: Compare Dall, Alaska, p. 22.]Trimmings of edging like that above described, or of plain wolverinefur round the skirts and wrists, are common, and the shoulder strapsrather less so. Frocks are sometimes also fringed on the skirts andseams with little strips of deerskin, after what the Point Barrowpeople called the “Kûñmûdlĭñ” fashion.[N211] Nearly all the nativeswear outer frocks of deerskin, but on great occasions elaborately madegarments of other materials are sometimes seen. Nos. 56758 [87] (Fig.57, _a_ and _b_) and 56757 [11] (Fig. 58, _a_ and _b_) are two suchfrocks. No. 56758 [87] is of mountain sheep skin, nearly white. Asshown in the diagrams (Fig. 59, _a_, _b_, _c_), the general pattern isnot unlike the type described, but there are more pieces in the hoodand several small gussets are inserted to improve the set of thegarment. The trimmings are shoulder straps, and a border round theskirt of edging like that described above, and the seams of the throatpieces are piped with the dark almost hairless deerskin, which setsthem off from the rest of the coat. The wrists have narrow borders ofwolf fur, and there was a wolfskin fringe to the hood, which wasremoved before the garment was offered for sale.    [Footnote N211: There are several frocks so trimmed in the    National Museum, from the Mackenzie and Anderson region.]  [Illustration: FIG. 58.--Man’s frock of ermine skins, front and  back.]No. 56757 [11] is a very handsome garment (Fig. 58). The body andsleeves are of white and brown (winter and summer) ermine skinsarranged in an elegant pattern, and the hood of reindeer and mountainsheep skin. This is the only frock seen in which the hood is notfitted to the sides of the throat by curved and pointed throat pieces,after the fashion universal among the western Eskimo, from CapeBathurst at least to Norton Sound. The pattern of the hood is shown bythe diagram (Fig. 60 _a_). The middle piece is the skin of a reindeerhead, the two cheek pieces and median chin piece of mountain sheepskin. When the hood is put together the lower edge of it is sewed tothe neck of the body, which has the back and front of nearly the samesize and shape (diagram, Fig. 60 _b_), though the back is a littlelonger in the skirt. There is no regular seam on the shoulders, whereirregular bits of white ermine skin are pieced together so as to fit.From the armpit on each side runs a narrow strip of sheepskin betweenback and front. The sleeve is a long piece made of three white ermineskins put together lengthwise, doubled above, with a straight strip ofsheepskin let in below, and enlarged near the body by two triangulargussets (front and back) let in between the ermine and sheepskin. Thewristbands are broad pieces of sheepskin. The skirts are of whiteermine skins pieced together irregularly, but the skins composing thefront, back, and sleeves are split down the back of the animal andneatly cut into long rectangular pieces, with the feet and tails stillattached. They are arranged in a pattern of vertical stripes, twoskins fastened together end to end making a stripe, which is the sameon the front and the back. There is a brown stripe down the middle,then two white stripes on each side, and a brown stripe on each edge.The hood is bound round the edge with white sheepskin and borderedwith wolfskin. There are shoulder straps and a border round the skirtof edging of the usual materials, but slightly different arrangement,and tagged with small red glass beads.  [Illustration: FIG. 59.--Pattern of sheepskin frock.]  [Illustration: FIG. 60.--Pattern of ermine frock. _a_, hood; _b_,  body.]The former owner of this beautiful frock (since dead) was always veryelegantly dressed. His deerskin clothes were always much trimmed, andhe owned an elegant frock of foxskins, alternately blue and white,with a hood of deerskin, which we did not succeed in obtaining for thecollection. (The “jumper of mixed white and blue fox pelts,” seen byDr. Kane at Ita,[N212] must have been like this.)    [Footnote N212: Second Grinnell Exp., vol. 1, p. 203.]  [Illustration: FIG. 61.--Woman’s frock, front and back.]The woman’s frock differs from that worn by the men, in the shape ofthe hood and skirts, as mentioned above, and it is also slightlyfitted in to the waist and made to “bag” somewhat in the back, inorder to give room for carrying the child. The pattern is considerablydifferent from that of the man’s frock, as will be seen from thedescription of the type specimen (the only one in the collection), No.74041 [1791] (Fig. 61, _a_ and _b_), which is of deerskin. The hood israised into a little point on top and bulges out into a sort ofrounded pocket at the nape. This is a holiday garment, made of stripsof skin from the shanks and belly of the reindeer, pieced together soas to make a pattern of alternating light and dark stripes. Thepattern is shown in the diagram, Fig. 62. The sleeves are of the samepattern as those of No. 56751 [184]. The edge of the hood is boundwith deerskin, hair outwards. Trimming: a strip of edging (Fig. 63) inwhich the light stripes are clipped white mountain sheepskin, the darkpipings brown, almost hairless, fawnskin, and the tags red worsted, isinserted in the seam between 7 on each side and 6 and 2, and a similarstrip between the inner edge of 3, 2, 7, 9, and 1. A broader strip ofsimilar insertion, fringed below with marten fur, with the flesh sideout and colored red, runs along the short seam _ffff_. The seambetween 9 and 7 has a narrow piping of thin brown deerskin, taggedwith red worsted. A strip of edging, without tags and fringed withmarten fur (Fig. 64), is inserted in the seam _gggg_. The border ofthe skirt is 1 inch wide (Fig. 64). The dark stripe is brown deerskin,the white, mountain sheep, and the fur, marten, with the red fleshside out. The fringes are double strips of white deerskin sewed to theinside of the last seam, about 3 inches apart. The shoulder straps areof edging like that at _g_, but have the fur sewed on so as to showthe red flesh side. The hood has a fringe of wolfskin sewed to theoutside of the binding. This frock measures 45 inches in the back, 32in the front, 19 across the shoulders, and 17 at the waist. The skirtsare 21 inches wide, the front 18, and the back 20 inches long. Thepieces 7, 8, and 9 of the hood are white. This is an unusuallyhandsome garment.  [Illustration: FIG. 62.--Pattern of woman’s frock.]  [Illustration: FIG. 63.--Detail of edging, woman’s frock.]  [Illustration: FIG. 64.--Details of trimming, woman’s frock.]Deerskin garments rarely have the ornamental piecing seen in thisfrock. Each one of the numbered parts of the pattern is generally inone piece. The pieces 8 and 9 are almost universally white, and 7 isoften so. About the same variety in material and trimming is to befound as in the men’s frocks, though deer and mountain sheep skinswere the only materials seen used, and the women’s frocks are lessoften seen without the fringe round the hood. Plain deerskin frocksare often bordered round the skirts with a fringe cut from deerskin.The women nowadays often line the outer frock with drilling, brightcalico, or even bedticking, and then wear it with this side out.The frocks for both sexes, while made on the same general pattern asthose of the other Eskimo, differ in many details from those ofeastern America. For instance, the hood is not fitted in round thethroat with the pointed throat pieces or fringed with wolf orwolverine skin until we reach the Eskimo of the Anderson River. Here,as shown by the specimens in the National Museum, the throat piecesare small and wide apart, and the men’s hoods only are fringed withwolverine skin. The women’s hoods are very large everywhere in theeast for the better accommodation of the child, which is sometimescarried wholly in the hood.[N213]    [Footnote N213: Egede, p. 131; Crantz, i, p. 137 and Pl. III.    (Greenland); Bessels, op. cit., p. 865 (Smith Sound--married women    only); Parry, 2nd Voy., p. 491, and numerous illustrations, passim    (Iglulik); Packard. Naturalist Vol. 19, p. 6, Pl. XXIII    (Labrador), and Kumlien, l. c., p. 33 (Cumberland Gulf). See also    several specimens in the National Museum from Ungava (collected by    L. M. Turner) and the Mackenzie and Anderson rivers (collected by    MacFarlane). The hoods from the last region, while still much    larger and wider than those in fashion at Point Barrow, are not so    enormous as the more eastern ones. The little peak on the top of    the woman’s hood at Point Barrow may be a reminiscence of the    pointed hood worn by the women mentioned by Bessels, op. cit.]The hind flap of the skirt of the woman’s frock, except in Greenland,has developed into a long narrow train reaching the ground, while thefront flap is very much decreased in size (see references justquoted). The modern frock in Greenland is very short and has verysmall flaps (see illustrations in Rink’s Tales, etc., pp. 8 and 9),but the ancient fashion, judging from the plate in Crantz’s History ofGreenland, referred to above, was much more like that worn by thewestern Eskimo. In the Anderson and Mackenzie regions the flaps areshort and rounded and the front flap considerably the smaller. Thereis less difference in the general shape of the men’s frocks. The hoodis generally rounded and close fitting, except in Labrador and BaffinLand, where it is pointed on the crown. The skirt is sometimesprolonged into rounded flaps and a short scallop in front, as atIglulik and some parts of Baffin Land.[N214] Petitot[N215] gives afull description of the dress of a “chief” from the Anderson River. Hecalls the frock a “blouse échancrée par côté et terminée en queuesarrondies par devant et par derrière.” The style of frock worn atPoint Barrow is the prevalent one along the western coast of Americanearly to the Kuskokwim. On this river long hoodless frocks reachingnearly or quite to the ground are worn.[N216] The frock worn in Kadiakwas hoodless and long, with short sleeves and large armholes beneaththese.[N217]    [Footnote N214: Parry, 2d Voy., p. 494, and 1st Voy., p. 283.]    [Footnote N215: Monographic, etc., p. xiv.]    [Footnote N216: Petroff, op. cit., p. 134, Pls. 4 and 5. See also    specimens in the National Museum.]    [Footnote N217: Petroff, op. cit., p. 139, and Liscansky, Voy.,    etc., p. 194.]The men of the Siberian Eskimo and sedentary Chukches, as at PloverBay, wear in summer a loose straight-bottomed frock without a hood,but with a frill of long fur round the neck. The winter frock isdescribed as having “a square hood without trimmings, but capable ofbeing drawn, like the mouth of a bag, around the face by a stringinserted in the edge.”[N218] According to Nordenskiöld,[N219] the menat Pitlekaj wear the hoodless frock summer and winter, putting on oneor two separate hoods in winter. The under hood appears to be like oneor two which I saw worn at Plover Bay, namely, a close-fittingnightcap of thin reindeer skin tied under the chin. The dress of theSiberian women consists of frock and baggy kneebreeches in one piece,sewed to tightfitting boots reaching to the knees.[N220]    [Footnote N218: Dall, Alaska, p. 379.]    [Footnote N219: Vega, vol. 2, p. 98.]    [Footnote N220: Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2, p. 100 and Fig. on    p. 57; Dall, Alaska, p. 379 and plate opposite. I also noticed    this dress at Plover Bay in 1881. Compare also Krause Brothers,    Geogr. Blätter, vol. 5, No. 1, p. 5, where the dress along the    coast from East Cape to Plover Bay is described as we saw it at    Plover Bay.]_Mantles._--“Circular” mantles of deerskin, fastened at the neck by athong, and put on over the head like a poncho, are worn by the men invery cold weather over their other clothes when lounging in the openair about the village or watching at a seal hole or tending the sealnets at night. The cloaks are especially affected by the older men,who, having grown-up sons or sons-in-law, do not have to go sealing inwinter, and spend a great deal of their time in bright weatherchatting together out of doors. There is one specimen in thecollection, No. 56760 [94] (Fig. 65). It is made of fine summerdoe-reindeer skin, in three pieces, back and two sides of dark skin,sewed to a collar of white skin from the belly of the animal. Forpattern see diagram (Fig. 66). The seams at _a_ are gored to make thecloak hang properly from the shoulder. The collar is in two pieces,joined in the middle, and the edge _c_ is turned over toward the hairside and “run” down in a narrow hem. The points _b_ of the collar arebrought together in the middle and joined by a little strap ofdeerskin about an inch long, so that the edge _c_ makes a round holefor the neck. The width of the mantle is 60 inches and its depth 39.It is worn with the white flesh side out, as is indicated by the seamsbeing sewed “over and over” on the hair side. All the mantles seenwere essentially of the same pattern. The edge is sometimes cut intoan ornamental fringe, and the flesh side marked with a few narrowstripes of red ocher. This garment appears to be peculiar tonorthwestern America. No mention is to be found of any such a thingexcept in Mr. MacFarlane’s MS. notes, where he speaks of a deerskinblanket “attached with a line across the shoulders in cold weather,”among the Anderson River Eskimo. We have no means at present ofknowing whether such cloaks are worn by the coast natives betweenPoint Barrow and Kotzebue Sound, but one was worn by one of theNunata´ñmiun who were at Nuwŭk in the autumn of 1881.  [Illustration: FIG. 65.--Man’s cloak of deerskin.]  [Illustration: FIG. 66.--Pattern of man’s cloak.]_Rain-frocks._--The rain-frock (silû´ña) is made of strips of seal orwalrus intestines about 3 inches broad, sewed together edge to edge.This material is light yellowish brown, translucent, very light, andquite waterproof. In shape the frock resembles a man’s frock, but thehood comes well forward and fits closely round the face. It isgenerally plain, but the seams are nowadays sewed with black orcolored cotton for ornament. The garment is of the same shape for bothsexes, but the women frequently cover the flesh side of a deerskinfrock with strips of entrail sewed together vertically, thus making agarment at once waterproof and warm, which is worn alone in summerwith the hair side in. These gut shirts are worn over the clothes insummer when it rains or when the wearer is working in the boats. Thereare no specimens in the collection.The kaiak jacket of black sealskin, so universal in Greenland, isunknown at Point Barrow. The waterproof gut frocks are peculiar to thewestern Eskimo, though shirts of seal gut, worn between the inner andouter frock, are mentioned by Egede (p. 130) and Crantz[N221] as usedin Greenland in their time. Ellis also[N222] says: “Some few of them[i.e., the Eskimo of Hudsons Strait] wear shifts of seals’ bladders,sewed together in pretty near the same form with those in Europe.”They have been described generally under the name _kamleïka_ (said tobe a Siberian word) by all the authors who have treated of the nativesof this region, Eskimo, Siberians, or Aleuts. We saw them worn bynearly all the natives at Plover Bay. One handsome one was observedtrimmed on the seams with rows of little red nodules (pieces of thebeak of one of the puffins) and tiny tufts of black feathers.    [Footnote N221: Vol. 1, p. 137.]    [Footnote N222: Voyage to Hudsons Bay, p. 136.]The cotton frock, already alluded to as worn to keep the driving snowout of the furs, is a long, loose shirt reaching to about midleg, witha round hole at the neck large enough to admit the head. This isgenerally of bright-colored calico, but shirts of white cotton aresometimes worn when hunting on the ice or snow. Similar frocks areworn by the natives at Pitlekaj.[N223]    [Footnote N223: Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2, p. 98.]ARM CLOTHING._Mittens._--The hands are usually protected by mittens (aitkă´ti) ofdifferent kinds of fur. The commonest kind are of deerskin, worn withthe flesh side out. Of these the collection contains one pair, No.89828 [973] (Fig. 67). They are made of thick winter reindeer skin,with the white flesh side outward, in the shape of ordinary mittensbut short and not narrowed at the wrists, with the thumb short andclumsy. The seams are all sewed “over and over” on the hair side.These mittens are about 7½ inches long and 4½ broad. The free part ofthe thumb is only 2¼ inches long on the outer side. Such mittens arethe ordinary hand covering of men, women, and children. In extremecold weather or during winter hunting, very heavy mittens of the sameshape, but gathered to a wristband, are worn. These are made of whitebearskin for men and women, for children of dogskin, with the hairout. When the hand covered with such a mitten is held upon thewindward side of the face in walking, the long hair affords a veryefficient protection against the wind. The long stiff hair of thebearskin also makes the mitten a very convenient brush for removingsnow and hoar frost from the clothes. It is even sometimes used forbrushing up the floor.  [Illustration: FIG. 67.--Deerskin mittens]In the MacFarlane collection are similar mittens from the Mackenzieregion. Petitot[N224] says the Anderson River “chief” wore pualuk“mitaines en peau de morse, aussi blanches et aussi soyeuses que debelle laine.” These were probably of bearskin, as a mitten of walrusskin is not likely to be “blanche” or “soyeuse.” Gloves are worn underthese as at Point Barrow. All these mittens are short in the wrist,barely meeting the frock sleeve, and leaving a crack for the cold toget in, which is partially covered by the usual wolf or wolverine skinfringe of the sleeve. I have already mentioned the common habit amongthe women of carrying only one mitten and drawing one arm inside ofthe frock.[N225] The men, except when hunting, frequently wear onlyone of these heavy mittens, which are called pu´alu. Waterproofmittens of black sealskin, coming well up over the forearm, were alsoobserved, but not obtained. I do not remember ever seeing them in use.    [Footnote N224: Monographie, etc., p. xv.]    [Footnote N225: Compare Parry, 2d Voy., p. 494, where a similar    habit is mentioned at Iglulik.]  [Illustration: FIG. 68.--Deerskin gloves.]_Gloves._--Gloves of thin deerskin, worn with the hair in, and oftenelegantly ornamented, are used with full dress, especially at thedances. As already stated, the men wear such gloves under the pualuwhen shooting in the winter. When ready to shoot, the hunter slips offthe mitten and holds it between his legs, while the glove enables himto cock the rifle and draw the trigger without touching the cold metalwith his bare hands. There are two pairs of gloves in the collection.No. 89829 [974] (Fig. 68) illustrates a very common style calleda´drigûdrĭn. They are made of thin reindeer skin, with the white fleshside out, and are rights and lefts. The short and rather clumsyfingers and thumbs are separate pieces from the palm, which is onestraight, broad piece, doubled so as to bring the seam on the sameside as the thumb. The thumbs are not alike on both hands. The outsidepiece of the thumb runs down to the wrist on the left glove, but isshorter on the right, the lower 2 inches of the edge seam beingbetween the edges of the palm piece. Each finger is a single piecedoubled lengthwise and sewed over the tip and down one side. Thewrists are ornamented with an edging of two narrow strips of clippedmountain sheep skin, bordered with a narrow strip of wolverine furwith the reddened flesh side out. These gloves were made for sale andare not well mated, one being 8½ inches, with fingers (all of the samelength) 4½ inches long, while the other is 8 inches long with fingersof 3½ inches. No. 56747 [128] is a pair of gloves made in the same waybut more elaborately ornamented. There is a band of deerskin but nofringe round the wrist. The back of the hand is covered with browndeerskin, hair out, into which is inserted the square ornamentalpattern in which the light stripes are white deerskin and the darkpipings the usual almost hairless fawnskin. Gloves like this type arethe most common and almost universally have a fringe round the wrist.They are also usually a little longer-wristed than the mittens.Mittens are universally employed among the Eskimo, but gloves withfingers, which, as is well known, are a much less warm covering forthe hand than mittens, are very rare. They are in use at NortonSound[N226] and in the Mackenzie district[N227], and have even beenobserved among the Arctic Highlanders of Smith Sound, who, however,generally wear mittens[N228]. Dr. Simpson[N229] mentions both deerskinand bearskin mittens as used at Point Barrow, but makes no referenceto gloves. The natural inference from this is that the fashion ofwearing gloves has been introduced since his time. It is quiteprobable that the introduction of firearms has favored the generaladoption of gloves. The following hypothesis may be suggested as tothe way the fashion reached Point Barrow: We may suppose that theMalimiut of Norton Sound got the idea directly from the Russians. Theywould carry the fashion to the Nunatañmiun at Kotzebue Sound, who intheir turn would teach it to the Point Barrow traders at the Colville,and these would carry it on to the eastern natives.    [Footnote N226: Dall, Alaska, pp. 23, 152, and 153. He speaks of    the thumb (p. 23) as “a triangular, shapeless protuberance”;    a description which applies well to those in our collection.]    [Footnote N227: MacFarlane MS., and Petitot, Monographie, etc.,    p. xv.]    [Footnote N228: Bessels, Naturalist, vol. 18, p. 865.]    [Footnote N229: Op. cit., p. 242.]  [Illustration: FIG. 69.--Man’s breeches of deerskin]LEG AND FOOT CLOTHING._Breeches (kă´kli)._--The usual leg-covering of the men is one or twopairs of knee breeches, rather loose, but fitted to the shape of theleg. They are very low in front, barely covering the pubes, but run upmuch higher behind, sometimes as high as the small of the back. Theyare held in place by a girdle of thong round the waist, and areusually fastened below the knee, over the boots, by a drawstring.There is one pair in the collection, No. 56759 [91], Fig. 69. They areof short-haired brown reindeer skin, from the body of the animal, wornwith the hair out. The waist is higher behind than in front, and eachleg is slightly gathered to a band just below the knee. Pattern (seediagram, Fig. 70): There are two pieces in each leg, the inside andthe outside. The spaces between the edges _e_ of the two legs is filledby the gusset, made of five pieces, which covers the pubes. The crotchis reinforced by a square patch of white deerskin sewed on the inside.The trimming consists of strips of edging. The first strip (Fig. 71)is 1½ inches wide, and runs along the front seam, inserted in theoutside piece, to the knee-band, beginning 5 inches from the waist.The light strips are of clipped mountain sheepskin; the dark one ofdark brown deerskin; the pipings of the thin fawn skin, and the tagsof red worsted. The edges of the strip are fringed with narrow doublestrips of mountain sheepskin 2 inches long, put on about 1½ inchesapart. A straight strip, 2 inches wide, is inserted obliquely acrossthe outside piece from seam to seam. It is of the same materials, butdiffers slightly in pattern. The knee-band is of the same materialsand 2½ inches deep. The length from waist to knee is 24 inches behind,23 in front; the girth of the leg 24 inches round the thigh and 14round the knee. These represent a common style of full-dress breeches,and are worn with a pair of trimmed boots held up by drawstrings. Theyare always worn with the hair out and usually over a pair of deerskindrawers. The ordinary breeches are of heavier deerskin, made perfectlyplain, being usually worn alone, with the hair turned in. When a pairof under breeches is worn, however, the hair of the outer ones isturned out. Trimmed breeches are less common than trimmed frocks, asthe plain breeches when new are often worn for full dress. The clean,white flesh side presents a very neat appearance. The skin of therough seal is sometimes, but rarely, used for summer breeches, whichare worn with the hair out. With this exception, breeches seem to beinvariably made of deerskin. This garment is practically universalamong the Eskimo and varies very little in pattern.  [Illustration: FIG. 70.--Pattern of man’s breeches.]  [Illustration: FIG. 71.--Trimming of man’s breeches. 3/8]_Pantaloons (kûmûñ)._--The women and children, and occasionally themen, wear pantaloons (strictly speaking), i.e., tight-fitting trouserscontinuous with the foot covering. Of the two pairs of pantaloons inthe collection, No. 74042 [1792] (Fig. 72) will serve as the type. Theshoes with sealskin moccasin soles and deerskin uppers are sewed atthe ankles to a pair of tight-fitting deerskin trousers, reachingabove the hips and higher behind than in front. Pattern (diagram, Fig.73_a_): Each leg is composed of four long pieces (front 1, outside 2,back 3, and inside 4), five gussets (one on the thigh 5, and four onthe calf, 6, 6, 6, 6), which enlarges the garment to fit the swell ofthe calf and thigh and the half-waistband (7). The two legs are puttogether by joining the edges _d d d_ of the opposite legs and sewingthe gusset (8) into the space in front with its base joined to theedges _e e_ of the two legs. The sole of each shoe is a single pieceof white tanned sealskin with the grain side out, bent up about 1¼inches all round the foot, rounded at the toe and heel and broadestacross the ball of the foot. The toe and heel are “gathered” intoshape by crimping the edge vertically. A space of about 3½ inches isleft uncrimped on each side of the foot. (The process of crimpingthese soles will be described under the head of boots and shoes, whereit properly belongs). Around the top of this sole is sewed a narrowband of white sealskin, sewed “over and over” on the edge of theuncrimped space, but “run” through the gathers at the ends, so as todraw them up. The upper is in two pieces (heel, 9, and toe, 10). Theheel piece is folded round the heel, and the toe piece doubled alongthe line _f_, and the curved edges _g g_ joined to the straight edges_h h_, which makes the folded edge _f_, fit the outline of the instep.The bottom is then cut off accurately to fit the sole and sewed to theedge of the band. The trousers and shoes are sewed together at theankles. The whole is made of the short-haired skin from the deer’slegs. Pieces 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are of dark brown skin (10 put onso that the tuft of coarse hair on the deer’s ankle comes on theoutside of the wearer’s ankle), while the remaining pieces are white,making a pleasing pattern of broad stripes. The inner edge of 5 ispiped with dark brown fawnskin, and a round piece of white skin isinserted at the bottom of 2. No. 56748 [136] is a pair of pantaloonsof nearly the same pattern (see diagram, Fig. 73_b_) and put togetherin a similar way. These pantaloons have soles of sealskin with thehair left on and worn inside, and are made of deer leg skin, whollydark brown, except the gussets on the calf, which are white. There isa piece of white skin let out, 2, as before, and the ankle tuft is inthe same position.  [Illustration: FIG. 72.--Woman’s pantaloons.]From the general fit of these garments they appear to be all made onessentially the same pattern, probably without greater variations thanthose already described. When worn by the women the material isusually, if not always, the skin of reindeer legs, and most commonlyof the pattern of No. 56748 [136], namely, brown, with white leggussets. Pantaloons wholly of brown skin are quite common, especiallyfor everyday wear, while striped ones, like No. 74042 [1792], are muchless usual and worn specially for full dress. Children’s pantaloonsare always brown, and I have seen one pair, worn by a young lad, oflynx skin. The two or three pairs which we saw worn by men were whollybrown. These pantaloons of leg skin with sealskin soles are alwaysworn with the hair out and usually over a pair of under pantaloons ofthe same shape, but made of softer skins with longer hair, which isworn next the skin, and with stocking feet. The outer pantaloons arediscarded in summer and the inner ones only worn, the feet beingprotected by sealskin waterproof boots, as already stated. Thewaterproof sealskin pantaloons mentioned in the same connection do notfit so neatly, as they are made with as few seams as possible (usuallyonly one, up the leg) to avoid leakage. They are sewed with thewaterproof seam, and held up round the ankle by strings, like thewaterproof boots to be described further on. This last-mentionedgarment seems to be peculiar to the Point Barrow region (includingprobably Wainwright Inlet and perhaps the rest of the coast down toKotzebue Sound). No mention of such a complete protection against wetis to be found in any of the published accounts of the Eskimoelsewhere, nor are there any specimens in the Museum.[N230]  [Illustration: FIG. 73.--Patterns of woman’s pantaloons.]    [Footnote N230: Dr. Simpson’s language (op. cit., p. 243) is a    little indefinite (“The feet and legs are incased in water-tight    sealskin boots”), but probably refers to these as well as to the    knee boots. The “outside coat of the same material,” and the boots    and outside coat “made all in one, with a drawing string round the    face,” mentioned in the same place, appears to have gone wholly    out of fashion since his time. At all events, we saw neither,    though we continually saw the natives when working in the boats,    and these garments, especially the latter, could hardly have    failed to attract our attention.]Boots and breeches united in this way so as to form pantaloons arepeculiar to the west of America, where they are universally worn fromthe Mackenzie district westward and southward. We have no specimens ofwomen’s leg coverings from the Mackenzie district, but Petitot[N231]describes them thus: “Le pantalon * * * fait corps avec la chaussure.”In the east the women always wear breeches separate from the boots,which usually differ from those of the men in their size and length,often reaching to the hips.[N232]    [Footnote N231: Monographie, etc., p. xv.]    [Footnote N232: Bessels, Naturalist, vol. 18, p. 865, Smith Sound;    Egede, p. 131, and Crantz, vol. 1, p. 138, Greenland; Parry, 2d    Voy., p. 495 and 496, Iglulik, and Kumlien, op. cit., p. 23,    Cumberland Gulf. Also in Labrador, see Pl. XVII, Naturalist, vol.    19, No. 6. The old couple whom Franklin met at the Bloody Fall of    the Coppermine appear to have worn pantaloons, for he speaks of    their “tight leggings sewed to shoes” (1st Exp., vol. 2, p. 180).]  [Illustration: FIG. 74.--Pattern of stocking.]_Stockings._--Next to the skin on the feet and legs the men wearstockings of deerskin, usually of soft, rather long-haired skin, withthe hair in. These are usually in three pieces, the leg, 1, toe piece,2, and sole, 3 (see diagram, Fig. 74). A straight strip about 1 inchwide often runs round the foot between the sole and the other pieces.Stockings of this pattern, but made of very thick winter deerskin, aresubstituted for the outer boots when deer-hunting in winter in the drysnow, especially when snowshoes are used. They are warm; the fleshside sheds the snow well and the thick hair acts as a sort of waddingwhich keeps the feet from being galled by the bars and strings of thesnowshoes. Many of the deer-hunters in 1883 made rough buskins of thispattern out of the skins of freshly killed deer simply dried, withoutfurther preparation._Boots and shoes._--Over the stockings are worn boots or shoes withuppers of various kinds of skin, with the hair on, or black tannedsealskin, always fitted to heelless crimped moccasin soles of somedifferent leather, of the pattern which, with some slightmodifications of form, is universal among the Eskimo. These soles aremade as follows: A “blank” for the sole is cut out, of the shape ofthe foot, but a couple of inches larger all round. Then, beginning atone side of the ball of the foot, the toe part is doubled over towardthe inside of the sole, so that the edges just match. The two partsare then pinched together with the teeth along a line parallel to thefolded edge and at a distance from it equal to the depth of theintended fold. This bitten line runs from the edge of the leather asfar as it is intended to turn up the side of the sole. A series ofsimilar folds is carried round the toe to a point on the other side ofthe sole opposite the starting point. In the same way a series ofcrimps is carried round the heel, leaving an uncrimped space of 2 or 3inches on each side of the foot. The sole is then sewed to a band orto the edge of the upper, with the thread run through each fold of thecrimps. This gathers the sole in at the heel and toe and brings theuncrimped part straight up on each side of the shank. When the foldsare all of the same length and but slightly gathered the sole isturned up nearly straight, as at the heel usually, and at the toe alsoof waterproof boots. When the folds are long and much gathered thesole slopes well in over the foot. Some boots, especially thoseintended for full dress, have the sole deeper on the sides than at thetoe, so that the top of the sole comes to a point at the toe. Theordinary pattern is about the same height all round and follows theshape of the foot, being rather more gathered in over the toe than atthe heel. The “blank” for the sole is cut out by measuring the size ofthe foot on the leather and allowing by eye the margin which is to beturned up. The crimping is also done by eye. Any irregularity in thelength of the crimps can be remedied by pressing out the crease.I have never seen at Point Barrow the ivory knives, such as are usedat Norton Sound for arranging the crimps.  [Illustration: FIG. 75.--Man’s boot of deerskin.]  [Illustration: FIG. 76.--Pattern of deerskin boot.]Different kinds of leather are used for the soles, and each kind issupposed to be best suited for a particular purpose. The beautifulwhite urine-tanned sealskin is used for winter wear when the snow isdry, but is not suited for standing the roughness and dampness of thesalt-water ice. For this purpose sealskin dressed with the hair on andworn flesh side out is said to be the very best, preferable even tothe various waterproof skins used for summer boot soles. Forwaterproof soles are used oil-dressed skins[N233] of the walrus,bearded seal, polar bear, or, best of all, the white whale. This lastmakes a beautiful light yellow translucent leather about 0.1 inchthick, which is quite durable and keeps out water for a long time. Itis highly prized and quite an article of trade among the natives,a pair of soles usually commanding a good price. These Eskimo appearto be the only ones who have discovered the excellence of thismaterial for waterproof soles, as there is no mention to be found ofits use elsewhere. The “narwhal skin” spoken of by Dr. Simpson[N234]is probably this material, as he calls it “Kel-lel´-lu-a,” which isthe ordinary word for white whale at Point Barrow. The narwhal is veryrare in these waters, while the white whale is comparatively abundant.Dr. Simpson appears not to have seen the animal from which the skinwas obtained. It is, however, by no means impossible that _some_ skinsof the narwhal, which when dressed would be indistinguishable from thewhite whale skins, are obtained from the eastern natives or elsewhere.Such crimped soles are in use among the Eskimo everywhere, varying butlittle in general pattern. The Greenland boots are speciallynoticeable for the neatness of the crimping, while specimens in theMuseum from the central region are decidedly slovenly in theirworkmanship. The boots worn by the natives of Plover Bay have the solenarrowed at the shank and hardly coming over the foot except at thetoe and heel, where they are crimped, but less deeply than usual. Thisstyle of sole very much resembles those of a pair of Kamchatdale bootsin the National Museum, which, however, are turned up withoutcrimping, as is the case with the boots used by the Aleuts on theCommander Islands, of which Dr. L. Stejneger has kindly shown me aspecimen. There is a folded “welt” of sealskin in the seam between theupper and sole of the Plover Bay boots. I am informed by Capt.Herendeen that the natives have been taught to put this in by thewhalemen who every year purchase large numbers of boots on theSiberian coast, for use in the Arctic. Similar welts, which are veryunusual on Eskimo boots, are to be seen on some brought by Mr. Nelsonfrom Kings Island and Norton Sound. The winter boots usually haveuppers of deerskin, generally the short-haired skin from the legs.Mountain-sheep skin is sometimes used for full-dress boots, andsealskin with the hair out for working boots. The latter is not a goodmaterial, as the snow sticks to it badly. There are four pairs ofmen’s winter boots in the collection, from which No. 56750 [111](Fig. 75) has been selected as the type of the everyday pattern. Theyare made of deer-leg skin with white sealskin soles. Leg and upper arein four pieces,[N235] back 1, two sides 2 2, and front 3; 1 and 3 aregored at _a a a_ to fit the swell of the calf; 1 and 3 are of darkskin, and 2 2 lighter colored, especially along the middle. The bottomis cut off accurately to fit the sole but the top is left irregular,as this is concealed by the breeches. The boots are held up round theankles by two tie-strings of sealthong, sewed in between the sole andthe band, one on each side just under the middle of the ankle. Theyare long enough to cross above the heel, pass once or twice round theankle, which fits more loosely than the rest of the boot, and tie infront. On each heel is a large round patch of sealskin with the hairon and pointing toward the toe (to prevent slipping). These patchesare carefully “blind-stitched” on so that the stitches do not show onthe outside.    [Footnote N233: Probably prepared like the boat covers described    by Crantz, vol. 1, p. 167, by drying them without removing all of    their own blubber.]    [Footnote N234: Op. cit., pp. 242-266.]    [Footnote N235: See diagram, Fig. 76.]  [Illustration: FIG. 77.--Man’s dress boot of deerskin.]Boots of this style are the common everyday wear of the men, sometimesmade wholly of dark deerskin and sometimes variegated. They are oftenmade of a pattern like that of the lower part of the women’spantaloons; that is, with the uppers separate from the leg pieces,which are brown, with four white gussets on the calf. Fig. 77, No.56759 [91], is one of a pair of full-dress boots of a slightlydifferent pattern. The leg pieces are the same in number as in No.56750, and put together in the same way, but 2 and 3 are of adifferent shape.[N236] They are made of deer-leg skins, each piecewith a lighter streak down the middle. The soles are of whitesealskin, finely crimped, with the edge coming to a point at the toe,and the five ornamental bands are of sealskin, alternately black andwhite. A strip of edging three-fourths of an inch wide is inserted inthe seam between 2 and 3 on each side. The light stripes aremountain-sheep skin and the dark ones the usual young fawnskin, taggedwith red worsted. The leg reaches to just below the knee, and ishemmed over on the inside, to hold the drawstring, which comes outbehind. There are strings at the ankles as before.    [Footnote N236: See diagram, Fig. 78.]  [Illustration: FIG. 78.--Pattern of man’s dress boot of deerskin.]Fig. 79, No. 89834 [770], is one of a pair of almost precisely thesame pattern as the last, but made of mountain-sheep skin. The solesare more deeply turned up all round and have three ornamental bands ofsealskin around the edge, black, white, and black. Edging is insertedinto both the seams on each side. It is strips of mountain-sheep skinand a dark brown deerskin, tagged with red worsted, with the edgewhich laps over the side piece cut into oblique tags. There are notiestrings, as the soles are turned up high enough to stay in placewithout them. These boots were brought from the east by one of theNuwŭk trading parties in 1882. Fig. 80, No. 56749 [110], is also afull-dress boot, with soles like the last and no tiestrings. The legis of two pieces of dark brown deerskin with the hair clipped short.These pieces are shaped like 2 in No. 56750, and the inner is larger,so that it laps round the leg, bringing the seam on the outside. Theleg is enlarged to fit the swell of the calf by a large triangulargusset from the knee to the midleg, meeting the inside piece in anoblique seam across the calf. Instead of a hem, the top of the leg hasa half-inch band sewed round it and a binding for the drawstring abovethis. Edging is inserted in the front seam, and obliquely across theoutside of the leg. That in the front seam is three narrow strips ofdeerskin, dark in the middle and light on each side. The other is ofmountain-sheep skin in three strips, piped with fawnskin and taggedwith worsted.  [Illustration: FIG. 79.--Man’s dress boot of skin of  mountain-sheep.]The boots belong with the breeches, No. 56759. They fairly representthe style of full-dress boots worn with the loose-bottomed breeches.They all have drawstrings just below the knee, and often have notie-strings at the ankles. The eastern Eskimo are everywhere describedas wearing the boots tied at the top with a drawstring and the bottomsof the breeches usually loose and hanging down on them. Tying down thebreeches over the tops of the boots, as is done at Point Barrow, is animprovement on the eastern fashion, as it closes the garments at theknee so as to prevent the entrance of cold air. The same result isobtained in an exactly opposite way by the people of Smith Sound, who,according to Bessels (Naturalist, vol. 18, p. 865), tie the boots overthe breeches.All fur garments, including boots, are sewed in the same way, usuallywith reindeer sinew, by fitting the edges together and sewing them“over and over” on the “wrong” side. The waterproof boots of blacksealskin, however, are sewed with an elaborate double seam, which isquite waterproof, and is made as follows: The two pieces are puttogether, flesh side to flesh side, so that the edge of one projectsbeyond the other, which is then “blind-stitched” down by sewing it“over and over” on the edge, taking pains to run the stitches onlypart way through the other piece. The seam is then turned and the edgeof the outer piece is turned in and “run” down to the grain side ofthe under with fine stitches which do not run through to the fleshside of it. Thus in neither seam are there holes through both piecesat once. The sewing is done with fine sinew thread and very fine roundneedles (the women used to ask for “little needles, like a hair”), andthe edge of the leather is softened by wetting it in the mouth.A similar waterproof seam is used in sewing together boat covers.  [Illustration: FIG. 80.--Pair of man’s dress boots of deerskin.]There is one pair of waterproof boots in the collection (No. 76182[1794] Fig. 81). The tops are of black dressed sealskin, reaching tothe knee and especially full on the instep and ankle, which resultsfrom their being made with the least possible number of seams, toreduce the chance of leaking. The soles are of white whale skin,turned up about 1½ inches all around. The leg and upper are made allin one piece so that the double water-tight seam runs down the frontof the leg to the instep, and then diagonally across the foot to thequarter on one side. The bottom is cut off accurately to fit the topof the sole. The edges of the upper and the sole are put together sothat the inside of the former comes against the inside of the latter,and the two are “run” together with fine stitches, with a stout doubleunder-thread running through them along the surface of the upper. Theornamental band at the top is of white sealskin “run” on with strongdark thread, and the checkered pattern is made by drawing a strip ofblack skin through slits in the white. Round the top of the band issewed a binding of black sealskin, which holds a drawstring of sinewbraid. The sole is kept up in shape and the boot made to fit round theankle by a string of sealskin twine passed through four loops, one oneach side just back of the ball of the foot, and one on each quarter.These loops are made of little strips of white whale skin, doubledover and sewed to the edge of the sole on the outside. The ends of thestring are passed through the front loop so that the bight comesacross the ball of the foot, then through the hinder loops, and arecrossed above the heel, carried once or twice around the ankle, andtied in front.  [Illustration: FIG. 81.--Woman’s waterproof sealskin boot.]Such boots are universally worn in summer. The men’s boots are usuallyleft with an irregular edge at the top, and are held up by thebreeches, while the women’s usually have white bands around the topswith drawstrings. Half-boots of the same material, reaching to midleg,without drawstrings, or shoes reaching just above the ankle with astring round the top are sometimes worn over the deerskin boots.Similar shoes of deerskin are sometimes worn in place of boots.Waterproof boots of black sealskin are universally employed by Eskimoand by the Aleuts. These boots stand water for a long time withoutgetting wet through, but when they become wet they must be turnedinside out and dried very slowly to prevent them from shrinking, andworked soft with a stone skin-dressing tool or the teeth. The nativesprefer to dry them in the sun. When the black epidermis wears off thisleather is no longer waterproof, so that the women are always on thewatch for white spots, which are mended with water-tight patches assoon as possible.  [Illustration: FIG. 82.--Sketch of “ice-creepers” on boot sole]In the early spring, before it thaws enough to render waterproof bootsnecessary, the surface of the snow becomes very smooth and slippery.To enable themselves to walk on this surface without falling, thenatives make a kind of “creeper” out of strips of sealskin. These aredoubled lengthwise, and generally bent into a half-moon or horseshoeshape, with the folded edges on the outside of the curve, sewed on thetoe and heel of the sealskin sole, as represented in Fig. 82.PARTS OF DRESS._Belts (tapsĭ)._--The belt which is used to hold up the pantaloons orbreeches is simply a stout strip of skin tied round the waist. Thegirdle, which is always worn outside of the frock, except when theweather is warm or the wearer heated by exercise, is very often asimilar strap of deerskin, or perhaps wolfskin. Often, however, andespecially for full dress, the men wear a handsome belt woven fromfeathers, and the women one made of wolverines’ toes. There are in thecollection two the former and one of the latter.  [Illustration: FIG. 83.--Man’s belt woven of feathers. The lower cut  shows detail of pattern. 1/4]No. 89544 [1419] (Fig. 83_a_) has been chosen as the type of a man’sbelt. It is 35 inches long and 1 inch broad, and made of the shafts offeathers woven into an elegant pattern, bordered on the edges withdeerskin, and terminating in a leather loop at one end and a braidedstring at the other. The loop is a flat piece of skin of the beardedseal, in which is cut a large oblong eye. The weaving begins at thesquare end of the loop. The warp consists of nine long strands sewedthrough the inner face of the leather so as to come out on the hinderedge. The middle strand is of stout sinew braid, ending in a knot onthe inner side of the leather. The four on each side are of finecotton twine or stout thread, each two being one continuous threadpassing through the leather and out again. The woof is the shafts ofsmall feathers regularly woven, the first strand woven over and under,ending over the warp, the next under and over, ending under the warp,and so on alternately, each strand extending about one-fourth inchbeyond the outer warp-strand on each side. This makes the patternshown in Fig. 83_b_, a long stitch on each side, three very short oneson each side of the middle, and a slightly longer one in the middle.The strips of feathers forming the woof are not joined together, butone strip is woven in as far as it will go, ending always on the innerside of the belt, a new strip beginning where the other ends. Theshafts of black feathers, with a few of the barbs attached, are woveninto the woof at tolerably regular intervals. Each black strand startsunder the first strand of the warp, making the outer and inner of thethree short stitches on each side black. This produces a checkeredpattern along the middle of the belt (see enlarged section, Fig.83_b_). The woof strands are driven home tightly and their ends aresecured on each side by a double thread of cotton sewed into thecorner of the leather loop. One thread runs along the outside of thebelt and the other along the inside, passing between the ends of thefeathers about every ten feathers and making a turn round the outerthread, as in Fig. 84. The edges of the belt are trimmed off even andbound with a narrow strip of deerskin with the flesh side out andpainted red. The binding of the upper edge makes an irregular looselining on the inside of the belt. Across the end of the belt is sewedon each side a narrow strip of sealskin, and the ends of the warp aregathered into a three-ply braid 16 inches long, which is used tofasten the belt by drawing it through the loop and knotting it. Anancient bone spearhead is attached to the belt as an amulet by a stoutstrap.  [Illustration: FIG. 84.--Diagram showing method of fastening the  ends of feathers in belt.]No. 89543 [1420] is a similar belt worn in precisely the same way, butwith the black feathers introduced in a different pattern. The weavingis done by hand with the help of some little tools, to be describedunder implements for making and working fiber. Belts of this styleappear to be peculiar to the Point Barrow region. Indeed, girdles ofany kind are seldom worn over the jacket by the men in the easternregions.  [Illustration: FIG. 85.--Woman’s belt of wolverine toes. 3/8]The women never wear anything except a simple strip of skin or thewolverine belt mentioned above. No. 89542 [1421], Fig. 85, is one ofthese. It is made of nine strips of dark brown skin from round thefoot of the wolverine, sewed together end to end. Each strip, exceptthe one at the end, has a claw at the lower corner (on some of thestrips the bit of skin bearing the claws is pieced in) so that thereare eight nearly equidistant claws making a fringe round the loweredge of the belt. There is a hole at each end into which ishalf-hitched the end of a narrow strip of deerskin about 8 incheslong. These strings serve to tie the girdle. This belt is 33 incheslong and 1½ inches wide, and has been worn so long that the inside isvery dirty. Such belts are very valuable and highly prized, and areworn exclusively by the women.  [Illustration: FIG. 86.--Belt-fastener.]Fig. 86, No. 89718 [1055], is an object which is quite uncommon andseldom if ever now seen in use. It is of walrus ivory, very old andyellow. It served as a belt-fastener (tápsĭgɐ). I have seen a brassclock wheel used on a girl’s belt for the same purpose. This specimenis very old, neatly made, and polished smooth, probably from long use._Ornaments._--In addition to the trimmings above described there arecertain ornamental appendages which belong to the dress, but can notbe considered as essential parts of any garments, like the trimmings.For instance, nearly every male in the two villages wears danglingfrom his back between the shoulders an ermine skin either brown orwhite, or an eagle’s feather, which is transferred to the new garmentwhen the old one is worn out. This is perhaps an amulet as well as anornament, as Dr. Simpson states.[N237] An eagle’s feather is oftenworn on the outside of the hood, pendant from the crown of the head.Attached to the belt are various amulets (to be described under thehead of “Religion”) and at the back always the tail of an animal,usually a wolverine’s. Very seldom a wolf’s tail is worn, but nearlyall, even the boys, have wolverine tails, which are always saved forthis purpose and used for no other. This habit among the Eskimo ofwestern America of wearing a tail at the girdle has been noticed bymany travelers, and prevails at least as far as the Anderson River,since Petitot,[N238] in describing the dress of the Anderson River“chief,” says: “par derrière il portait aux reins une queue épaisse etondoyante de renard noir.” According to him[N239] it is the _women_ ofthat region, who wear, “à titre de talismans, des defroques empailléesde corbeau, de faucon, ou d’hermine.” The custom of wearing an ermineskin on the jacket was observed by Dr. Armstrong of the _Investigator_at Cape Bathurst.[N240]    [Footnote N237: Op. cit., p. 243.]    [Footnote N238: Monographie, etc., p. xiv.]    [Footnote N239: Ibid.]    [Footnote N240: Personal Narrative, p. 176.]PERSONAL ADORNMENT.SKIN ORNAMENTATION._Tattooing._--The custom of tattooing is almost universal among thewomen, but the marks are confined almost exclusively to the chin andform a very simple pattern. This consists of one, three, five, orperhaps as many as seven vertical lines from the under lip to the tipof the chin, slightly radiating when there are more than one. Whenthere is a single line, which is rather rare, it is generally broad,and the middle line is sometimes broader than the others. The women asa rule are not tattooed until they reach a marriageable age, thoughthere were a few little girls in the two villages who had a singleline on the chin. I remember seeing but one married woman in eithervillage who was not tattooed, and she had come from a distantsettlement, from Point Hope, as well as we could understand.Tattooing on a man is a mark of distinction. Those men who are, orhave been, captains of whaling umiaks that have taken whales havemarks to indicate this tattooed somewhere on their persons, sometimesforming a definite tally. For instance, Añoru had a broad band acrosseach cheek from the corners of the mouth (Fig. 87, from a sketch bythe writer), made up of many indistinct lines, which was said toindicate “many whales.” Amaiyuna had the “flukes” of seven whales in aline across his chest, and Mû´ñialu had a couple of small marks on oneforearm. Niăksára, the wife of Añoru, also had a little mark tattooedin each corner of her mouth, which she said were “whale marks,”indicating that she was the wife of a successful whaleman. Such marks,according to Petitot (Monographie, etc., p. xv) are a part of theusual pattern in the Mackenzie district--“deux traits aux commissuresde la bouche.” One or two men at Nuwŭk had each a narrow line acrossthe face, over the bridge of the nose, which were probably also “whalemarks,” though we never could get a definite answer concerningthem.[N241]    [Footnote N241: Compare the custom observed by H.M.S.    _Investigator_, at Cape Bathurst, where, according to McClure    (Discovery of the Northwest Passage, p. 93), a successful    harpooner has a blue line drawn across his face over the bridge of    the nose; or, according to Armstrong (Personal Narrative, p. 176),    he has a line tattooed from the inner angle of the eye across the    cheek, a new one being added for every whale he strikes. Petitot,    however (Monographie, etc., p. xxv), says that in this region    whales are “scored” by tattooing crosses on the shoulder, and that    a murderer is marked across the nose with a couple of horizontal    lines. It is interesting to note in this connection that one of    the “striped” men at Nuwŭk told us that he had killed a man.    According to Holm, at Angmagsalik (east Greenland), “Mændene ere    kun undtagelsvis tatoverede og da kun med enkelte mindre Streger    paa Arme og Haandled, for at kunne harpunere godt” (Geogr. Tids.,    vol. 8, p. 88). Compare also Hooper, Tents, etc., p. 37, “Men only    make a permanent mark on the face for an act of prowess, such as    killing a bear, capturing a whale, etc.;” and Parry, 2d Voyage,    p. 449, where some of the men at Iglulik are said to be tattooed    on the back of the hand, as a souvenir of some distant or deceased    person.]  [Illustration: FIG. 87.--Man with tattooed cheeks.]The tattooing is done with a needle and thread, smeared with soot orgunpowder, giving a peculiar pitted appearance to the lines. It israther a painful operation, producing considerable inflammation andswelling, which lasts several days. The practice of tattooing thewomen is almost universal among the Eskimo, from Greenland to Kadiak,including the Eskimo of Siberia, the only exception being the nativesof Smith Sound, though the custom is falling into disuse among theEskimo who have much intercourse with the whites.[N242]    [Footnote N242: Bessels, Naturalist, vol. 18, p. 875 (Smith    Sound); Egede, p. 132, and Crantz, vol. 1, p. 138, already given    up by the Christian Greenlanders (Greenland); Holm. Geogr. Tids.,    vol. 8, p. 88, still practiced regularly in east Greenland; Parry,    1st Voyage, p. 282 (Baffin Land); 2d Voyage, p. 498 (Iglulik);    Kumlien, Contrib., p. 26 (Cumberland Gulf, aged women chiefly);    Boas, “Central Eskimo,” p. 561; Chappell, “Hudson Bay,” p. 60    (Hudson Strait); Back, Journey, etc., p. 289 (Great Fish River);    Franklin, 1st Exped., vol. 2, p. 183 (Coppermine River); 2d    Exped., p. 126 (Point Sabine); Petitot, Monographie, etc., p. xv    (Mackenzie district); Dall, “Alaska,” pp. 140, 381 (Norton Sound,    Diomede Islands, and Plover Bay); Petroff, Report, etc., p. 139    (Kadiak); Lisiansky, Voyage, p. 195 (Kadiak in 1805, “the fair sex    were also fond of tattooing the chin, breasts, and back, but this    again is much out of fashion”); Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2, pp.    99, 100, 251, and 252, with figures (Siberia and St. Lawrence    Island); Krause brothers, Geographische Blätter, vol. 5, pp. 4,    5 (East Cape to Plover Bay); Hooper, Tents, etc., p. 37, “Women    were tattooed on the chin in diverging lines” (Plover Bay); Rosse,    Cruise of the _Corwin_, p. 35, fig. on p. 36 (St. Lawrence    Island).    Frobisher’s account, being the earliest on record, is worth    quoting: “* * * The women are marked on the face with blewe    streekes downe the cheekes and round about the eies” (p. 621).    * * * “Also, some of their women race their faces proportionally,    as chinne, cheekes, and forehead, and the wristes of their hands,    whereupon they lay a colour, which continueth dark azurine”    (p. 627). Hakluyt’s Voyages, etc., 1589.]The simple pattern of straight, slightly diverging lines on the chinseems to prevail from the Mackenzie district to Kadiak, and similarchin lines appear always to form part of the more elaborate patterns,sometimes extending to the arms and other parts of the body, infashion among the eastern Eskimo[N243] and those of Siberia, St.Lawrence Island, and the Diomedes.    [Footnote N243: Holm (East Greenland) says: “et Paar korte Streger    paa Hagen” (Geogr. Tids. vol. 8, p. 88).]  [Illustration: FIG. 88.--Woman with ordinary tattooing.]Fig. 88, from a sketch made on the spot by the writer, shows the PointBarrow pattern._Painting._--On great occasions, such as dances, etc., or when goingwhaling, the face is marked with a broad streak of black lead, put onwith the finger, and usually running obliquely across the nose or onecheek.[N244] Children, when dressed up in new clothes, are alsofrequently marked in this way. This may be compared with the ancientcustom among the people of Kadiak of painting their faces “beforefestivities or games and before any important undertaking, such as thecrossing of a wide strait or arm of the sea, the sea-otter chase,etc.”[N245]    [Footnote N244: Compare Kotzebue’s Voy., vol. 3, p. 296, where    Chamisso describes the natives of St. Lawrence Bay, Siberia, as    having large quantities of fine graphite, with which they painted    their faces.]    [Footnote N245: Petroff Report, etc., p. 139.]HEAD ORNAMENTS._Method of wearing the hair._--The men and boys wear their hair combeddown straight over the forehead and cut off square across in front,but hanging in rather long locks on the sides, so as to cover theears. There is always a small circular tonsure on the crown of thehead, and a strip is generally clipped down to the nape of the neck.(See Fig. 89, from a sketch from life by the writer.) The nativesbelieve that this clipping of the back of the head prevents snowblindness in the spring. The people of the Mackenzie district have adifferent theory. “La large tonsure que portent nos Tchiglit a pourbut, m’ont-ils dit, de permettre au soleil de rechauffer leur cerveauet de transmettre par ce moyen sa bienfaisante chaleur à leur cœurpour les faire vivre.”[N246] Some of the Nunatañmiun and one man fromKilauwĭtaiwĭñ that we saw wore their front hair long, parted in themiddle, and confined by a narrow fillet of leather round the brow. Thehair on the tonsure is not always kept clipped very close, butsometimes allowed to grow as much as an inch long, which probably ledHooper to believe that the tonsure was not common at PointBarrow.[N247] It is universal at the present day, as it was in Dr.Simpson’s time.[N248] The western Eskimo generally crop or shave thecrown of the head, while those of the east allow their hair to growpretty long, sometimes clipping it on the forehead. The practice ofclipping the crown appears to be general in the Mackenziedistrict,[N249] and was occasionally observed at Iglulik by Capt.Parry (2d Voy., p. 493). The natives of St. Lawrence Island and theSiberian coast carry this custom to an extreme, clipping the wholecrown, so as to leave only a fringe round the head.[N250] The womendress their hair in the fashion common to all the Eskimo except theGreenlanders and the people about the Mackenzie and Anderson Rivers,where the women bring the hair up from behind into a sort of hightop-knot, with the addition in the latter district of large bows orpigtails on the sides.[N251] The hair is parted in the middle from theforehead to the nape of the neck, and gathered into a club on eachside behind the ear. The club is either simply braided or withoutfurther dressing twisted and lengthened out with strips of leather,and wound spirally for its whole length with a long string of smallbeads of various colors, a large flat brass button being stuck intothe hair above each club. The wife of the captain of a whaling umiakwears a strip of wolfskin in place of the string of beads when theboat is “in commission” (as Capt. Herendeen observed).

The hair isnot arranged every day. Both sexes are rather tidy about arrangingtheir hair, but there is much difference in this between individuals.The marrow of the reindeer is sometimes used for pomatum. Baldness ineither sex is rare. I do not remember ever seeing a bald woman, andthere were only two bald men at the two villages. Neither of these menwas very old._Head-bands._--Some of the men and boys wear across the forehead astring of large blue glass beads, sometimes sewed on a strip ofdeerskin. Occasionally, also a fillet is worn made of the skin of thehead of a fox or a dog, with the nose coming in the middle of theforehead. Such head-dresses are by no means common and seem to behighly prized, as they were never offered for sale. MacFarlane (MS.)speaks of a similar head-dress worn at the Anderson River, “generallymade of the skin of the fore part of the head skins of wolves,wolverines, and marmots. Very often, however, a string of beads ismade use of instead.” Another style of head-dress is the badge of awhaleman, and is worn only when whaling (and, I believe, at theceremonies in the spring preparatory to the whaling). This seems to bevery highly prized, and is, perhaps, “looked upon with superstitiousregard.”[N252] None were ever offered for sale and we had only two orthree opportunities of seeing it. It consists of a broad fillet ofmountain-sheep skin, with pendants of flint, jasper, or crystal,rudely flaked into the shape of a whale (see under “Amulets,” wherespecimens are described and figured), one in the middle of the browand one over each ear. Some of them are also fringed with the incisorteeth of the mountain sheep attached by means of a small hole drilledthrough the end of the root, as on the dancing cap (see under “Gamesand Pastimes”). The captain and harpooner of a whaling crew which Isaw starting out in the spring of 1882 each wore one of these fillets.The harpooner’s had only the whale pendants, but the captain’s wasalso fringed with teeth. This ornament closely resembles the filletfringed with deer’s teeth, observed by Capt. Parry at Iglulik,[N253]which “was understood to be worn on the head by men, though we did notlearn on what occasions.”    [Footnote N252: See Dr. Simpson, op. cit., p. 243. Compare also    Brodbeck, “Nach Osten” (p. 23). Speaking of “ein Kopf- oder    Stirnband,” he says: “Vielleicht gilt es ihnen als eine Art von    Zauberschützmittel, denn es ist um kein Geld zu haben. Drängt man    sie, so sagen sie wohl, es sei nicht ihr eigen.”]    [Footnote N253: Second Voy., p. 498 and Fig. 7, pl. opposite    p. 548.]_Earrings (nógolu)._--Nearly all the women and girls perforate thelobes of the ears and wear earrings. The commonest pattern is a littlehook of ivory to which are attached pendants, short strings of beads,etc. Large, oblong, dark-blue beads and bugles are specially desiredfor this purpose. Cheap brass or “brummagem” earrings are sometimesworn nowadays. The fashion in earrings seems to have changed somewhatsince Dr. Simpson’s time, as I do not remember ever having seen thelong strings of beads hanging across the breast or looped up behind ashe describes them.[N254] At present, one earring is much morefrequently worn than a pair. There are in the collection two pairs ofthe ivory hooks for earrings, which, though made for sale, are of theordinary pattern. Of these No. 89387 [1340] (Fig. 90) will serve asthe type. They are of coarse, white walrus ivory.    [Footnote N254: Op. cit., p. 211.]No. 89386 [1340] is a similar pair of earrings, in which the hookprojects at right angles and terminates in a flat, round button. Bothof the specimens are of the usual pattern, but very roughly made. Thecustom of wearing earrings is very general among the Eskimo. I needonly refer to the descriptions of dress and ornaments already quoted.  [Illustration: FIG. 90.--Earrings.]_Labrets._--As has been stated by all travelers who have visited PointBarrow since the time of Elson, all the adult males wear the labretsor stud-shaped lip ornaments. The discussion of the origin and extentof this habit, or even a comparison of the forms of labrets in useamong the Eskimo, would lead me far beyond the scope of the presentwork.[N255] They are or have been worn by all the Eskimo of westernAmerica, including St. Lawrence Island and the Diomedes, from the mostsouthern point of their range to the Mackenzie and Anderson district,and were also worn by Aleuts in ancient times.[N256] East of theMackenzie district no traces of the habit are to be observed.Petitot[N257] says that Cape Bathurst is the most eastern point atwhich labrets are worn. The custom of wearing them at this place isperhaps recent, as Dr. Armstrong, of the _Investigator_, expresslystates that he saw none there in 1850. At Plover Bay, eastern Siberia,however, I noticed one or two men with a little cross or circletattooed under each corner of the mouth, just in the position of thelabret. This may be a reminiscence of an ancient habit of wearinglabrets, or may have been done in imitation of the people of theDiomedes and the American coast.    [Footnote N255: This subject has been thoroughly treated by Mr.    W. H. Dall in his admirable paper in the Report of the Bureau of    Ethnology, No. 3 for 1881-’82, pp. 67-203.]    [Footnote N256: See Dall, Contrib., etc., vol. 1, p. 87, and the    paper just referred to.]    [Footnote N257: Monographie, etc., p. xxvi.]At Point Barrow at the present day the lip is always pierced for twolabrets, one at each corner of the mouth, though one or both of themare frequently left out. They told us, however, that in ancient timesa single labret only was worn, for which the lip was pierced directlyin the middle. Certain old and large-sized labrets in the collectionare said to have been thus worn. The incisions for the labrets appearto be made about the age of puberty, though I knew one young man whohad been married for some months before he had the operationperformed. From the young man’s character, I fancy shyness ortimidity, as suggested by Dr. Simpson,[N258] had something to do withthe delay. Contrary to Dr. Simpson’s experience, I did not see asingle man above the age of 18 or 19 who did not wear the labrets. Itseems hardly probable that ability to take a seal entitles a boy towear labrets, as he suggests. We knew a number of boys who wereexcellent seal hunters and even able to manage a kaiak, but none hadtheir lips pierced under the age of 14 or 15, when they may besupposed to have reached manhood. The incisions are at first onlylarge enough to admit a flat-headed pin of walrus ivory, about thediameter of a crow quill, worn with the head resting against the gum.These are soon replaced by a slightly stouter pair, and these again bystouter ones, until the holes are stretched to a diameter of aboutone-half inch, when they are ready for the labrets.    [Footnote N258: Op. cit., p. 241.]We heard of no special ceremonies or festivals connected with themaking of these incisions, such as Dall observed at NortonSound,[N259] but in the one case where the operation was performed atthe village of Utkiavwĭñ during our stay, we learned that it was doneby a man outside of the family of the youth operated upon. We werealso informed that the incisions must be made with a little lancet ofslate. The employment of an implement of ancient form and obsoletematerial for this purpose indicates, as Dall says in the passagereferred to above, “some greater significance than mereornamentation.”    [Footnote N259: Alaska p. 141.]The collection contains two specimens of such lancets. No. 89721[1153] (figured in Rept. Point Barrow Expedition, Ethnology, Pl. V,Fig. 4) is the type. A little blade of soft gray slate is carefullyinclosed in a neat case of cottonwood. The blade is lanceolate, 1.3inches long, 0.6 broad, and 0.1 thick, with a short, broad tang. Thefaces are somewhat rough, and ground with a broad bevel to very sharpcutting edges. The case is made of two similar pieces of wood, flat onone side and rounded on the other, so that when put together they makea rounded body 3 inches long, slightly flattened, and tapering towardthe rounded ends, of which one is somewhat larger than the other.Round each end is a narrow, deep, transverse groove for a string tohold the two parts together. A shallow median groove connects thesecross grooves on one piece, which is hollowed out on the flat faceinto a rough cavity of a shape and size suitable to receive the blade,which is produced into a narrow, deep groove at the point, probably tokeep the point of the blade from being dulled by touching the wood.The other piece, which serves as a cover, has merely a rough, shallow,oval depression near the middle. The whole is evidently very old, andthe case is browned with age and dirt.  [Illustration: FIG. 91.--Plug for enlarging labret hole.]No. 89579 [1200] is a similar blade of reddish purple slate, mountedin a rough haft of bone. Fig. 91, No. 89715 [1211], is one of a pairof bone models, made for sale, of the ivory plugs used for enlargingthe holes for the labrets, corresponding in size to about the secondpair used. It is roughly whittled out of a coarse-grained compactbone, and closely resembles the plugs figured by Dall from NortonSound,[N260] but lacks the hole in the tip for the transverse woodenpeg, which is not used at Point Barrow. One youth was wearing thefinal size of plugs when we landed at the station. These were broughtto a point like the tip of a walrus tusk, and had exactly theappearance of the tusks of a young walrus when they first protrudebeyond the lip. The labrets worn at Point Barrow at the present dayare usually of two patterns. One is a large, flat, circular disk about1½ inches in diameter, with a flat stud on the back something likethat of a sleevebutton, and the other a thick cylindrical plug about 1inch long, and one-half inch in diameter, with the protruded endrounded and the other expanded into an oblong flange, presenting aslightly curved surface to the gum. These plug labrets are the commonfashion for everyday wear, and at the present day, as in Dr. Simpson’stime, are almost without exception made of stone, Granite or syenite,porphyry, white marble, and sometimes coal (rarely jade) are used forthis purpose.    [Footnote N260: Alaska, p. 140.]  [Illustration: FIG. 92.--Labret of beads and ivory.]One of the Nunatañmiun wore a glass cruet-stopper for a labret, andmany natives of Utkiavwĭñ took the glass stopples of Worcestershiresauce bottles, which were thrown away at the station, and insertedthem in the labret holes for everyday wear, sometimes grinding theround top into an oblong stud. There is one specimen of the pluglabret in the collection. Labrets of all kinds are very highly prized,and it was almost impossible to obtain them.[N261] Though werepeatedly asked for them and promised to pay a good price, genuinelabrets that had been worn or that were intended for actual use werevery rarely offered for sale, though at one time a large number ofroughly made models or imitations were brought in. The single specimenof the plug labret (tu´tɐ) is No. 89700 [1163] (figured in PointBarrow Report, Ethnology, Pl. V, Fig. 3). It is a cylindrical plug ofhard, bright green stone (jade or hypochlorite), 1.1 inches long and0.6 in diameter at the outer end, which is rounded off, taperingslightly inward and expanded at the base into an elliptical disk 1.2inches long and 0.9 broad, slightly concave on the surface which restsagainst the teeth and gum. The specimen is old and of a material veryunusual at Point Barrow. Fig. 92, No. 89719 [1166], from Nuwŭk, mayalso be called a plug labret, but is of a very unusual pattern, andsaid to be very old. It has an oblong stud of walrus ivory surmountedby a large, transparent, slightly greenish glass bead, on top of whichis a small, translucent, sky-blue bead. The beads are held on by ashort wooden peg, running through the perforations of the beads and ahole drilled through the ivory. There is a somewhat similar labret inthe Museum collection (No. 48202) from Cape Prince of Wales, also veryold. It is surmounted by a single oblong blue bead.    [Footnote N261: The men whom Thomas Simpson met at or near Barter    Island sold their labrets, but demanded a hatchet or a dagger for    a pair of them (Narrative, p. 119).]I saw but one other labret made of whole beads, and this had threegood sized oval blue beads, in a cluster, projecting from the hole. Itwas worn by a man from Nuwŭk. This may be compared with a specimenfrom the Mackenzie district, No. 7714, to which two similar beads areattached in the same way. The disk labret is the pattern worn onfull-dress occasions, seldom when working or hunting. One disk and oneplug labret are frequently worn. Disk labrets are made of stone,sometimes of syenite or porphyry, but the most fashionable kind ismade of white marble, and has half of a large, blue glass beadcemented on the center of the disk. These are as highly prized as theywere in Dr. Simpson’s time, and we consequently did not succeed inprocuring a specimen.I obtained one pair of syenite disk labrets, No. 56716 [197] (figuredin Point Barrow Rept., Ethnology, Pl. V, Fig. 2). Each is a flatcircular disk (1.7 and 1.6 inches in diameter, respectively) of rathercoarse-grained black and white syenite, ground very smooth, but notpolished. On the back of each is an elliptical stud, like that of asleeve-button, 1.2 and 1.1 inches long and 0.8 and 0.6 broad,respectively.  [Illustration: FIG. 93.--Blue and white labret from Anderson River.]Fig. 93, No. 2083, is one of the blue and white disks said to comefrom the Anderson River. This is introduced to represent those worn atPoint Barrow, which are of precisely the same pattern. The disk is ofwhite marble, 1½ inches in diameter, and in the center of it iscemented, apparently with oil dregs, half of a transparent blue glassbead, three-quarters of an inch in diameter, around the middle ofwhich is cut a shallow groove. Similar marble disks without the beadare sometimes worn. These blue and white labrets appear to be wornfrom Cape Bathurst to the Kaniag peninsula, including the DiomedeIslands (see figure on p. 140 of Dall’s Alaska). There are specimensin the Museum from the Anderson River and from the north shore ofNorton Sound and we saw them worn by the Nunatañmiun, as well as thenatives of Point Barrow and Wainwright Inlet. The beads, which arelarger than those sold by the American traders, were undoubtedlyobtained from Siberia, as Kotzebue, in 1816, found the people of thesound which bears his name wearing labrets “ornamented with blue glassbeads.”[N262] The high value set on these blue-bead labrets has beenmentioned by Franklin[N263] and T. Simpson,[N264] as well as by Dr.Simpson.[N265] The last named seems to be the first to recognize thatthe disks were made of marble. All previous writers speak of them asmade of walrus ivory.    [Footnote N262: Voyage, vol. 1, p. 210. Labrets of precisely the    same pattern as the one described are figured in the frontispiece    of this volume. (See also Choris, Voyage Pittoresque).]    [Footnote N263: 2d Exp., p. 118.]    [Footnote N264: Narrative, p. 119.]    [Footnote N265: Op. cit., p. 239.]There are still at Point Barrow a few labrets of a very ancientpattern, such as are said to have been worn in the middle of the lip.These are very rarely put on, but are often carried by the owners onthe belt as amulets. All that we saw were of light green translucentjade, highly polished. I obtained one specimen, No. 89705 [866](figured in Point Barrow Rept., Ethnology, Pl. V, Fig. 1), a thinoblong disk of light green, translucent, polished jade, 2.6 incheslong, 1.1 wide in the middle, and 0.8 wide at the ends, with the outerface slightly convex. On the back is an oblong stud with rounded ends,slightly curved to fit the gums.Labrets of this material and pattern do not seem to be commonanywhere. Beechey saw one in Kotzebue Sound 3 inches long and 1½wide,[N266] and there is a large and handsome one in the Museumbrought by Mr. Nelson from the lower Yukon. A similar one has recentlybeen received from Kotzebue Sound.    [Footnote N266: Voyage, p. 249.]  [Illustration: FIG. 94.--Oblong labret of bone.]Fig. 94, No. 89712 [1169], from Sidaru is a labret of similar shape,3 inches long and 1½ broad, but made of compact bone, rather neatlycarved and ground smooth. It shows some signs of having been worn.There are marks on the stud where it appears to have been rubbedagainst the teeth, and it is probably genuine. The purchase of thisspecimen apparently started the manufacture of bone labrets atUtkiavwĭñ, where no bone labrets, old or new, had previously beenseen. For several days after we bought the specimen from Sidaru thenatives continued to bring over bone labrets, but all so newly andclumsily made that we declined to purchase any more than fourspecimens. About the same time they began to make oblong labrets outof soapstone (a material which we never saw used for genuine labrets),like Fig. 95, No. 89707 [1215]. The purchase of three specimens ofthese started a wholesale manufacture of them, and we stoppedpurchasing.  [Illustration: FIG. 95. Oblong labret of soapstone.]The oblong labret appears to have been still in fashion as late as1826, for Elson saw many of the men at Point Barrow wearing oblonglabrets of bone (_cf._ No. 89712 [1169] and stone, 3 inches long and 1broad.[N267] Unfortunately, he does not specify whether they were wornin pairs or singly, and if singly, as would be natural from their sizeand shape, whether in the middle of the lip or at one side.    [Footnote N267: Beechey’s Voy., p. 308.]  [Illustration: FIG. 96.--Ancient labrets.]Nos. 89304 [1713], 89716 [1042], and 89717 [1031] (Fig. 96) are veryold labrets, which are interesting from their resemblance to theancient Aleutian single labrets found by Dall in the cave on AmaknakIsland.[N268] No. 89304 [1713] is an elliptical plug of bituminouscoal, with a projecting flange round the base, which is slightlyconcave to fit the curve of the jaw. This labret is very old and wassaid to have been found in one of the ruined houses in Utkiavwĭñ. Theother two labrets are of walrus ivory and of similar shape, but havethe flange only at the ends of the base. All of these three are large,the largest being 2.2 inches wide and 0.7 thick, and the smallest 1.3by 0.5, so that they required a much larger incision in the lip thanis at present made. In connection with what has been said of theancient habit of wearing labrets in the middle of the lip, it isinteresting to note that Nordenskiöld saw men at Port Clarence whohad, besides the ordinary labret holes, “a similar hole forward in thelip.”[N269] The various portraits of natives previously inserted showthe present manner of wearing the labrets at Point Barrow.    [Footnote N268: See Contrib., etc., vol. 1, p. 89, and the two    copper figures on the plate opposite.]    [Footnote N269: Vega, vol. 2, p. 233.]NECK ORNAMENTS.Most of the women and girls wear necklaces made of strings of beads,large or small, frequently strung together with much taste. Thetobacco pouch is often attached to this necklace.ORNAMENTS OF THE LIMBS._Bracelets._--The women all wear bracelets, which are sometimesstrings of beads, but more commonly circles of iron, brass, or copperwire, of which several are often worn on the same wrist, after thefashion of bangles. The men also sometimes wear bracelets. Theseconsist of circles of narrow thong, upon which are strung one or twolarge beads or a couple of Dentalium shells (pû´tû).[N270]    [Footnote N270: There is in the collection a bunch of five of    these shells (No. 89530 [1357], which are scarce and highly valued    as ornaments. Mr. R. E. C. Stearns, of the U. S. National Museum,    has identified the species as Dentalium Indianorum Cpr. (probably    = _D. pretiosum_, Sby.), called “alĭkotci´k” by the Indians of    northwest California, and “hiqua” (J. K. Lord) or “hya-qua”    (F. Whymper) by the Indians round Queen Charlotte Sound.]We brought home one pair of men’s bracelets (newly made), one of which(89388 [1355]) is figured in Point Barrow Rept. Ethnology, Pl. I,Fig. 4. They are made of strips of seal thong 0.2 inch broad, bentinto rings (9.4 and 8.6 inches in circumference, respectively), withthe ends slightly overlapping and sewed together. On each is strung acylindrical bead of soapstone about one-half inch long and of the samediameter. A single bracelet is generally worn._Finger-rings._--Both sexes now frequently wear brass finger-rings,called katû´kqlĕrûñ, from katû´kqlûñ, the middle finger, upon whichthe ring is always worn.MISCELLANEOUS ORNAMENTS.  [Illustration: FIG. 97.--Beads of amber.]_Beads._--In addition to the ornaments already described, the womenuse short strings of beads, buttons, etc., to ornament various partsof the dress, especially the outer side of the inner frock (i´lupa),and strings of beads are often attached to various objects, such aspipes, tobacco pouches, etc. One or two women were also observed towear large bunches of beads and buttons attached to the inner girdlein front so as to hang down between the legs inside of the pantaloons.A similar strange custom was observed by Beechey at Hotham Inlet,where a young woman wore a good-sized metal bell in the sameuncomfortable manner.[N271] These people appear to have attempted themanufacture of beads in former times, when they were not so easilyobtained as at present. There is in the collection a string of foursmall beads made from amber picked up on the beach (Fig. 97, No. 89700[1716]). They are of dark honey-colored transparent amber, aboutone-third inch long and one-half inch diameter at the base. Such beadsare very rare at the present day. The above specimens were the onlyones seen.    [Footnote N271: Voyage, p. 295.]TOILET ARTICLES.The only object in use among these people that can be considered atoilet article is the small hair comb (ĭ^{d}lai´utĭn), usually made ofwalrus ivory.The collection contains ten specimens, from which No. 56566_b_ [182](Fig. 98_a_) has been selected as the type. It is made of walrus ivory(from near the root of the tusk). When in use, it is held with the tipof the forefinger in the ring, the thumb and middle finger resting oneach side of the neck. This is perhaps the commonest form of the comb,though it is often made with two curved arms at the top instead of aring, as in Fig. 98_b_, No. 56569 [194], or sometimes with a plaintop, like No. 56572 [210] (Fig. 98_c_). Nine of the ten combs, allfrom Utkiavwĭñ, are of walrus ivory, but No. 89785 [1006], which wasthe property of Ilû´bwga, the Nunatañmiun, who spent the winter of1882-’83 at Utkiavwĭñ, is made of reindeer antler. This was probablymade in the interior, where antler is more plentiful than ivory. Allthese combs are made with great care and patience. The teeth areusually cut with a saw, but on one specimen the maker used the sharpedge of a piece of tin, as we had refused to loan him a fine saw. Thiskind of comb is very like that described by Parry from Iglulik.[N272]    [Footnote N272: 2nd Voyage, p. 194, Fig. 12, Pl. opp. p. 548.]  [Illustration: FIG. 98.--Hair combs.]IMPLEMENTS FOR GENERAL USE.TOOLS._Knives._--All the men are now supplied with excellent knives ofcivilized manufacture, mostly butcher knives or sheath knives ofvarious patterns, which they employ for numerous purposes, such asskinning and butchering game, cutting up food, and rough whittling.Fine whittling and carving is usually done with the “crooked knife,”to be described further on. In whittling the knife is grasped so thatthe blade projects on the ulnar side of the hand and is drawn towardthe workman. A pocketknife, of which they have many of variouspatterns, is used in the same way. I observed that the Asiatic Eskimoat Plover Bay held the knife in the same manner. Capt. Lyon, indescribing a man whittling at Winter island, says: “As is customarywith negroes, he cut toward the left hand and never used the thumb ofthe right, as we do, for a check to the knife.”[N273] This apparentlyrefers to a similar manner of holding the knife. Before theintroduction of iron, knives appear to have been always made of slate,worked by grinding. We obtained twenty-six more or less completeknives, most of which are genuine old implements, which have beenpreserved as heirlooms or amulets. These knives are either single ordouble edged, and the double-edged knives may be divided into fourclasses, according to their shape. The first class consists of rathersmall knives with the edges straight or only slightly curved, taperingto a sharp or truncated point, with the butt terminating in a shortbroad tang slightly narrower than the blade, which is inserted in theend of a straight wooden haft, at least as long as the blade. Thecommonest material is a hard, dark purple slate, though some are ofblack or dark gray slate. Of this class we have three complete knivesand five blades without the haft.    [Footnote N273: Journal, p. 92.]  [Illustration: FIG. 99.--Slate knives. 1/2]No. 89584 [1107] (figured in Point Barrow Rept., Ethnology, Pl. III,Fig. 3), will represent this class. It is a blade of dark purpleslate, ground smooth, 3.5 inches long, tapering from a width of 1.3inches at the butt, with curved edges to a sharp point, and beveled onboth faces from the middle line to the edges, and the flat tang isinserted into a cleft in the end of a straight haft of spruce. Theblade is secured by a whipping of about fifteen turns of sinew braidlodged in a broad shallow groove round the end of the haft. In a holein the other end of the haft is looped a short lanyard of seal thong.Fig. 99_a_, No. 89581 [1011], is a knife of the same class and aboutthe same size, having a haft 4 inches and a blade 3 inches long. Theblade is secured by two lashings, of which the first is a narrow stripof whalebone, and the other of sinew braid. The materials of blade andhaft are the same as before. No. 89585 [1710] (Fig. 99_b_), has ablade of dark gray slate, and the haft, which appears to be of cottonwood, is in two longitudinal sections. The lashing which holds thesetwo sections together is of braided sinew. Of the blades, the onlysharp-pointed one, No. 56684 [228] (Fig. 100), is like the blade of89584 [1107], but rather larger. The others all have rounded ortruncated points and are not over 3½ inches long, including the tang,but otherwise closely resemble the blades already described. They allshow signs of considerable age and several of them are nicked andgapped on the edge from use. Knives of this class are not like any inuse at the present day, and it was not possible to learn definitelywhether this shape served any special purpose. We were, however, givento understand that the sharp-pointed ones were sometimes, at least,used for stabbing. Perhaps they were used specially for cutting up thesmaller animals.  [Illustration: FIG. 100.--Slate knife-blade. 1/2]The second class, of which there are four specimens, is not unlike thefirst, but the blade is short and broad, with strongly curved edges,and always sharp pointed, while the haft is always much longer thanthe blade. Instead of being evenly beveled off on both faces from themiddle line to the edges, they are either slightly convex, worked downgradually to the edge, or flat with narrowly beveled edges. They areall small knives, the longest being 8.3 inches long, with the bladeprojecting 3.1 inches from the haft, and the shortest 4.9 inches, withthe blade projecting only 1.4 inches.  [Illustration: FIG. 101.--Slate knife. 1/2]Fig. 101, No. 89583 [1305], is a knife of this class, with the blade anearly equilateral triangle (1.4 inches long and 1.3 inches wide atthe base), with a flat wooden haft as wide as the blade and 3½ incheslong, cleft at the tip and lashed with thirteen or fourteen turns ofsinew braid. The holes near the butt of the haft were probably toreceive a lanyard. Fig. 102, No. 89591 [1016], is another form of thesame class. The blade is secured by a single rivet of wood.  [Illustration: FIG. 102.--Slate knife. 1/4]  [Illustration: FIG. 103.--Slate hunting-knife. 1/4]The third class consists of large knives, with long, broad, lanceolateblades, and short straight hafts. There is only one complete specimen,No. 89592 [1002], Fig. 103. This has a blade of soft, light greenishslate, 6 inches long and 2.6 inches broad, with the edges broadlybeveled on both faces. The haft of spruce is in two longitudinalsections, put together so as to inclose the short tang of the blade,and is secured by a tight whipping of eighteen turns of fine sealtwine, and painted with red ocher. This knife is new and was made forsale, but is undoubtedly a correct model of an ancient pattern, as No.56676 [204] (Fig. 104), which is certainly ancient, appears to be theblade of just such a knife. We were told that the latter was intendedfor cutting blubber. This perhaps means that it was a whaling knife.Mr. Nelson brought home a magnificent knife of precisely the samepattern, made of light green jade.  [Illustration: FIG. 104.--Blade of slate hunting-knife. 1/4]  [Illustration: FIG. 105.--Large slate knife. 1/4]The two knives, representing the fourth class, are both new and madefor sale, having blades of soft slate. As we obtained no genuineknives of this pattern, it is possible that they are merely commercialfabrications. The two knives are very nearly alike, but the larger,No. 89590 [984] (Fig. 105), is the more carefully made. The blade is oflight greenish gray slate, 6.2 inches long and 2 inches broad, and isstraight nearly to the tip, where it curves to a sharp point, making ablade like that of the Roman gladius. The haft is a piece sawed out ofthe beam of an antler, and has a cleft sawed in one end to receive theshort broad tang of the blade. The whipping is of sinew braid.  [Illustration: FIG. 106.--Large single-edged slate knife. 1/4]The single-edged knives were probably all meant specially for cuttingfood, and are all of the same general pattern, varying in size from ablade only 2½ inches long to one of 7 inches. The blade is generallymore strongly curved along the edge than on the back and is usuallysharp-pointed. It is fitted with a broad tang to a straight haft,usually shorter than the blade. There are in the collection fourcomplete knives and five unhafted blades. No. 89597 [1052] (Fig. 106)is a typical knife of this kind. The blade is of black slate, ratherrough, and is 5.6 inches long (including the tang). The tang, which isabout one-half inch long and the same breadth, is lashed _against_ oneend of the flat haft of bone which is cut away to receive it, withfive turns of stout seal thong. No. 89594 [1053] differs from thepreceding only in having the tang inserted in a cleft in the end ofthe haft, and No. 89589_a_ [1054] has the back more curved than theedge, the haft of antler and the lashing of whalebone. All three areof very rude workmanship. No. 89587 [1587], is a small knife with atruncated point and the tang imbedded without lashing in the end of aroughly made haft of bone.  [Illustration: FIG. 107.--Blades of knives.]Most of the blades are those of knives similar to the type, moresmoothly finished, but No. 56712 [226] (Fig. 107_a_) is noticeable forthe extreme “belly” of the edge and the smoothness with which thefaces are beveled from back to edge. Such knives approach the woman’sround knife (ulu, ulu´ra). No. 89601 [776] (Fig. 107_b_) is almostdouble-edged, the back being rounded off. Fig. 108, No. 89631 [1081],is a very remarkable form of slate knife, of which this was the onlyspecimen seen. In shape it somewhat resembles a hatchet, having abroad triangular blade with a strongly curved cutting edge, along theback of which is fitted a stout haft of bone 12½ inches long. Theblade is of soft, dark purple slate, ground smooth, and resembles themodern knives in having the sharp cutting edge beveled almost whollyon one face. The haft is the foreshaft of an old whale harpoon, and ismade of whale’s bone. The back of the blade is fitted into a deepnarrow saw cut, and held on by three very neat lashings of narrowstrips of whalebone, each of which passes through a hole drilledthrough the blade close to the haft and through a pair of verticalholes in the haft on each side of the blade. These holes convergetowards the back of the haft and are joined by a deep channel, so thatthe lashing is countersunk below the surface of the haft. Thisimplement was brought down from Nuwŭk and offered for sale as a knifeanciently used for cutting off the blubber of a whale. The purchasergot the impression that it was formerly attached to a long pole andused like a whale spade. On more careful examination after our returnit was discovered that the haft was really part of an old harpoon andthat the lashings and holes to receive them were evidently newer thanthe haft.  [Illustration: FIG. 108.--Peculiar slate knife. 1/4]It is possible that the blade may have been long ago fitted to thehaft and that the tool may have been used as described. That knives ofthis sort were occasionally used by the Eskimo is shown by a specimenin the Museum from Norton Sound. This is smaller than the onedescribed but has a slate blade of nearly the same shape and has ahaft, for hand use only, put on in the same way.With such knives as these the cut is made by _drawing_ the knifetoward the user instead of pushing it away, as in using the roundknife. We found no evidence that these Eskimo ever used knives ofivory (except for cutting snow) or ivory knives with bits of ironinlaid in the edge, such as have been observed among those of theEast.  [Illustration: FIG. 109--Knife with whalebone blade. 1/4]Fig. 109, No. 89477 [1422], is a very extraordinary implement, whichwas brought down from Point Barrow and which has evidently beenexposed alongside of some corpse at the cemetery. The blade is a long,flat, thin piece of whalebone wedged between the two psarts of thehaft, which has been sawed lengthwise for 6½ inches to receive it. Thehaft is a slender piece of antler. No other specimens of the kind wereseen, nor have similar implements, to my knowledge, been observedelsewhere. The natives insisted that it was genuine, and was formerlyused for cutting blubber.  [Illustration: FIG. 110.--Small iron knife.]I have introduced four figures of old iron or steel knives, of whichwe have six specimens, in order to show the way in which the nativesin early days, when iron was scarce, utilized old case-knives and bitsof tools, fitting them with hafts of their own make. All agree inhaving the edge beveled on the upper face only. All the knives whichthey obtain from the whites at the present day are worked over with afile so as to bring the bevel on one face only. Fig. 110, No. 89296[970], from Nuwŭk, has a blade of iron, and the flat haft is made oftwo longitudinal sections of reindeer antler, held together with fourlarge rivets nearly equidistant. The two which pass through the tangare of brass and the other two of iron. The blade is 3.6 inches long,the haft 4.1 long and 0.9 broad. Fig. 110, No. 89294 [901], fromUtkiavwĭñ, has a short, thick, and sharp-pointed blade, and is haftedin the same way with antler, one section of the haft being cut out toreceive the short, thick tang. The first two rivets are of iron, theother three of brass and not quite long enough to go wholly throughthe haft. The blade is barely 2 inches long. Fig. 111_a_, No. 89297[1125], from Nuwŭk, has a short blade, 2½ inches long, and the twosections of the haft are held together, not by rivets, but by a closespiral lasting of stout seal thong extending the whole length of thehaft. No. 89293 [1330], Fig. 111_b_, from Utkiavwĭñ, has a peculiarlyshaped blade, which is a bit of some steel tool imbedded in the end ofa straight bit of antler 4 inches long. One of these knives, notfigured, is evidently part of the blade of an old-fashioned curvedcase knife. It is stamped with the name “Wilson,” and underneath thisare three figures, of which only <> can be made out. This may be atable knife bought or stolen from the _Plover_ in 1852-’54.  [Illustration: FIG. 111.--Small iron knives. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 112.--Iron hunting knife. 1/2]There is in the collection one large double-edged knife (Fig. 112, No.89298 [1162]) of precisely the same form as the slate hunting knife(Fig. 103) and Mr. Nelson’s jade knife previously mentioned. The bladeis of thick sheet iron, which has in it a couple of rivet holes, andthe haft of reindeer antler in two sections, held together by a largecopper rivet at each end and a marline of sinew braid. Each edge has anarrow bevel on one face only, the two edges being beveled on oppositefaces. There are a small number of such knives still in use,especially as hunting knives (for cutting up walrus, one man said).They are considered to be better than modern knives for keeping offevil spirits at night. As is not unusual, the antiquity of the objecthas probably invested it with a certain amount of superstitiousregard. These knives are undoubtedly the same as the “double-edgedknives (pan´-na)” mentioned by Dr. Simpson (op. cit., p. 266) asbrought for sale by the Nunatañmiun, who obtained them from theSiberian natives, and which he believes to be carried as far as thestrait of Fury and Hecla. It would be interesting to decide whetherthe stone hunting knives were an original idea of the Eskimo, orwhether they were copies, in stone, of the first few iron knivesobtained from Siberia; but more material is needed before the mattercan be cleared up.The natives of Point Barrow, in ordinary conversation, call all knivessavĭk, which also means _iron_, and is identically the same as theword used in Greenland for the same objects. If, then, there was atime, as these people say, when their ancestors were totally ignorantof the use of iron--and the large number of stone implements stillfound among them is strongly corroborative of this--the use of thisname indicates that the first iron was obtained from the east, alongwith the soapstone lamps, instead of from Siberia. Had it first comefrom Siberia, as tobacco did, we should expect to find it, like thelatter, called by a Russian or Siberian name.Like all the Eskimo of North America from Cape Bathurst westward, thenatives of Point Barrow use for fine whittling and carving on wood,ivory, bone, etc., “crooked knives,” consisting of a small blade, seton the under side of the end of a long curved haft, so that the edge,which is beveled only on the upper face, projects about as much asthat of a spokeshave. The curve of blade and haft is such that whenthe under surface of the blade rests against the surface to be cut theend of the haft points up at an angle of about 45°. This knife differsessentially from the crooked carving knife so generally used by theIndians of North America. As a rule the latter has only the blade(which is often double edged) curved and stuck into the end of astraight haft. These knives are at the present time made of iron orsteel and are of two sizes, a large knife, mĭ´dlĭñ, with a haft 10 to20 inches long, intended for working on wood, and a small one,savigro´n (lit. “an instrument for shaving”), with a haft 6 or 7inches long and intended specially for cutting bone and ivory. Bothsizes are handled in the same way. The knife is held close to theblade between the index and second fingers of the right hand with thethumb over the edge, which is toward the workman. The workman drawsthe knife toward him, using his thumb as a check to gauge the depth ofthe cut. The natives use these knives with very great skill, takingoff long and very even shavings and producing very neatworkmanship.[N274]    [Footnote N274: Compare this with what Capt. Parry says of the    workmanship of the people of Iglulik (2d Voy., p. 336). The almost    exclusive use of the double-edged pan´na is the reason their work    is so “remarkably coarse and clumsy.”]There are in the collection four large knives and thirteen small ones.No. 89278 [787] (Fig. 113) will serve as the type of the large knives.The haft is a piece of reindeer antler, flat on one face and roundedon the other, and the curve is toward the rounded face. The flat faceis hollowed out by cutting away the cancellated tissue from the bendto the tip, and the lower edge is sloped off so that the end of thehaft is flat and narrow, with a slight twist. The blade is riveted tothe flat face of the haft with three iron rivets, and is a piece of asaw countersunk flush with the surface of the haft, so that it followsits curvature. The cutting edge is beveled only on the upper face. Thelower edge of the haft, from the blade to the place where it begins tonarrow, is pierced with eleven equidistant holes, through which islaced a piece of sealskin thong, the two parts crossing like ashoe-lacing, to prevent the hand from slipping. The ornamental patternon the upper face of the haft is incised and was originally coloredwith red ocher, but is now filled with dirt.  [Illustration: FIG. 113.--Large crooked knife. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 114.--Large crooked knife, with sheath. 1/3]Fig. 114, No. 89780 [1004_d_], is a very long hafted knife (the haftis 12.3 inches long), but otherwise resembles the type, though not soelaborately ornamented. The blade is also a bit of a saw. It isprovided with a sheath 3¼ inches long, made of black sealskin with theblack side out, doubled over at one side, and sewed “over and over”down the other side and round one end. To the open end is sewed a bitof thong with a slit in the end of it, into which one end of a lanyardof seal twine 15 inches long is fastened with a becket-hitch. When thesheath is fitted over the blade the lanyard is passed through a holein the haft and made fast by two or three turns around it. Suchsheaths are often used by careful workmen. This particular knife wasthe property of the “inlander” Ilû´bwgɐ, previously mentioned. No.89283 [967], from Nuwŭk, is interesting as being the only left-handedtool we obtained. The fourth knife has a blade with a cutting edge of3½ inches, while that of each of the others is 3 inches.The small knife differs little from the mĭ´dlĭñ except in having thehaft very much shorter and not tapered off at the tip. Fig. 115_a_,No. 56552 [145], from Utkiavwĭñ, shows a common form of this kind ofknife, though the blade usually has a sharp point like those of thelarge knives, projecting beyond the end of the haft. This knife has ablade of iron riveted on with two iron rivets to a haft of reindeerantler. The edges of the haft close to the blade are roughened withcrosscuts to prevent slipping.The blades of the small knives are frequently inserted into a cleft inthe edge of the haft, as in Fig. 115_b_, 89632 [827], and 89277[1172]. The blade, in such cases, is secured by wedging it tightly,with sometimes the addition of a lashing of thong through a hole inthe haft and round the heel of the blade. The blade is usually ofsteel, in most cases a bit of a saw and the haft of reindeer antler,generally plain, unless the circular hollows, such as are to be seenon No. 89277 [1172], which are very common, are intended for ornament.Fig. 116, No. 89275 [1183], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a rather peculiarknife. The haft, which is the only one seen of walrus ivory, is nearlystraight, and the unusually long point of the blade is strongly bentup. The rivets are of copper. This knife, the history of which we didnot obtain, was very likely meant both for wood and ivory. It is oldand rusty and has been long in use.  [Illustration: FIG. 115.--Small crooked knives. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 116.--Crooked knife. 1/3]All of the crooked knives in the collection are genuine implementswhich have been actually in use, and do not differ in type from thecrooked knives in the Museum from the Mackenzie district, KotzebueSound, and other parts of Alaska. Similar knives appear to be usedamong the Siberian Eskimo and the Chukches, who have adopted theirhabits. Hooper (Tents, etc., p. 175), mentions “a small knife with abent blade and a handle, generally made of the tip of a deer’s horn,”as one in general use at Plover Bay, and handled in the same skillfulway as at Point Barrow.[N275] Among the Eskimo of the central regionthey are almost entirely unknown. The only mention I have seen of suchtools is in Parry’s Second Voyage (p. 504), where he speaks of seeingat Iglulik “several open knives with crooked wooden handles,” which hethinks “must have been obtained by communication alongshore withHudson Bay.” I can find no specimen, figure, or description of thesa´nat (“tool”), _the_ tool par excellence of the Greenlanders, exceptthe following definition in Kleinschmidt’s “Grønlandsk Ordbog”:“2. Specially a narrow, long-hafted knife, which is sharpened on oneside and slightly curved at the tip (and which is a Greenlander’schief tool).” This seems to indicate that this knife, so common in theWest, is equally common in Greenland.[N276]    [Footnote N275: Lisiansky also mentions “a small crooked knife”    (Voyage, p. 181), as one of the tools used in Kadiak in 1805.]    [Footnote N276: A specimen has lately been received at the    National Museum. It is remarkably like the Indian knife in    pattern.]  [Illustration: FIG. 117.--Crooked knives, flint bladed. 4/9 1/3]Whether these people used crooked knives before the introduction ofiron is by no means certain, though not improbable. Fig. 117_a_, No.89633 [1196], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a knife made by imbedding a flake ofgray flint in the lower edge of a haft of reindeer antler, of theproper shape and curvature for a mĭdlĭñ handle. The haft is soiled andundoubtedly old, while the flaked surfaces of the flint do not seemfresh, and the edge shows slight nicks, as if it had been used. Hadthis knife been followed by others equally genuine looking, I shouldhave no hesitation in pronouncing it a prehistoric knife, and theancestor of the present steel one. The fact, however, that itspurchase gave rise to the manufacture of a host of flint knives allobviously new and more and more clumsily made, until we refused to buyany more, leads me to suspect that it was fabricated with very greatcare from old material, and skillfully soiled by the maker.Ten of these knives of flint were purchased within a fortnight beforewe detected the deceit. Fig. 117_b_, No. 89636 [1212] is one of thebest of these counterfeits, made by wedging a freshly flaked flintblade into the haft of an old savigrón, which has been somewhattrimmed to receive the blade and soiled and charred to make it lookold. Other more carelessly made ones had clumsily carved handles ofwhale’s bone, with roughly flaked flints stuck into them and glued inwith oil dregs. All of these came from Utkiavwĭñ. Another suspiciouscircumstance is that a few days previously two slate-bladed crookedknives had been brought down from Nuwŭk and accepted without questionas ancient. On examining the specimens since our return, I find thatwhile the hafts are certainly old, the blades, which are of soft slateeasily worked, are as certainly new. Fig. 118_a_, 118_b_, representthese two knives (89580 [1062], 89586 [1061]), which have the bladeslashed on with deer sinew. It is worthy of note in this connectionthat there are no stone knives of this pattern in the museum from anyother locality.  [Illustration: FIG. 118.--Slate-bladed crooked knives. 1/2]The women employ for all purposes for which a knife or scissors couldbe used a semicircular knife of the same general type as thosedescribed by every writer from the days of Egede, who has had to dealwith the Eskimo. The knives at the present day are made of steel,usually, and perhaps always, of a piece of a saw blade, which gives asheet of steel of the proper breadth and thickness, and aremanufactured by the natives themselves. Dr. Simpson says[N277] that inhis time they were brought from Kotzebue Sound by the Nunatañmiun, whoobtained them from the Siberian Eskimo. There are in the collectionthree of these steel knives, all of the small size generally calledulúrɐ (“little úlu”). No. 56546 [14] has been picked out fordescription (Fig. 119). The blade is wedged into a handle of walrusivory. The ornamentation on the handle is of incised lines and dotsblackened. The cutting edge of the blade is beveled on one face only.This knife represents the general shape of knives of this sort, but israther smaller than most of them. I have seen some knives with bladesfully 5 or 6 inches long and deep in proportion. The handle is almostalways of walrus ivory and of the shape figured. I do not rememberever seeing an úlu blade secured otherwise than by fitting it tightlyinto a narrow slit in the handle, except in one case, when the handlewas part of the original handle of the saw of which the knife wasmade, left still riveted on.    [Footnote N277: Op. cit., p. 266.]  [Illustration: FIG. 119.--Woman’s knife, steel blade. 1/3]It is not necessary to specify the various purposes for which theseknives are used. Whenever a woman wishes to cut anything, from herfood to a thread in her sewing, she uses an úlu in preference toanything else. The knife is handled precisely as described among theeastern Eskimo, making the cut by pushing instead of drawing,[N278]thus differing from the long-handled round knife mentioned above.Knives of this pattern are very generally used among the westernEskimo, but in the east the blade is always separated from the handleby a short shank, as in our mincing knives.    [Footnote N278: See for example, Kumlien, op. cit., p. 26.]  [Illustration: FIG. 120.--Woman’s knife, slate blade. 1/3]The natives of Point Barrow used round knives long before theintroduction of iron. There are in the collection twenty-three more orless complete round knives of stone, most of which are genuineimplements that have been used. Of these a few, which are perhaps themore recent ones, have blades not unlike the modern steel knife. Forinstance, No. 89680 [1106] Fig. 120, has a blade of hard gray micaslate of almost precisely the modern shape, but both faces aregradually worked down to the cutting edge without a bevel on either.The handle is very large and stout and made of coarse whale’s bone.This knife was said to have come from the ruined village at Pernyɐ.Fig. 121, No. 89679 [971], from Nuwŭk, was made for sale, but isperhaps a model of a form sometimes used. The shape of the blade isquite different from those now in use, in having the cutting edgeturned so strongly to the front. The handle is of oak and the blade ofrather hard, dark purple slate. Fig. 122, 89689 [985], also fromNuwŭk, and made for the market, is introduced to show a method ofhafting which may have been formerly employed. The haft is of reindeerantler in two longitudinal sections, between which the blade iswedged. These two sections are held together by lashings of sinew ateach end, passing through holes in each piece and round the ends.These lashings being put on wet, have shrunk so that the blade is verytightly clasped between the two parts of the handle. The commoner formof these stone knives, however, has the back of the blade much longer,so that the sides are straight instead of oblique and usually roundoff gradually at the ends of the cutting edge without being producedinto a point at either end. No. 89682 [958] is a form intermediatebetween this and the modern shape, having a blade with a long back,but produced into a sharp point at one end. The handle is of reindeerantler and the blade rather soft black slate. This specimen is a verycleverly counterfeited antique.  [Illustration: FIG. 121.--Woman’s knife, slate blade. 1/3]  [Illustration: FIG. 122.--Woman’s knife, slate blade. 1/3]  [Illustration: FIG. 123.--Woman’s knife, slate blade. 1/3]No. 89636 [1122], Fig. 123, approaches yet nearer the ancient shape,but still has one end slightly produced. The handle is also ofreindeer antler, which seems to have been very commonly used with theslate blades. The lashing round the blade close to the handle is ofseal thong, with the end wound spirally round all the parts on bothsides and neatly tucked in. It seems to serve no purpose beyondenlarging the handle so as to make it fit the hand better. Onebeautiful blade of light olive green, clouded jade, No. 89675 [1170],belonged to a knife of this pattern. The older pattern is representedby No. 89676 [1586], a small knife blade from Ukiavwĭñ, which has beenkept as an amulet. No. 56660 [129], is a blade of the same type, butelongated, being 7½ inches long and 2 broad. This is a very beautifulimplement of pale olive jade, ground smooth. The bevel along the backof each of these blades indicates that they were to be fitted into anarrow slit in a long haft, like that of No. 89684 [886], Fig. 124,from Nuwŭk. Though both blade and handle of this specimen are veryold, and have been put together in their present shape for a longtime, the handle, which is of whale’s bone, evidently belonged to alonger blade, which fitted in the cleft without the need of anylashing. Fig. 125, No. 89693 [874], shows a form of handle evidentlyof very great antiquity, as the specimen shows signs of great age. Itwas purchased from a native of Utkiavwĭñ. It is made of a single pieceof coarse whale’s bone. It was intended for a blade at least 7 incheslong.  [Illustration: FIG. 124.--Woman’s ancient slate-bladed knife. 1/3]  [Illustration: FIG. 125.--Ancient bone handle for woman’s knife.  1/3]  [Illustration: FIG. 126.--Large knife of slate. 1/3]Fig. 126, No. 56672 [191], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a very crude, largeknife, intended for use without a handle. It is of rough, hard, darkpurplish slate. The upper three-quarters of both faces are almostuntouched cleavage surfaces, but the lower quarter is pretty smoothlyground down to a semicircular cutting edge, which is somewhat nickedfrom use. The angular grooves on the two faces were evidently begunwith the intention of cutting the knife in two. We were told that thislarge knife was specially for cutting blubber. It is a genuineantique.While ground slate is a quite common material for round knives, flintappears to have been rarely used. We obtained only three of thismaterial. No. 89690 [1311] is a flint knife hafted with a rough,irregular lump of coarse whale’s bone. The blade is a rather thin“spall” of light gray flint, flaked round the edges into the shape ofa modern ulúrɐ blade, with a very strongly curved cutting edge. Thoughthe handle is new, the flaking of the blade does not seem fresh, sothat it is possibly a genuine old blade fitted with a new haft for themarket. A similar flint blade, more neatly flaked, was brought fromKotzebue Sound by Lieut. Stoney, U.S. Navy, in 1884. The other twoflint knives are interesting from being made for use without handles.  [Illustration: FIG. 127.--Woman’s knife of flaked flint. 1/3]No. 89691 [1360], Fig. 127, from Sidaru, is an oblong, wedge-shapedspall of gray flint, of which the back still preserves the naturalsurface of the pebble. It is slightly shaped by coarse flaking alongthe back and one end, and the edge is finely flaked into a curvedoutline rounding up at the ends. The specimen is old and dirty, andwas probably preserved as a sort of heirloom or amulet. No. 89692[1178] is a similar spall from a round pebble. Such knives as theseare evidently the first steps in the development of the round knife.The shape of the spalls, produced by breaking a round or oval pebbleof flint, would naturally suggest using them as knives, and the nextstep would be to improve the edge by flaking. The greater adaptabilityof slate, from its softness and easy cleavage, for making such kniveswould soon be recognized, and we should expect to find, as we do,knives like No. 56672 [191]. The next step would naturally be toprovide such a knife with a haft at the point where the stone wasgrasped by the hand, while reducing this haft so as to leave only justenough for the grasp and cutting away the superfluous corners of theblade would give us the modern form of the blade. Round knives ofslate are not peculiar to Point Barrow, but have been collected inmany other places in northwestern America.[N279]    [Footnote N279: See, especially, Dall, Contrib., vol. 1, pp. 59    and 79, for figures of such knives from the caves of Unalashka.]The relationship between these knives and the semilunar slate bladesfound in the North Atlantic States has already been ably discussed byDr. Charles Rau.[N280] It must, however, be borne in mind that whilethese are sufficiently “fish-cutters” to warrant their admission intoa book on fishing, the cutting of fish is but a small part of the workthey do. The name “fish-cutter,” as applied to these knives, would beno more distinctive than the name “tobacco-cutter” for a Yankee’sjackknife.[N281]    [Footnote N280: Prehistoric Fishing, pp. 183-188.]    [Footnote N281: It is but just to Dr. Rau to say that he    recognized the fact that these implements are not exclusively    fish-cutters, and applies this name only to indicate that he has    treated of them simply in reference to their use as such. The    idea, however, that these, being slightly different in shape from    the Greenland _olu_ or ulu, are merely fish knives, has gained a    certain currency among anthropologists which it is desirable to    counteract.]_Adzes (udlimau)._--Even at the present day the Eskimo of Point Barrowuse no tool for shaping large pieces of woodwork, except ashorthandled adz, hafted in the same manner as the old stone toolswhich were employed before the introduction of iron. Though axes andhatchets are frequently obtained by trading, they are never used assuch, but the head is removed and rehafted so as to make an adz of it.This habit is not peculiar to the people of Point Barrow. There is ahatchet head, mounted in the same way, from the Anderson River, in theMuseum collection, and the same thing was noted in Hudson’s Strait byCapt. Lyon[N282] and at Iglulik by Capt. Parry.[N283] Mr. L. M. Turnerinforms me that the Eskimo of Ungava, on the south side of Hudson’sStrait, who have been long in contact with the whites, have learned touse axes. The collection contains two such adzes made from smallhatchets. No. 89873 [972], Fig. 128, is the more typical of the two.The blade is the head of a small hatchet or tomahawk lashed to thehaft of oak with a stout thong of seal hide. The lashing is one piece,and is put on wet and shrunk tightly on. This tool is a little longerin the haft than those commonly used, and the shape and material ofthe haft is a little unusual, it being generally elliptical in sectionand made of soft wood.    [Footnote N282: Journal, p. 28.]    [Footnote N283: 2d Voyage, p. 536, and pl. opp. p. 548, fig. 3.]  [Illustration: FIG. 128.--Hatchet hafted as an adz. 1/3]Fig. 129, No. 56638 [309], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a similar adz, but thehead has been narrowed by cutting off pieces from the sides (done byfiling part way through and breaking the piece off), and a deeptransverse groove has been cut on the front face near the butt. Partof the lashing is held in this groove as well as by the eye, the lowerhalf of which is filled up with a wooden plug. The haft is peculiar inbeing a piece of reindeer antler which has been reduced in thicknessby sawing out a slice for 8 inches from the butt and bringing the twoparts together with four stout wooden treenails about 1½ inches apart.This is preferable to trimming it down to a proper thickness from thesurface, as the latter process would remove the compact tissue of theoutside and expose the soft inside tissue. The whipping of seal thongjust above the flange of the butt helps to give a better grip and, atthe same time, to hold the parts together. As before, there are twolarge holes for the lashing. Adzes of this sort are used for all largepieces of wood work, such as timbers for boats, planks, and beams forhouses, etc. After roughly dressing these out with the adz they areneatly smoothed off with the crooked knife, or sometimes, of lateyears, with the plane. The work of “getting out” the large pieces ofwood is almost always done where the drift log lies on the beach. Whena man wants a new stem or sternpost for his umiak, or a plank torepair his house, he searches along the beach until he finds asuitable piece of driftwood, which he claims by putting a mark on it,and sometimes hauls up out of the way of the waves. Then, when he hasleisure to go at the work, he goes out with his adz and spends the daygetting it into shape and reducing it to a convenient size to carryhome, either slung on his back or, if too large, on a dog-sled. A manseldom takes the trouble to carry home more of a piece of timber thanhe actually needs for the purpose in hand.  [Illustration: FIG. 129.--Hatchet hafted as an adz. 1/3]The adz was in general use long before the introduction of iron. Thereis in the collection a very interesting series of ancient tools,showing the gradual development of the implement from a rude oblongblock of stone worked down to a cutting edge on one end, to the steeladzes of the present day. They have, however, not even yet learned tomake an eye in the head of the tool in which to insert the haft, butall tools of this class--adzes, hammers, picks, and mattocks--arelashed, with one face resting against the expanded end of the haft.Firmness is obtained by putting the lashing on wet and allowing it toshrink tight. Nearly all these ancient adzes are of jade, a materialwell adapted for the purpose by its hardness, which, however, rendersit difficult to work. Probably the oldest of these adzes is No. 56675[69], Fig. 130, which has been selected as the type of the earliestform we have represented in the collection. This is of dark olivegreen, almost black, jade, 7.2 inches long, 2.8 wide, and 1.3 thick,and smoothly ground on the broader faces. The cutting edge is muchbroken from long use. One broad face is pretty smoothly ground, butleft rough at the butt end. The other is rather flatter, but more thanhalf of it is irregularly concave, the natural inequalities beinghardly touched by grinding. Like the other dark-colored jade tools,this specimen is very much lighter on a freshly fractured surface. Thedark color is believed to be due to long contact with greasysubstances.  [Illustration: FIG. 130.--Adz-head of jade. 1/3]  [Illustration: FIG. 131.--Adz-head of jade. 1/3]No. 89662 [900], from Nuwŭk, is an exceedingly rough adz of similarshape, but so slightly ground that it is probably one that was laidaside unfinished. From the battered appearance of the ends it seems tohave been used for a hammer. It is of the same dark jade as thepreceding. No. 89689 [792], from Utkiavwĭñ, is of rather light olive,opaque jade and a trifle better finished than the type, while No.89661 [1155], Fig. 131, also from Utkiavwĭñ, is a still better pieceof workmanship, the curve of the faces to the cutting edge being verygraceful. The interesting point about this specimen is that a straightpiece has been cut off from one side by sawing down smoothly from eachface almost to the middle and breaking the piece off. We were informedthat this was done to procure rods of jade for making knifesharpeners. We were informed that these stones were cut in the sameway as marble and freestone are cut with us, namely, by sawing with aflat blade of iron and sand and water. A thin lamina of hard bone wasprobably used before the introduction of iron. Possibly a reindeerscapula, cut like the one made into a saw (No. 89476 [1206], Fig.147), but without teeth, was used for this purpose.  [Illustration: FIG. 132.--Hafted jade adz. 1/2]That such stone blades were used with a haft is shown by the onlyhafted specimen, No. 56628 [214], Fig. 132, from Nuwŭk. This is arather small adz. The head of dark green jade differs from thosealready described only in dimensions, being 4 inches long, 2.1 wide,and 1.7 thick. The haft is of reindeer antler and in shape much likethat of No. 56638 [309], but has only one hole for the lashing. Thelashing is of the usual stout seal thong and put on in the usualfashion. No. 89673 [1423] is an old black adz from Sidaru of the samepattern as those described, but very smoothly and neatly made. Aboutone-half of this specimen has been cut off for whetstones, etc.The next step is to make the lashing more secure by cutting transversegrooves on the upper face of the head to hold the thong in place. Thishas been done on No. 56667 [215], figured in Point Barrow Rept.,Ethnology, Pl. II, Fig. 5, an adz of dark olive green jade, fromUtkiavwĭñ, which shows two such grooves, broad and shallow, runningacross the upper face. Of these two classes the collection containsthirteen unhafted specimens and one hafted specimen, all of jade. Ascutting these grooves in the stone is a laborious process, the deviceof substituting some more easily worked substance for the back part ofthe head would naturally suggest itself.  [Illustration: FIG. 133.--Adz-head of jade and bone. 1/3]  [Illustration: FIG. 134.--Adz-head of bone and iron, without eyes.  1/3]Fig. 133, No. 89658 [1072], from Utkiavwĭñ, has a long blade of blackstone with the butt slightly tapered off and imbedded in a body ofwhale’s bone, which has a channel 1 inch wide, for the lashing, cutround it and a shallow socket on the face to receive the end of thehaft. Adz heads of this same type continued in use till after theintroduction of iron, which was at first utilized by inserting a flatblade of iron into just such a body, as is shown in Fig. 134(No. 89877 [752], from the cemetery at Utkiavwĭñ).  [Illustration: FIG. 135.--Adz-head of bone and iron, with vertical  eyes. 1/3]  [Illustration: FIG. 136.--Adz-head of bone and iron, with vertical  eyes. 1/3]From this type to that shown in Fig. 135 (No. 89876 [696] brought bythe natives from the ruins on the Kulugrua) the transition is easy.Suppose, for the greater protection of the lashings, we _inclose_ thechannels on the sides of the head--in other words, bore holes insteadof cutting grooves--we have exactly this pattern, namely, verticaleyes on each side of the head joined by transverse channels on theupper face. The specimen figured has on each side two oblong slotswith a round eye between them. The blade is of iron, Fig. 136, No.56640 [260] has two eyes on each side, and shows a different method ofattaching the blade, which is countersunk flush with the upper surfaceof the body and secured with three stout iron rivets. The next step isto substitute horizontal eyes for the vertical ones, so as to haveonly one set of holes to thread the lashings through. This is seen inNo. 89869 [878], Fig. 137, from Nuwŭk, which in general patternclosely resembles No. 89876 [696], but has three large horizontal eyesinstead of the vertical ones. The blade is of iron and the haft ofwhale’s bone. The lashing is essentially the same as that of themodern adz, No. 56638 [309].  [Illustration: FIG. 137.--Hafted bone and iron adz. 1/4]That this final type of hafting was reached before stone had gone outof use for such implements is shown by Fig. 138, No. 89839 [769], fromUtkiavwĭñ, which, while very like the last in shape, has a blade ofhard, dark purple slate. The haft is of reindeer antler. The lashinghas the short end _knotted_ to the long part after making the firstround, instead of being slit to receive the latter. Otherwise it is ofthe usual pattern. These composite adzes of bone and stone or ironseemed to have been common at the end of the period when stone wasexclusively used and when iron first came into use in smallquantities, and a good many have been preserved until the present day.We obtained four hafted and six unhafted specimens, besides seven jadeblades for such composite adzes, which are easily recognizable bytheir small size and their shape. They are usually broad and ratherthin, and narrowed to the butt, as is seen in Fig. 139, No. 56685[71], a beautiful little adz of bright green jade 2.8 inches long and2.3 wide, from Utkiavwĭñ. No. 56670 [246] also from Utkiavwĭñ, is asimilar blade of greenish jade slightly larger, being 3.4 inches longand 2 inches wide. No. 89670 [1092] is a tiny blade of hard,fine-grained black stone, probably oil-soaked jade, only 1.7 incheslong and 1.5 wide. It is very smoothly ground. Such little adzes, wewere told, were especially used for cutting bone. The implement,[N284]which Nordenskiöld calls a “stone chisel,” found in the ruins of anold Eskimo house at Cape North, is evidently the head of one of theselittle bone adzes, as is plainly seen on comparing this figure withthe larger adzes figured above.    [Footnote N284: Figured in the Voyage of the _Vega_, vol. 1,    p. 444, Fig. 1.]  [Illustration: FIG. 138.--Hafted bone and stone adz. 1/3]  [Illustration: FIG. 139.--Small adz-blade of green jade. 1/2]I have figured two more composite adzes, which are quite differentfrom the rest. No. 89838 [1109], Fig. 140, has a blade of neatlyflaked gray flint, but this as well as the unusually straight haft isnewly made. These are fitted to a very old bone body, which when wholewas not over 3 inches long, and was probably part of a little boneadz. There is no evidence that these people ever used flint adzes.Fig. 141, No. 89872 [785], is introduced to show how the native hasutilized an old cooper’s adz, of which the eye was probably broken, byfitting it with a bone body.  [Illustration: FIG. 140.--Hafted adz of bone and flint. 1/3]While the adzes already described appear to have been thepredominating types, another form was sometimes used. Fig. 142,No. 89874 [964], from Nuwŭk, represents this form. The haft is ofwhale’s rib, 1 foot long, and the head of _bone_, apparently whale’sscapula, 5.6 inches long and 2.8 inches wide on the edge. There is anadze in the Museum from the Mackenzie River region with a _steel_blade of precisely the same pattern. That adzes of this patternsometimes had stone blades is probable. No. 89840 [1317], is aclumsily made _commercial_ tool of this type, with a small head ofgreenish slate. It has an unusually straight haft, which isdisproportionately long and thick.  [Illustration: FIG. 141.--Old cooper’s adz, rehafted. 1/3]All these adzes, ancient and modern, are hafted upon essentially thesame pattern. The short curved haft, the shape of which issufficiently well indicated by the figures, seems to have beengenerally made of whale’s rib or reindeer antler, both of which have anatural curve suited to the shape of the haft. A “branch” of areindeer’s antler is particularly well suited for the haft of a smalladze. Not only does it have naturally the proper dimensions and asuitable curve, but it is very easy, by cutting out a small segment ofthe “beam” where the “branch” starts from it, to make a flange of aconvenient shape for fitting to the head. Antler is besides easilyobtained, not only when the deer is killed for food, but by picking upshed antlers on the tundra, and is consequently employed for manypurposes. The haft usually has a knob at the tip to keep the hand fromslipping, and the grip is sometimes roughened with cross cuts or woundwith thong. There are usually as many holes for the lashing as thereare eyes in the head, though there are two holes when the head hasonly one large eye. On the bone heads, the surfaces to which the haftis applied and the channels for the lashings are roughened with crosscuts to prevent slipping. The lashing always follows the same generalplan, though no two adzes are lashed exactly alike. The plan may besummarized as follows: One end of the thong makes a turn through oneof the holes in the haft, and around or through the head. This turn isthen secured, usually by passing the long end through a slit in theshort end and hauling this loop taut, sometimes by knotting the shortend to the long part, or by catching the short end down under the nextturn. The long part then makes several turns round or through the headand through the haft, sometimes also crossing around the latter, andthe whole is then finished off by wrapping the end two or three timesaround the turns on one side and tucking it neatly underneath. This isvery like the method of lashing on the heads of the mauls alreadydescribed, but the mauls have only one hole in the haft, and there arerarely any turns around the latter.  [Illustration: FIG. 142.--Adz with bone blade. 1/3]Jade adz blades, like those already described, have been brought byMr. Nelson from Kotzebue Sound, the Diomedes, St. Michaels, etc., andone came from as far south as the Kuskoquim River._Chisels._--We collected a number of small short handled chisels,resembling the implements called “trinket makers,” of which there areso many in the National Museum. We never happened to see them inactual use, but were informed that they were especially designed forworking on reindeer antler. Of the eight specimens collected No. 89302[884], Fig. 143, has been selected as a type of the antler chisel(kĭ´ñnusa). The blade is of steel, and the haft is of reindeer antler,in two longitudinal sections, put together at right angles to theplane of the blade, held together by a stout round bone treenail 2½inches from the butt. The square tip of the blade is beveled on bothfaces to a rough cutting edge. Fig. 144 (No. 89301) [1000] has a smallblade with an oblique tip _not_ beveled to an edge, and a haft ofwalrus ivory yellowed from age, and ornamented with rows of rings,each with a dot in the center, all incised and colored with red ocher.The two parts of the haft are fastened together by a stout woodentreenail and a _stitch_ of whalebone.  [Illustration: FIG. 143.--Antler chisel. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 144.--Antler chisel. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 145.--Spurious tool, flint blade. 1/2]The rest of the steel-bladed chisels, four in number, are all of aboutthe same size and hafted with antler. The blades are somewhatirregular in shape, but all have square or oblique tips and no sharpedge. Three of them have the sections of the haft put together asdescribed, and fastened by a treenail and a whipping of seal twine orsinew braid at the tip. One has the two sections put together in theplane of the blade and fastened with a large copper rivet, which alsopasses through the butt of the blade, and three stout iron ones. Thehafts of all these tools show signs of much handling. The remainingtwo specimens have blades of black flint. No. 89637 [1207], has a haftof walrus ivory, of the usual pattern, fastened together by a bonetreenail and two stitches, one of sinew braid and one of seal thong.The lashing of seal twine near the tip serves to mend a crack. Thehaft is old and rusty about the slot into which the blade is fitted,showing that it originally had an iron blade. The flint blade wasprobably put in to make it seem ancient, as there was a special demandfor prehistoric articles. No. 89653 [1290], Fig. 145, is nothing but afanciful tool made to meet this demand. The haft is of light-brownmountain sheep horn, and the blade of black flint. Such flint-bladedtools may have been used formerly, but there is no proof that theywere._Whalebone shaves._--There is in use at Point Barrow, and apparentlynot elsewhere among the Eskimo, a special tool for shaving whalebone,a substance which is very much used in the form of long, thin stripsfor fastening together boat timbers, whipping spear shafts, etc. Thethin, long shavings which curl up like “curled hair,” are carefullysaved and used for the padding between stocking and boot. Whalebone isalso sometimes shaved for this special purpose. The tool isessentially a little spokeshave about 4 inches long, which is held bythe index and second finger of the right hand, one on each handle,with the thumb pressed against one end, and is drawn toward theworkman. The collection contains three specimens of the ordinary form(sávigɐ), represented by No. 89306 [885] (figured in Point BarrowReport, Ethnology, Pl. III, Fig. 6). This has a steel blade and a haftof walrus ivory. The upper face of the haft is convex and the underflat, and the blade, which is beveled only on the upper face, is setat a slight inclination to the flat face of the haft. The edge of theblade projects 0.2 inch from the haft above and 0.3 below. The hole atone end of the haft is for a lanyard to hang it up by. The other twoare of essentially the same pattern, but have hafts of reindeerantler.  [Illustration: FIG. 146.--Whalebone shave, slate blade. 1/2]The collection also contains six tools of this description, with stoneblades, but they are all new and very carelessly made, with hafts ofcoarse-grained bone. The shape of the tools is shown in Fig. 146, No.89649 [1213], from Utkiavwĭñ, which has a rough blade of soft, lightgreenish slate. The other five have blades of black or gray flint,roughly flaked. All these blades are glued in with oil dregs. No.89652 [1225] is like the others in shape, but more neatly made, and ispeculiar in having a blade of hard, compact bone. This is inserted bysawing a deep, narrow slit along one side of the haft from end to end.The blade is wedged into the middle of the slit, the ends of which areneatly filled in with slips of the same material as the haft. This wasthe only tool of the kind seen. It is very probable that shaves ofstone were formerly used, though we obtained no genuine specimens. Theuse of oblong chips of flint for this purpose would naturally suggestitself to a savage, and the convenience of fitting these flakes into alittle haft would soon occur to him. No. 89616 [1176] is such anoblong flint, flaked to an edge on one face, which is evidently old,and which was said to have been used for shaving whalebone. Thematerial is black flint. Whalebone is often shaved nowadays with acommon knife. The slab of bone is laid upon the thigh and the edge ofthe knife pressed firmly against it, with the blade perpendicular tothe surface of the slab, which is drawn rapidly under it._Saws._--If the Eskimo had not already invented the saw before theybecame acquainted with the whites they readily adopted the tool evenwhen they had scanty materials for making it. Crantz[N285] speaks of“a little lock saw” as one of a Greenlander’s regular tools in histime, and Egede[N286] mentions handsaws as a regular article of trade.Capt. Parry[N287] found the natives of Iglulik, in 1821-1823, using asaw made of a notched piece of iron. On our asking Nĭkawa´alu, oneday, what they had for tools before they got iron he said that theyhad drills made of seal bones and saws made of the shoulder blade ofthe reindeer. Some time afterwards he brought over a model of such asaw, which he said was exactly like those formerly used. Fig. 147, No.89476 [1206], represents this specimen. It is made by cutting off theanterior edge of a reindeer’s scapula in a straight line parallel tothe posterior edge and cutting fine saw teeth on this thin edge. Thespine is also cut off nearly flat. This makes a tool very much like acarpenter’s backsaw, the narrow part of the scapula forming aconvenient handle.    [Footnote N285: History of Greenland, vol. 1, p. 149.]    [Footnote N286: Greenland, p. 175.]    [Footnote N287: 2d Voyage, p. 536.]  [Illustration: FIG. 147.--Saw made of deer’s scapula. 1/4]Fig. 148, No. 56559 [15], shows how other implements were utilizedbefore it was easy to obtain saws in plenty. It is a common case knifestamped on the blade, “Wilson, Hawksworth, ----n & Co., Sheffield,”which perhaps came from the _Plover_, with saw teeth cut on the edge.It was picked up at the Utkiavwĭñ cemetery, where it had been exposedwith a corpse. Saws are now a regular article of trade, and most ofthe natives are provided with them of various styles and makes. Thename for saw is uluă´ktun.  [Illustration: FIG. 148.--Saw made of a case-knife. 1/3]_Drills and borers._--The use of the bow drill appears to be universalamong the Eskimo. Those at present employed at Point Barrow do notdiffer from the large series collected at the Mackenzie and Andersonrivers by MacFarlane. The drill is a slender rod of steel worked to adrill point and imbedded in a stout wooden shaft, which is tapered toa rounded tip. This fits into a stone socket imbedded in a woodenblock, which is held between the teeth, so that the point of the drillcan be pressed down against the object to be drilled by the head,leaving both hands free to work the short bow, which has a loosestring of thong long enough to make one turn round the shaft. Thecollection contains ten of these modern steel or iron drills, fifteenbows, and seven mouthpieces. No. 89502 [853], figured in Point BarrowRept., Ethnology, Pl. II, Fig. 1, has been selected as a typical drill(niă´ktun). The drill is a cylindrical rod of steel beaten out into asmall lanceolate point, which is filed sharp on the edges. The shaftis made of hard wood. The remaining drills are of essentially the samepattern, varying in total length from about 11 inches to 16½.Fig. 149, No. 89499 [968] shows a somewhat unusual shape of shaft. Thelashings round the large end are to keep it from splitting any morethan it has done already. The drill is of iron and the shaft ofspruce, which was once painted with red ocher.  [Illustration: FIG. 149.--Bow drill. 1/3]  [Illustration: FIG. 150.--Bow drill and mouthpiece. 1/4]No. 89497 [819] (Fig. 150) has a ferrule of coarse-grained bone neatlypegged on with two small pegs of the same material. This is unusualwith steel drills. The shaft is of spruce and of the same shape as inthe preceding specimen. No. 89595 [875] (Fig. 151) is figured to showthe way in which the shaft has been mended. A wedge-shaped piece 3½inches long and 0.3 to 0.4 inch wide has been split out of the largeend and replaced by a fresh piece of wood neatly fitted in and securedby two tight whippings of sinew braid, each in a deep groove.No. 89515 [861], figured in Point Barrow Report, Ethnology, Pl. II,Fig. 2, is a typical bow (pizĭksuá) for use with these drills. It isof walrus ivory, 16 inches long and oval in section. Through each endis drilled a transverse hole. A string of seal thong 21 inches long islooped into one of these holes by passing one end of the thong throughthe hole, cutting a slit in it, and passing the other end throughthis. The other end is passed through the other hole and knotted atthe tip.These bows vary slightly in dimensions, but are not less than a footor more than 16 inches long, and are almost always of walrus ivory.No. 89508 [956] (Fig. 152), is an old and rudely made bow ofwhalebone, which is more strongly arched than usual, and has thestring attached to notches at the ends instead of into holes. This wassaid to belong with an old bone drill, No. 89498 [956]. Both came fromNuwŭk. These bows are often highly ornamented both by carving and withincised patterns colored with red ocher or soot. The following figuresare introduced to show some of the different styles of ornamentation.Fig. 153_a_, No. 56506 [298] is unusually broad and flat and wasprobably made for a handle to a tool bag. Such handles, however,appear to be also used for drill bows. The tips of this bow representseals heads, and have good sized sky-blue glass beads inserted foreyes. The rest of the ornamentation is incised and blackened. Fig.153_b_, No. 89421 [1260], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a similar bow, which hasincised on the back figures of men and animals, which, perhaps, tellof some real event. Mr. L. M. Turner informs me that the natives ofNorton Sound keep a regular record of hunting and other eventsengraved in this way upon their drill bows, and that no one everventures to falsify these records. We did not learn definitely thatsuch was the rule at Point Barrow, but we have one bag-handle markedwith whales, which we were told indicated the number killed by theowner. Fig. 153_c_, No. 89425 [1732], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a similarbow, ornamented on the back with simply an incised border colored red.On the other side are the figures of ten bearded seals, cross-hatchedand blackened. These are perhaps a “score.” Fig. 153_d_, No. 89509[914], from Nuwŭk, is a bow of the common pattern, but ornamented bycarving the back into a toothed keel.  [Illustration: FIG. 151.--Bow drill. 1/4]Fig. 153_e_, No. 89510 [961], from Utkiavwĭñ, is ornamented on oneside only with an incised pattern, which is blackened. Fig. 153_f_,No. 89511 [961], also from Utkiavwĭñ, has, in addition to the incisedand blackened pattern, a small transparent sky-blue glass bead inlaidin the middle of the back. Fig. 153_g_, No. 89512 [836], from the sameplace, is a flat bow with the edges carved into scallops. The incisedline along the middle of the back is colored with red ocher. Thestring is made of sinew braid.  [Illustration: FIG. 152.--Drill bow. 1/4]Fig. 154, No. 89777 [1004_b_], which belongs in the “kit” ofIlû´bw’ga, the Nunatañmiun, previously mentioned, is interesting fromhaving been lengthened 3¼ inches by riveting on a piece of reindeerantler at one end. The two pieces are neatly joined in a “lap splice”about 2 inches long and fastened with three iron rivets. The ownerappears to have concluded that his drill bow was too short when he wasat home, in the interior, where he could obtain no walrus ivory. Theincised pattern on the back is colored with red ocher.The mouthpiece (kĭ´ñmia) consists of a block of hard stone (rarelyiron), in which is hollowed out a round cup-like socket, large enoughto receive the tip of the drill shaft, imbedded in a block of wood ofa suitable size to hold between the teeth. This block often has curvedflanges on each side, which rest against the cheeks. Such mouthpiecesare common all along the coast from the Anderson River to NortonSound, as is shown by the Museum collection. No. 89500 [800], figuredin Point Barrow Report, Ethnology, Pl. II, Fig. 3, is a type of theflanged mouthpiece. The block is of pine, carved into a thick, broadarch, with a large block on the inside. Into the top of the arch isinlaid a piece of gray porphyry with black spots, which is slightlyconvex on the surface, so as to project a little above the surface ofthe wood. In the middle of the stone is a cup-shaped cavity one-halfinch in diameter and of nearly the same depth. This is a rather largemouthpiece, being 6 inches across from one end of the arch to theother.  [Illustration: FIG. 153.--Drill bows. 3/8]  [Illustration: FIG. 154.--Spliced drill bow. 1/4]There are two other specimens of the same pattern, both rathersmaller. No. 89503 [891], Fig. 150, from Nuwŭk, has the stone of blackand white syenite. This specimen is very old and dirty, and wornthrough to the stone on one side, where the teeth have come againstit. No. 89787 [1004_c_], Fig. 155, is almost exactly the same shape asthe type, but has for a socket a piece of iron 1.1 inches square,hollowed out as usual. The outside of the wood has been painted withred ocher, but this is mostly worn off. This mouthpiece belonged toIlû´bw’ga.  [Illustration: FIG. 155.--Drill mouthpiece, with iron socket. 1/2]Fig. 156, No. 89505 [892], from Utkiavwĭñ, represents the patternwhich is perhaps rather commoner than the preceding. The wood, whichholds the socket of black and white syenite, is simply an ellipticalblock of spruce. The remaining three specimens are of the same patternand of the same material as the last, except No. 89507 [908], fromNuwŭk, in which the wood is oak. As it appears very old, this wood mayhave come from the _Plover_.When not in use, the point of the drill is sometimes protected with asheath. One such sheath was obtained, No. 89447 [1112], figured inPoint Barrow Report, Ethnology, Pl. II, Fig. 1. It is of walrus ivory,3-6 inches long. The end of a piece of thong is passed through the eyeand the other part fastened round the open end with a marline-hitch,catching down the end. This leaves a lanyard 9¼ inches long, which ishitched or knotted round the shaft of the drill when the sheath isfitted over the point.  [Illustration: FIG. 156.--Drill mouthpiece without wings. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 157.--Bone-pointed drill. 1/4]The drills above described are used for perforating all sorts ofmaterial, wood, bone, ivory, metal, etc., and are almost the onlyboring implements used, even awls being unusual. Before theintroduction of iron, the point was made of one of the small bonesfrom a seal’s leg. We obtained four specimens of these bone drills, ofwhich two, at least, appear to be genuine. No. 89498 [956], Fig. 157,is one of these, from Nuwŭk. The shaft is of the ordinary pattern andmade of some hard wood, but the point is a roughly cylindrical rod ofbone, expanding at the point, where it is convex on one face andconcave on the other and beveled on both faces into two cutting edges,which meet in an acute angle. The larger end of the shaft has beensplit and mended by whipping it for about three-quarters of an inchwith sinew braid. No. 89518 [1174], is apparently also genuine, and islike the preceding, but beveled only on the concave face of the point,which is rather obtuse. No. 89519 [1258] was made for the market. Ithas a rude shaft of whale’s bone, but a carefully made bone point ofprecisely the pattern of the modern iron ones. No. 89520 [1182] has noshaft, and appears to be an old unfinished drill fitted into acarelessly made bone ferrule.The drill at the present day is always worked with a bow, which allowsone hand to be used for steadying the piece of work. We were informed,however, that formerly a cord was sometimes used without the bow, butfurnished with a transverse handle at each end.We collected six little handles of ivory, carved into some ornamentalshape, each with an eye in the middle to which a thong could beattached. All were old, and we never saw them in use. The first twowere collected at an early period of our acquaintance with thesepeople, and from our imperfect knowledge of the language we got theimpression that they were handles to be attached to a harpoon line.We were not long, however in finding out that the harpoon has no suchappendage, and when the other four came in a year later, at a timewhen the press of other work prevented careful inquiry into their use,we supposed that they were meant for handles to the lines used fordragging dead seals, as they somewhat resemble such an implement. Onour return home, when I had opportunities for making a careful studyof the collection, I found that none of the drag lines, either in ourown collection or in those of the Museum, had handles of thisdescription. On the other hand, I found many similar implements in Mr.Nelson’s collection labeled “drill-cord handles,” and finally one pair(No. 36319, from Kashunuk, near Cape Romanzoff), still attached to thedrill cord. These handles are almost identical in shape with No. 89458[835], from Utkiavwĭñ. This leaves no doubt in my mind that theso-called “drag-line handles” in our collection are nothing more thanhandles for drill cords, now wholly obsolete and supplanted by thebows already described. I have figured all six of these handles toshow the different patterns of ornamentation. They are all made ofwalrus ivory, and are all “odd” handles, no two being mates. Fig.158_a_ (No. 56526) [86], is 5.2 inches long, and light blue beads areinserted for eyes in the seal’s heads. The eye for the drill cord ismade by boring two median holes at the middle of one side so that theymeet under the surface and make a longitudinal channel.  [Illustration: FIG. 158.--Handles for drill cords. 1/4]Fig. 158_b_ (No. 56527 [23] from Utkiavwĭñ), is 4.3 inches long, andis very accurately carved into the image of a man’s right leg andfoot, dressed in a striped deerskin boot. The end opposite to the footis the head of some animal, perhaps a wolf, with bits of dark woodinlaid for eyes. The eye is a simple large transverse hole through thethigh.Fig. 158_c_ (No. 89455 [929] from Nuwŭk), is 5.9 inches long. The eyeis drilled lengthwise through a large lump projecting from the middleof one side. Small blue beads are inlaid for the eyes, and one toindicate the male genital opening.Fig. 158_d_ (No. 89456 [930] from Nuwŭk) is like No. 56527 [23], butrepresents the left foot and is not so artistically carved. It is 3.7inches long.Fig. 158_e_ (No. 89457 [925] from Nuwŭk) is 4.7 inches long, andresembles No. 89455 [929], but has instead of the seal’s tail andflippers a large ovoid knob ornamented with incised and blackenedrings. The “eye” is bored transversely.Fig. 158_f_ (No. 89458 [835] from Utkiavwĭñ) differs from No. 89455[925] in having a transverse eye, and being less artistically carved.Bits of lead are inlaid for the eyes. It is 4.4 inches long. The nameof this implement is kû´ñ-i.We obtained six specimens of an old flint tool, consisting of a ratherlong thick blade mounted in a straight haft about 10 inches long, ofwhich we had some difficulty in ascertaining the use. We were at lastable to be quite sure that they were intended for drilling, or ratherreaming out, the large cavity in the base of the ivory head of a whaleharpoon, which fits upon the conical tip of the fore-shaft. The shapeof the blade is well fitted for this purpose. It is not unlikely thatsuch tools, worked as these are, by hand, preceded the bone drills forboring all sorts of objects, and that the habit of using them formaking the whale harpoon was kept up from the same conservatismfounded on superstition which surrounds the whole whale fishery. (Seeunder “Whale fishing,” where the subject will be more fullydiscussed.) No. 89626 [870], figured in Point Barrow Report,Ethnology, Pl. II, Fig. 4, is a typical implement of this class(ītaun, i´tûgetsau´). The blade is of black flint, flaked, 2 incheslong, imbedded in the end of a haft of spruce, 10.5 inches long. Theblade is held in place by whipping the cleft end of the haft withsinew braid.Two of the other specimens, No. 89627 [937] and No. 89628 [912], areof essentially the same pattern and material, but have rounded hafts.No. 89629 [960] and No. 89630 [1068], Figs. 159_a_, 159_b_, haveblades of the same pattern, but have hafts fitted for use with themouthpiece and bow, showing that sometimes, at least in later times,these tools were so used. No. 89625 [1217] (Fig. 160) has no haft, butthe blade, which is rather narrow in proportion to its length (2.3inches by 0.5), is fitted into a short ferrule of antler, with alittle dovetail on the edge for attaching it to the haft.Of awls we saw only one specimen, which, perhaps, ought rather to beconsidered a little hand drill. This is No. 89308 [1292], Fig. 161,from Utkiavwĭñ. The point is the tip of a common three-cornered file,sharpened down. It is imbedded in a handle of fossil ivory which hasturned a light yellowish brown from age. Its total length is 2.8inches.  [Illustration: FIG. 159.--Flint-bladed reamers. 1/3]_Hammers._--At the present day nearly every man has been able toprocure an iron hammer of some kind, which he uses with greathandiness. Before the introduction of iron, in addition to the boneand stone mauls above described as bone crushers, unhafted pebbles ofconvenient shape were also employed. No. 56661 [274] is such a stone.It is an ovoid water-worn pebble of greenish gray quartzite, 3½ incheslong. The ends are battered, showing how it had been used. It wasbrought from one of the rivers in the interior by one of the nativesof Utkiavwĭñ._Files._--Files of all kinds are eagerly sought after by the natives,who use them with very great skill and patience, doing nearly alltheir metal work with these tools. For instance, one particularlyingenious native converted his Winchester rifle from a rim fire to acentral fire with nothing but a file. To do this he had to make a newfiring pin, as the firing pin of the rim-fire gun is too short toreach the head of the cartridge. He accomplished this by accuratelycutting off, to the proper length, an old worn-out three-corneredfile. He then filed off enough of each edge so that the rod fittedevenly in the cylindrical hole where the firing pin works. The workwas done so carefully that the new firing pin worked perfectly, and hehad only to complete the job by cutting off his central fire cartridgeshells to a proper length to fit the chamber of the gun.  [Illustration: FIG. 160.--Flint-bladed reamer. 3/4]  [Illustration: FIG. 161.--Awl. 3/4]They have almost no knowledge of working metal with the aid of heat,as is natural from the scarcity of fuel. I have, however, seen themroughly temper small articles, such as fire steels, etc., by heatingthem in the fire and quenching them in cold water. One native veryneatly mended a musket barrel which had been cracked by firing tooheavy a charge. He cut a section from another old barrel of somewhatlarger caliber, which he heated until it had expanded enough to slipdown over the crack, and then allowed it to shrink on.  [Illustration: FIG. 162.--Jade whetstones. 1/2]_Whetstones_ (ipiksaun).--Knives are generally sharpened with a file,cutting a bevel, as before mentioned, on one face of the blade only.To “set” or “turn” the edge they use pieces of steel of variousshapes, generally with a hole drilled in them so that they can be hungto the breeches belt by a lanyard. One man, for instance, used abouthalf of a razor blade for this purpose, and another a small horseshoemagnet. In former times they employed a very elegant implement,consisting of a slender rod of jade from 3 to 7 inches long, with alanyard attached to an eye in the larger end. These were sometimesmade by cutting a piece from one of the old jade adzes in the manneralready described. There are a few of these whetstones still in use atthe present day, and they are very highly prized. We succeeded inobtaining nine specimens, of which No. 89618 [801], Fig. 162_a_, hasbeen selected as the type. It is of hard black stone, probably jade,6.3 inches long. Through the wider end is drilled a large eye, intowhich is neatly spliced one end of a stout flat braid of sinew 4¾inches long.The remaining whetstones are of very much the same pattern. I havefigured five of them, to show the slight variations. Fig. 162_b_(No. 56662 [393], from Utkiavwĭñ) is of light grayish green jade,smoothly polished and 4.1 inches long. It is chamfered only on thesmall end at right angles to the breadth, and has the eye prolongedinto ornamental grooves on the two opposite faces. The long lanyard isof common sinew braid. No. 56663 [229] (from the same village) is ofolive green, slightly translucent jade, 6.8 inches long, andelliptical in section, also chamfered only at the small end. Thelanyard, which is a strip of seal thong 9 inches long, is secured inthe eye, as described before, with two slits, one in the standing partthrough which the end is passed and the other in the end with thestanding part passed through it. No. 89617 [1262] (from Sidaru) is ofolive green, translucent jade, 6.1 inches long, and shaped like thetype, but chamfered only at the small end. The lanyard of seal thongis secured in the eye by a large round knot in one end. No. 89619[837] (from Utkiavwĭñ) is of bright green, translucent jade, 5.1inches long, and unusually thick, its greatest diameter being 0.6inch. The tip is gradually worked off to an oblique edge, and it hasornamental grooves running through the eye like No. 56662 [393].  [Illustration: FIG. 163.--Jade whetstones. 3/4]No. 89620 [865] (from Nuwŭk) is shaped very much like the type, buthas the tip tapered off almost to a point. It is of olive green,slightly translucent jade and is 7 inches long. The lanyard is a pieceof sinew braid with the ends knotted together and the bight loopedinto the eye. A large sky-blue glass bead is slipped on over bothparts of the lanyard and pushed up close to the loop. Fig. 163_a_(No. 89621 [757], from Utkiavwĭñ) is very short and broad (3.6 inchesby 0.6), is chamfered at both ends, and has the ornamental grooves atthe eye. The material is a hard, opaque, bluish gray stone, veinedwith black.A whetstone of similar material was brought by Lieut. Stoney fromKotzebue Sound. The long lanyard is of sinew braid. Fig. 163_b_(No. 89622 [951], also from Utkiavwĭñ) is a very small, slenderwhetstone, 3.3 inches long, of dark olive green semitranslucent jade,polished. The tip is not chamfered, but tapers to a blunt point. Ithas the ornamental grooves at the eye. These are undoubtedly the“stones for making . . . whetstones, or these ready-made” referred toby Dr. Simpson (Op. cit., p. 266) as brought by the Nunatañmiun fromthe people of the “Ko-wak River.” A few such whetstones have beencollected on other parts of the northwest coast as far south as thenorthern shore of Norton Sound. The broken whetstone mentioned aboveis of a beautiful bluish green translucent jade. Bits of stone arealso used for whetstones, such as No. 89786 [1004_f_], which belong inIlû´bw’ga’s tool bag. They are two rough, oblong bits of hard darkgray slate, apparently split off a flat, weathered surface.  [Illustration: FIG. 164.--Wooden tool boxes. 1/6]_Tool boxes and bags._--We collected six specimens of a peculiarlyshaped long, narrow box, carved from a single block of wood, which wewere informed were formerly used for holding tools. They have gone outof fashion at the present day, and there are but few of them left. No.89860 [1152], Fig. 164_a_, represents the typical shape of this box.It is carved from a single block of pine. The cover is slightlyhollowed on the under side and is held on by two double rings of twine(one of seal twine and the other of sinew braid), large enough to slipover the end. Each ring is made by doubling a long piece of twine sothat the two parts are equal, passing one end through the bight andknotting it to the other. The box and cover seem to have been paintedinside and out with red ocher. On the outside this is mostly faded andworn off and covered with dirt, but inside it has turned a dark brown.Fig. 164_b_ (No. 89858 [1319], from Utkiavwĭñ), is a similar box, 21.1inches long. The cover is held on by a string passing over littlehooked ivory studs close to the edge of the box. There were originallyfive of these studs, two at each end and one in the middle of oneside. The string started from one of these studs at the pointed end.This stud is broken and the string fastened into a hole close to it.To fasten on the cover the string was carried over and hooked underthe opposite stud, then crossed over the cover to the middle stud,then across to the end stud on the other side, and the loop on the endhooked onto the last stud.  [Illustration: FIG. 165.--Large wooden tool boxes. 1/8]No. 89859 [1318] is a smaller box (19 inches long) of the samepattern, with only four studs. The cover has three large blue glassbeads, like those used for labrets, inlaid in a line along the middle.No. 89858 [1144], from Utkiavwĭñ, is the shape of the type, but has athicker cover and six stud holes in the margin. No. 89861 [1151], Fig.165_a_, from the same place, is shaped something like a violin case,22.2 inches long. The cover has been split and “stitched” togetherwith whalebone, and a crack in the broader end of the box has beenneatly mended by pegging on, with nine little wooden treenails,a strap of reindeer antler of the same width as the edge and followingthe curve of its outline. There are four studs, two at each end. Thestring is made fast to one at the smaller end, carried over to theopposite one, then crossed to the opposite stud at the other end andback under the last one, a bight of the end being tucked under thestring between the two last-mentioned studs. The string is made ofsinew braid, rope-yarns, and a long piece of seal thong. It wasprobably at first all of sinew braid, and, gradually growing too shortby being broken and knotted together again, was lengthened out withwhatever came to hand.No. 89862 [1593], Fig. 165_b_, is a large box, of a very peculiarshape, best understood from the figure. The outside is much weathered,but appears to have been roughly carved, and the excavation of the boxand cover is very rudely done, perhaps with a stone tool. A hole inthe larger end is mended by a patch of wood chamfered off to fit thehole and sewed on round the edges with “over-and-over” stitches ofwhalebone. The string is arranged in permanent loops, under which thecover can be slipped off and on.  [Illustration: FIG. 166.--Tool bag of wolverine skin. 1/4]The arrangement, which is rather complicated, is as follows: On oneside of the box, one-half inch from the edge and about 7 inches fromeach end, are two pairs of holes, one-half inch apart. Into each pairis fastened, by means of knots on the inside, a loop of very stoutsinew braid, 3 inches long, and similar loops of seal thong, 5 incheslong, are fastened into corresponding pairs of holes on the otherside. A piece of seal thong is fastened with a becket-hitch into theloop of seal thong at the small end of the box, passes through bothbraid loops on the other side, and is carried over through the loop ofseal thong at the large end. The end of the thong is knotted into oneof the pairs of holes left by the breaking away of a stitch at theedge of the wooden patch above mentioned.All these boxes are very old and were painted inside with red ocher,which has turned dark brown from age. Tools are nowadays kept in alarge oblong, flat satchel, ĭkqûxbwĭñ, which has an arched handle ofivory or bone stretched lengthwise across the open mouth. These bagsare always made of skin with the hair out, and the skins ofwolverines’ heads are the most desired for this purpose. Thecollection contains four such bags. No. 89794 [1018], Fig. 166, is thetype of these bags. The bottom of the bag is a piece of short-hairedbrown deerskin, with the hair out, pieced across the middle. The sidesand ends are made of the skins of four wolverine heads, without thelower jaw, cut off at the nape and spread out and sewed together sideby side with the hair outward and noses up. One head comes on each endof the bag and one on each side, and the spaces between the noses arefilled out with gussets of deerskin and wolverine skin. A narrow stripof the latter is sewed round the mouth of the bag. The handle is ofwalrus ivory, 14½ inches long and about one-half inch square. There isa vertical hole through it one-half inch from each end, and at one endalso a transverse hole between this and the tip. One end of the thongwhich fastens the handle to the bag is drawn through this hole and cutoff close to the surface. The other end is brought over the handle anddown through the vertical hole and made fast with two half-hitchesinto a hole through the septum of the nose of the head at one end ofthe bag. The other end of the handle is fastened to the opposite nosein the same way, but the thong is secured in the hole by a simple knotin the end above. On one side of the handle is an unfinished incisedpattern.  [Illustration: FIG. 167.--Tool bag of wolverine skin. 1/4]Fig. 167, No. 89776 [1004], is a similar bag, made of four wolverineheads with the lower jaws attached. The bottom is of stout leatherwithout hair. The mouth is tied up by a bit of thong passed throughthe nostrils of the two side heads so that it can spread open onlyabout 1¾ inches. The handle is broad and flat, made of walrus ivory,and ornamented with an incised border on top. One end is broken andpieced out with reindeer antler secured by a clumsy “fishing” of sealtwine, which is passed through holes in the two parts. The pieces seemto have been riveted together as in the drill bow, No. 89777 [1004_b_](Fig. 154), which belongs to this bag. There is a rivet still stickingin the antler. It is possible that the ivory may have broken in theprocess of riveting the two together. The handle has two verticalholes at each end for the thong, by which it is fastened to the endnoses, both in the median line and joined by a short channel on top ofthe handle. This bag was the property of the Nunatañmiun Ilûbw’ga, sofrequently mentioned, and was purchased with all its contents.  [Illustration: _a_ _b_ FIG. 168.--Drills belonging to the tool bag.  1/3]These are two bow drills, one large and one small (Figs. 168_a_ and168_b_, Nos. 89778 and 89779 [1004_a_]); a drill bow (Fig. 154, No.89777 [1004_b_]); a mouthpiece (Fig. 155, No. 89787 [1004_c_]); alarge crooked knife with a sheath (Fig. 114, No. 89780 [1004_d_]); aflint flaker (No. 89752 [1004_e_]); a comb for deerskins (Fig. 169,No. 89781 [1005]); a haircomb made of antler (No. 89785 [1006]);a fishhook (No. 89783 [1007]); and a small seal harpoon head(No. 89784 [1008]).  [Illustration: FIG. 169.--Comb for deerskins in the tool bag. 1/2]No. 89796 [1118], from Nuwŭk, is of rather unusual materials. Thebottom is of brown reindeer skin and the sides and ends are the headsof two wolves and a red fox. The wolf heads meet on one side, and thefox head is put in between them on the other. The fox head has nolower jaw, and one wolf head has only the left half of the lower jaw.The vacant spaces around the mouth are filled by triangular gussets ofwolf and reindeer skin. The eyeholes are patched on the inside withdeerskin. It has no handle. No. 89795 [1309], the remaining bag, is ofthe usual pattern, but carelessly made of small pieces of deerskin,with a handle of coarse-grained whale’s bone. It was probably made forsale.I have figured four handles of such bags to show the style ofornamentation. Fig. 170_a_(No. 89420 [1111], from Nuwŭk) has incisedfigures of men and reindeer on the back, once colored with ocher, ofwhich traces can still be seen. This is perhaps a hunting score. (Seeremarks on this subject under “Bow drills.”) Fig. 170_b_ (No. 89423[996], from Utkiavwĭñ) is a very elaborate handle, with scallopededges and fluted back, which is also ornamented with an incisedpattern colored with red ocher. The other side is covered with seriesof the incised circles, each with a dot in the center, so frequentlymentioned. Fig. 170_c_ (No. 89424 [890], from Nuwŭk) has on the underside two rows of figures representing the flukes and “smalls” ofwhales. This is the specimen already mentioned, which the nativescalled an actual score. The series of twenty-six tails were said to bethe record of old Yûksĭ´ña (“Erksinra” of Dr. Simpson), the so-called“chief” at Nuwŭk. All the above handles are of walrus ivory, and havebeen in actual use. Fig. 170_c_ (No. 56513 [43], from Utkiavwĭñ) is ahandle of different material (reindeer antler) and of somewhatdifferent pattern. One end is neatly carved into an exceedinglyaccurate image of the head of a reindeer which has shed its antlers,with small blue beads inlaid for the eyes. The back of the handle isornamented with an incised pattern colored with red ocher. We weretold that such handles were sometimes fitted to the wooden buckets,but I never saw one so used.  [Illustration: FIG. 170.--Bag handles.]  [Illustration: FIG. 171.--Bag of leather.]No. 89798 [1075], Fig. 171, is a bag of rather unusual pattern, theonly one of the kind we saw. The bottom is a single round piece,9 inches in diameter, of what seems to be split skin of the beardedseal, flesh side out, and the rest of the bag is of white-tanned sealleather. The sides are of five broad pieces (6, 4½, 4, 5½, and 5inches broad at the bottom, respectively, narrowing to 2½, 1½, 1¼, 2,and 2⅓, respectively, at the top), alternating with five straightstrips, respectively 1½, 1, 1⅓, 1¼, and 1½ inches broad. The edges ofthese strips overlap the edges of the broad pieces, and are neatlystitched with two threads, as on the soles of the waterproof boots.The outer thread, which is caught in the loop of each stitch of theother, is a slender filament of black whale-bone. This produces a sortof embroidery. The neck is stitched to the bag with the same seam, butthe hem at the mouth is merely “run” round with sinew. This bag wasprobably for holding small tools and similar articles.WEAPONS.As would naturally be expected from what has been said of the peacefulcharacter of these people, offensive weapons, specially intended foruse against men, are exceedingly rare. In case of quarrels betweenindividuals or parties the bows, spears, and knives intended forhunting or general use would be turned against their enemies. Eventheir rifles, nowadays, are kept much more for hunting than as weaponsof offense, and the revolvers of various patterns which many of themhave obtained from the ships are chiefly carried when traveling backand forth between the two villages as a protection against a possiblebear. We, however, obtained a few weapons which were especiallydesigned for taking human life. One of these was a little club(tĭ´glun) (No. 89492 [1310], Fig. 172, from Utkiavwĭñ) made of thebutt end of an old pickax head of whale’s bone, with the point cutdown to a blunt end. It is 6.4 inches long and meant to be clenched inthe hand like a dagger, and used for striking blows, probably at thetemple. The transverse grooves for hafting give a good hold for thefingers. This was the only weapon of the kind seen.  [Illustration: FIG. 172.--Little hand-club. 1/2]We collected a single specimen of a kind of slung shot, No. 89472[905] (Fig. 173), made of a roughly ovoid lump of heavy bone, thesymphysis of the lower jaw of a walrus, 3⅓ inches long. At the smallerend two large holes are bored in obliquely so as to meet under thesurface and form a channel through which is passed a slip of whiteseal skin about 15 inches long, the ends of which fasten together withtwo slits, so as to make a loop. This may be compared with the stoneballs used by the ancient Aleuts for striking a man on the temple.  [Illustration: FIG. 173.--Slungshot made of walrus jaw. 1/2]The commonest weapon of offense was a broad dagger made of a bone ofthe polar bear. This was said to be especially meant for killing a“bad man,” possibly for certain specified offenses or perhaps in casesof insanity. Insane persons were sometimes killed in Greenland, andthe act was considered “neither decidedly admissible nor altogetherunlawful.”[N288] The use of bears’ bones for these weapons points tosome superstitious idea, perhaps having reference to the ferocity ofthe animal. We collected five specimens of these daggers, of which No.89484 [767], Fig. 174, has been selected as the type. It is the distalend of the ulna of a polar bear, with the neck and condyles formingthe hilt, and the shaft split so as to expose the medullary cavity andcut into a pointed blade. It is very old, blackened, and crumbling onthe surface, and is a foot long.    [Footnote N288: Rink, Tales and Traditions, p. 35.]Fig. 175_a_, No. 89475 [988], from Nuwŭk, is made of a straightsplinter from the shaft of one of the long bones, 9¾ inches long. No.89480 [1141], from Utkiavwĭñ, has a roughly whittled hilt and asomewhat twisted blade, rather narrow, but widened to a sharplanceolate point. It is 12 inches long. No. 89481 [1175], from thesame place, has the roughly shaped hilt whipped with two turns ofsinew. No. 89482 [1709], Fig. 175_b_, also from Utkiavwĭñ, isdirk-shaped, having but one edge and a straight back. The hilt, asbefore, is roughly sawed from the solid head of the bone. No. 89485[965], Fig. 176, from Nuwŭk, was also said to be a dagger, but couldnot have been a very effective weapon. It is of whale’s bone, 5 incheslong. It is rather rudely carved, old, and dirty, but the notches onthe haft are newly cut.  [Illustration: FIG. 174.--Dagger of bear’s bone.]  [Illustration: FIG. 175.--Bone daggers.]Dirks or daggers of bear’s bone, like those described, are reallyrather formidable weapons, as it is easy to give the splinter of bonea very keen point. The Museum contains a bone dagger curiously likethese Eskimo weapons, but made of the bone of the grizzly bear, andused by the Indians of the McCloud River, northern California. Theybelieve that the peculiar shape of the point, having a hollow (themedullary cavity) on one face, like the Eskimo daggers, causes thewound to bleed internally.PROJECTILE WEAPONS._Firearms._--When Dease and Simpson first met these people, in 1837,they had no firearms, but the next party of whites who came in contactwith them (Pullen and Hooper, in 1849) found the “chief” in possessionof an old shaky musket of English make, with the name “Barnett” on thelock.[N289] Hooper believed this to be the gun lost by Sir JohnFranklin’s party in 1826.[N290] This gun was, however, often seen bythe people of the _Plover_ (in fact, Capt. Maguire kept it on board ofthe _Plover_ for some time[N291]), and was found to have on the lock,besides the name “Barnett,” also the date, “1843,” so that of courseit was not lost in 1826. Armstrong[N292] also mentions seeing thisgun, which, the natives told him, they had procured “from the othertribes to the southward.” In the summer of 1853 they began to purchaseguns and ammunition from the eastern natives. Yûksĭña and two othermen each bought a gun this year.[N293]    [Footnote N289: Hooper, Tents, etc., p. 239.]    [Footnote N290: Franklin, 2d Exp., p. 148. In the hurry of leaving    Barter Island “one of the crew of the _Reliance_ left his gun and    ammunition.”]    [Footnote N291: See McClure’s N. W. Passage, p. 390.]    [Footnote N292: Narrative, p. 109.]    [Footnote N293: Maguire, Further Papers, p. 907.]  [Illustration: FIG. 176.--So-called dagger of bone. 1/2]As the whalers began to go to Point Barrow in 1854, the opportunityfor obtaining firearms has been afforded the natives every year sincethen, so that they are now well supplied with guns, chiefly ofAmerican manufacture. That all their firearms have not been obtainedfrom this source is probable from the fact they have still in theirpossession a number of smoothbore percussion guns, double and singlebarreled, of Russian manufacture. They are all stamped in Russian withthe name of Tula, a town on the Oopa, 105 miles south of Moscow, whichhas received the name of the “Sheffield and Birmingham of Russia,”from its vast manufactory of arms, established by Peter the Great.These guns must have come from the “Nunatañmiun,” who obtained themeither from the Siberian traders or from the Russians at Norton Soundthrough the Malemiut. Both smoothbore and rifled guns are in generaluse. The smoothbores are of all sorts and descriptions, from an oldflintlock musket to more or less valuable single and double percussionfowling-pieces. Three of the natives now (1883) have cheap doublebreechloaders and one a single breechloader (made by John P. Lovell,of Boston). Guns in general are called “cupûñ,” an onomatopœic word ingeneral use in western America, but many of the different kinds havespecial names. For instance, a double gun is called madro´lĭñ (from_madro_, _two_). The rifles are also of many different patterns. Thekind preferred by the natives is the ordinary Winchester brass-mounted15-shot repeater, which the whalers and traders purchase cheaply atwholesale. This is called akĭmiɐlĭñ (“that which has fifteen,” sc.,shots). The whalers are also in the habit of buying up all sorts ofcheap or second-hand guns for the Arctic trade, so that many otherkinds of guns are also common. Of breechloaders, we saw the Sharpe’srifle, savĭgro´lĭñ (from a fancied resemblance between the crookedlever of this gun and the crooked knife, savigro´n); other patterns ofWinchester; the Spencer repeater, kai´psualĭñ (from kaipsĭ,cartridge); the peculiar Sharps-Hankins, once used in the U.S. Navy,and which was the favorite weapon of the rebel Boers in South Africa;the Peabody-Martini, made in America for the Turkish Government,marked on the rear sight with Turkish figures, and, exposed with acorpse at the cemetery, one English Snider. The regulation Springfieldrifles belonging to the post, which were often loaned to the nativesfor the purpose of hunting, were called mûkpara´lĭñ (from _mûkpara´_,book, referring to the breech action, which opens like a book).They formerly had very few muzzle-loading rifles, but of late years,since the law against trading arms to the natives has been construedto refer solely to breech-loading rifles, the whalers have sold themyäger rifles, of the old U.S. Army pattern, Enfield rifles, ship’smuskets with the Tower mark on them, and a sort of bogus rifle madeespecially for trade, in imitation of the old-fashioned Kentuckyrifle, but with grooves extending only a short distance from themuzzle. They of course depend on the ships for their supplies ofammunition, though the Nunatañmiun sometimes bring a few cartridgessmuggled across from Siberia. They naturally are most desirous toprocure cartridges for the rim-fire Winchester guns, as these are notintended to be used more than once. They have, however, invented amethod of priming these rim-fire shells so that they can be reloaded.A common “G. D.” percussion cap is neatly fitted into the rim of theshell by cutting the sides into strips which are folded into slits inthe shell, a little hole being drilled under the center of the cap toallow the flash to reach the powder. This is a very laborious process,but enables the natives to use a rifle which would otherwise beuseless. Such cartridges reloaded with powder and home-madebullets--they have many bullet molds and know how to use them--aretolerably effective. Great care must be taken to insert the cartridgeright side up, so that the cap shall be struck by the firing pin,which interferes with using the gun as a repeater.They are very careless with their rifles, allowing them to get rusty,and otherwise misusing them, especially by firing small shot from themin the duck-shooting season. As a rule they are very fair shots withthe rifle, but extremely lavish of ammunition when they have a supply.The only economy is shown in reloading cartridges and in loading theirshotguns, into which they seldom put a sufficient charge. In spite ofthis some of them shoot very well with the shotgun, though many ofthem show great stupidity in judging distance, firing light charges ofshot at short rifle range (100 to 200 yards). Though they mold theirown bullets, I have never known any of them to attempt making shot orslugs. This, which they call kăkrúra (little bullets, from kă´kru,originally meaning _arrow_ and now used for _bullet_ as well) isalways obtained from the whites. The gun is habitually carried in acase or holster long enough to cover the whole gun, made of sealskin,either black-tanned or with the hair on the outside. This, like thebow case, from which it is evidently copied, is slung across the backby a thong passing round the shoulders and across the chest. This isthe method universally practiced for carrying burdens of all sorts.The butt of the gun is on the right side, so that it can be easilyslipped out of the holster under the right arm without unslinging it.Revolvers are also carried slung in holsters on the back in the sameway. Ammunition is carried in a pouch slung over the shoulder. Theyare careless in handling firearms and ammunition. We knew two men whoshot off the tip of the forefinger while filing cartridges which hadfailed to explode in the gun._Whaling guns._--In addition to the kinds of firearms for land huntingabove described a number of the natives have procured from thewhalemen, either by purchase or from wrecks, whaling guns, such as areused by the American whalers, in place of the steel lance fordispatching the whale after it is harpooned. These are of variouspatterns, both muzzle and breech loading, and they are able to procurenearly every year a small supply of the explosive lances to be shotfrom them. They use them as the white men do for killing harpoonedwhales, and also, when the leads of open water are narrow, forshooting them as they pass close to the edge of the ice._Bows_ (_pízĭ´ksĕ_).--In former times the bow was the only projectileweapon which these people possessed that could be used at a longerrange than the “dart” of a harpoon. It was accordingly used forhunting the bear, the wolf, and the reindeer, for shooting birds, andin case of necessity, for warfare. It is worthy of note, in thisconnection, as showing that the use of the bow for fighting was only asecondary consideration, that none of their arrows are regular “wararrows” like those made by the Sioux or other Indians; that is, arrowsto be shot with the breadth of the head horizontal, so as to passbetween the horizontal ribs of a man. Firearms have now almostcompletely superseded the bow for actual work, though a few men, toopoor to obtain guns, still use them.Every boy has a bow for a plaything, with which he shoots small birdsand practices at marks. Very few boys, however, show any great skillwith it. We never had an opportunity of seeing an adult shoot with thebow and arrow; but they have not yet lost the art of bow-making. Thenewest boys’ bows are as skillfully and ingeniously constructed as theold bows, but are of course smaller and weaker. The bow in use amongthese people was the universal sinew-backed bow of the Eskimo carriedto its highest degree of efficiency.[N294] It was of what I havecalled the “Arctic type,” namely, a rather short bow of spruce, from43 to 52 inches in length, nearly elliptical in section, but flatteron the back than on the belly, and slightly narrowed and thickened atthe handle. The greatest breadth was usually about 1¼ inches and thethickness at the handle about three-fourths of an inch. The ends wereoften bent up as in the Tatar bow, and were sometimes separate piecesmortised on. Strength and elasticity was given to the brittle spruceby applying a number of strands of sinew to the back of the bow insuch a way that drawing the bowstring stretched all these elasticcords, thus adding their elasticity to that of the wood. This backingwas always a continuous piece of a three-ply braid of sinew, about thesize of stout pack thread, and on a large bow often 40 or 50 yardslong. It began, as on all Eskimo bows which I have been able toexamine (except those from St. Lawrence Island and the mainland ofSiberia--my “western type”), with an eye at one end of the cord loopedover one nock of the bow, usually the upper. The cord was then laid onthe back of the bow in long strands running up and down and round thenocks, as usual on the other types of bow, but after putting on anumber of these, began running backward and forward between the bends(if the bow was of the Tatar shape), or between corresponding pointson a straight bow, where they were fastened with complicated hitchesaround the bow in such a way that the shortest strands came to the topof the backing, which was thus made to grow thicker gradually towardthe middle of the bow, where the greatest strength and elasticity wereneeded. When enough strands had been laid on they were divided intotwo equal parcels and twisted from the middle into two tight cables,thus greatly increasing the tension to be overcome in drawing the bow.These cables being secured to the handle of the bow, the end of thecord was used to seize the whole securely to the bow.    [Footnote N294: See the writer’s paper on the subject of Eskimo    bows in the Smithsonian Report for 1884, Part II, pp. 307-316.]  [Illustration: FIG. 177.--Boy’s bow from Utkiavwĭñ. 1/8]This seizing and the hitches already mentioned served to incorporatethe backing very thoroughly with the bow, thus equalizing the strainand preventing the bow from cracking. This made a very stiff andpowerful bow, capable of sending an arrow with great force. We weretold by a reliable native that a stone-headed arrow was often drivenby one of these bows wholly through a polar bear, “if there was nobone.” Three bows only were obtained: One from Nuwŭk, one fromUtkiavwĭñ (a lad’s bow), and one from Sidaru.  [Illustration: FIG. 179.--Large bow from Nuwŭk. 1/8]The bow from Utkiavwĭñ, No. 89904 [786] (Fig. 177), though small, isin some respects nearer the type than the other two, and has beenselected for description. The body of the bow is a single piece of theheart of a log of spruce driftwood 36¼ inches long, elliptical insection, flattened more on the back than on the belly. It is taperedto the nocks, which are small club-shaped knobs, and narrowed andthickened at the handle. The backing is of round three-ply braid ofsinew in one continuous piece. The string is a round four-ply braidwith a loop at each end, made by tying a single knot in the standingpart, passing the end through this and taking a half hitch with itround the standing part (Fig. 178). The upper loop is a little thelarger.  [Illustration: FIG. 178.--Loop at end of bowstring. 1/2]No. 89245 [25] (Fig. 179), from Nuwŭk, is a full-sized man’s bow,which is old and has been long in use. It is of the same material, andis 47.3 inches long. Its greatest breadth is 1⅓ inches, and it is 0.8inch thick at the handle. It is slightly narrowed and thinned off fromthe broadest part to about 6 inches from each tip, and is thengradually thickened to the nocks and bent up so that the ends make anangle of about 45° with the bow when unstrung. The ends are separatepieces fitted on at the bends. The ends of the body are chamfered offlaterally to a wedge which fits into a corresponding notch in the endpiece, making a scarf 3¼ inches long, which is strengthened by acurved strap of antler, convex above and thickest in the middle,fitting into the bend on the back. The joint is held together whollyby the backing.We never saw bows of this pattern made and consequently did not learnhow the bending was accomplished. The method is probably the same asthat seen by Capt. Beechey in 1826, at Kotzebue Sound (Voyage,p. 575). The bow was wrapped in wet shavings and held over the fire,and then pegged down on the ground (probably on one side), into shape.A strip of rawhide (the split skin of the bearded seal, with the grainside out), 1 inch wide, runs along the back from bend to bend underthe backing. The chief peculiarity of this bow is the third cable,above the other two, and the great and apparently unnecessarycomplication of the hitches.No. 72771 [234], from Sidaru (Fig. 180_a_ and _b_), is a bow with bentends like the last, but all in one piece and smaller. Its length is43½ inches and its greatest breadth 1⅓. The backing has only twocables, and its chief peculiarity is in having the loose end of thelast strand twisted into one of the cables, while the seizing, of thesame pattern as in the last bow, is made of a separate piece. Theworkmanship of this bow is particularly neat, and it is furtherstrengthened with strips of rawhide (the skin of the bearded seal,split), under the backing. The method of making the string is veryingenious. It appears to have been made on the bow, as follows: Havingthe bow sprung back one end of a long piece of sinew twine was madefast temporarily to the upper nock, leaving an end long enough tofinish off the bowstring. The other end was carried round the lowernock and the returning strand half-hitched round the first snugly upto the nock, and then carried round the upper nock and back again.This was repeated, each strand being half-hitched round all thepreceding at the lower nock until there were eight parallel strands,and an eye fitted snugly to the lower nock. The bight was then slippedoff the upper nock, the end untied and the whole twisted tight. Thistwisted string is now about 2 inches too long, so the upper eye ismade by doubling over 2 inches of the end and stopping it down withthe free end mentioned above, thus making a long eye of seven strands.With the end, six similar strands are added to the eye, each beingstopped to the twist with a half hitch. The end is neatly tucked inand the strands of the eye twisted tightly together.  [Illustration: FIG. 180.--Large bow from Sidaru. 1/8]In my paper on Eskimo bows, already mentioned, I came to theconclusion that the bows formerly used by the Eskimo of western NorthAmerica and the opposite coast of Asia were constructed upon threewell defined types of definite geographical distribution, and eacheasily recognized as a development of a simple original type still tobe found in Baffin Land in a slightly modified form. These three typesare:I. The Southern type, which was the only form used from the island ofKadiak to Cape Romanzoff, and continued in frequent use as far asNorton Sound, though separated by no hard and fast line fromII. The Arctic type, to which the bows just described belong, in usefrom the Kaviak peninsula to the Mackenzie and Anderson rivers; andIII. The Western type, confined to St. Lawrence Island and themainland of Siberia.I have shown how these three types differ from each other and from theoriginal type, and have expressed the opinion that these differencesresult from the different resources at the command of the people ofdifferent regions. I have also endeavored to account for the fact thatwe find sporadic examples of the Arctic type, for instance as farsouth as the Yukon, by the well known habits of the Eskimo in regardto trading expeditions.Outside of the region treated in my paper above referred to, there isvery little material for a comparative study of Eskimo bows, either inthe Museum or in the writings of travelers. Most writers havecontented themselves with a casual reference to some of the moresalient peculiarities of the weapon without giving any detailedinformation. Beginning at the extreme north of Greenland, we find thatthe so-called “Arctic Highlanders” have hardly any knowledge of thebow. Dr. Kane saw none during his intercourse with them, but Dr.Bessels[N295] mentions seeing one bow, made of pieces of antlerspliced together, in the possession of a man at Ita. In DanishGreenland, the use of the bow has been abandoned for many years. WhenCrantz[N296] wrote it had already gone out of use, though inEgede’s[N297] time it was still employed. It appears to have beenlonger than the other Eskimo bows. Nordenskiöld[N298] reproduces apicture of a group of Greenlanders from an old painting of the date of1654 in the Ethnographical Museum of Copenhagen. The man holds in hisleft hand a straight bow, which appears to have the backing reachingonly part way to the ends like a western bow without the end cables,and yet twisted into two cables. If this representation be a correctone, this arrangement of the backing, taken in connection with whatCrantz and Egede say of the great length of the bow, would be anargument in favor of my theory that the St. Lawrence Island bow wasdeveloped from the primitive form by lengthening the ends of the bowwithout lengthening the backing. The addition of the end cables wouldthen be an after invention, peculiar to the western bow. In BaffinLand the bow is very rudely made, and approaches very closely to mysupposed primitive form. Owing to the scarcity of wood in this regionthe bow was frequently made of reindeer antler, a substance still moreunsuitable for the purpose than the soft coniferous woods usedelsewhere. There are in the Museum three specimens of such antlerbows, brought from Cumberland Gulf by Mr. Kumlien.    [Footnote N295: Naturalist, vol 8, No. 9, p. 869.]    [Footnote N296: “In former times they made use of bows for land    game; they were made of soft fir, a fathom in length, and to make    it the stiffer it was bound round with whalebone or sinews.”    History of Greenland, vol. 1, p. 146.]    [Footnote N297: “Their Bow is of an ordinary Make, commonly made    of Fir Tree, . . . and on the Back strengthened with Strings made    of Sinews of Animals, twisted like Thread.” “The Bow is a good    fathom long.” Greenland, p. 101.]    [Footnote N298: Voyage of the Vega, vol. 1, p. 41.]The first mention of the Eskimo bow with sinew backing will be foundin Frobisher’s account of his visit to Meta Incognita in 1577:[N299]“Their bowes are of wood of a yard long, sinewed on the back withstrong sinewes, not glued too, but fast girded and tyed on. Their bowestrings are likewise sinewes.”    [Footnote N299: Hakluyt’s Voyages, 1589, p. 628.]Of the bow used at the straits of Fury and Hecla we have a mostexcellent figure in Parry’s Second Voyage (Pl. opposite p. 550,Fig. 22), and the most accurate description to be found in any author.It is, in fact, as exact a description as could be made from anexternal examination of the bow. From the figure the bow appears tohave been almost of the arctic type, having an unusual number ofstrands (sometimes sixty, p. 511) which are not, however, twisted, butsecured with a spiral wrapping, as on southern bows. The backing isstopped to the handle, but not otherwise seized. It appears to havebeen rather a large bow, as Parry gives the length of one of theirbest bows, made of a single piece of fir, as “4 feet 8 inches”(p. 510). “A bow of one piece is, however, very rare; they generallyconsist of from two to five pieces of bone of unequal lengths,fastened together by rivets and treenails” (p. 511). Parry also speaksof the use of wedges for tightening the backing. Schwatka[N300] speaksof the Netyĭlĭk of King Williams Land as using bows of spliced piecesof musk-ox horn or driftwood, but gives no further description ofthem. Ellis[N301] describes the bow in use at Hudson’s Strait in 1746as follows:  Their greatest Ingenuity is shown in the Structure of their Bows,  made commonly of three Pieces of Wood, each making a part of the  same Arch, very nicely and exactly joined together. They are  commonly of Fir or Larch, which the English there call Juniper, and  as this wants Strength and Elasticity, they supply both by bracing  the Back of the Bow with a kind of Thread or Line made of the Sinew  of their Deer, and the Bowstring of the same material. To make them  draw more stiffly, they dip them into Water, which causes both the  Back of the Bow and the String to contract, and consequently gives  it the greater force.[N302]    [Footnote N300: Science, vol. 4, 98, p. 543.]    [Footnote N301: Voyage to Hudson’s Bay, p. 138.]    [Footnote N302: Compare what I have already said about the backing    being put on wet.]Ellis’s figure (plate opposite p. 132) shows a bow of the Tatar shape,but gives no details of the backing, except that the latter appears tobe twisted.We have no published descriptions of the bows used in other regions.As far as I have been able to ascertain, the practice of backing thebow with cords of sinew is peculiar to the Eskimo, though someAmerican Indians stiffen the bow by gluing flat pieces of sinew uponthe back.One tribe of Indians, the “Loucheux” of the Mackenzie district,however, used bows like those of the Eskimos, but Sir AlexanderMackenzie[N303] expressly states that these were obtained from theEskimo.    [Footnote N303: Voyages from Montreal . . . to the Frozen and    Pacific Oceans, p. 48.]_Arrows._--With these bows were used arrows of various patternsadapted for different kinds of game. There are in the collectionfifty-one arrows, which are all about the same length, 25 to 30inches. In describing these arrows I shall employ the terms used inmodern archery[N304] for the parts of the arrow. The greatestvariation is in the shape and size of the pile. The stele is almostalways a straight cylindrical rod, almost invariably 0.4 inch indiameter, and ranging in length from 20 to 28 inches. Twenty-fiveinches is the commonest length, and the short steles, when notintended for a boy’s bow, are generally fitted with an unusually longpile. From the beginning of the feathering the stele is graduallyflattened above and below to the nock, which is a simple notch almostalways 0.2 inch wide and of the same depth. The stele is sometimesslightly widened just in front of the nock to give a better hold forthe fingers. The feathering is 6 or 7 inches long, consisting of two,or less often, three feathers. (The set of sixteen arrows from Sidaru,two from Nuwŭk, and one from Utkiavwĭñ, have three feathers. The restof the fifty-one have two.) The shaft of the feather is split and theweb is cut narrow, and tapered off to a point at each end (Fig. 181).The ends of the feathers are fastened to the stele with whippings offine sinew, the small end of the feather which, of course, comes atthe nock, being often wedged into a slit in the wood (with a specialtool to be described below), or else doubled back over a few turns ofthe whipping and lashed down with the rest. The small end of thefeather is almost always twisted about one turn, evidently to make thearrow revolve in flight, like a rifle ball. Generally, if notuniversally, the feathering was made of the feathers of some bird ofprey, falcon, eagle, or raven, probably with some notion of giving tothe arrow the death-dealing quality of the bird. Out of the fifty-onearrows in the collection, only nine are feathered with gull’sfeathers, and of these all but two are new, or newly feathered forsale to us.[N305] Dr. Simpson[N306] says that in his time “feathersfor arrows and head-dresses,” probably the eagles’ feathers previouslymentioned, were obtained in trade from the “Nunatañmiun.”  [Illustration: FIG. 181.--Feathering of the Eskimo arrow.]Four kinds of arrows were used: the bear arrow, of which there werethree varieties, the deer arrow, the arrow for geese, gulls, and otherlarge fowl, and the blunt headed arrow for killing small birds withoutmangling them.    [Footnote N304: Encyclopedia Britannica, 9th edition, article    Archery.]    [Footnote N305: On this subject of using the feathers of birds of    prey for arrows, compare Crantz, History of Greenland, i, p. 146,    “the arrow . . . winged behind with a couple of raven’s feathers.”    Bessels, Naturalist, vol. 18, pt. 9, p. 869 (the three arrows at    Ita had raven’s feathers). Parry, 2d Voyage, p. 511, “Toward the    opposite end of the arrow are two feathers, generally of the    spotted owl, not very neatly lashed on;” and Kumlien,    Contributions, p. 37, “The feather-vanes were nearly always made    from the primaries of _Strix scandiaca_ or _Graculus carbo_.” The    last is the only mention I find of using any feathers except those    of birds of prey.]    [Footnote N306: Op. cit., p. 266.]_Bear arrows._--These are of three kinds, all having a broad, sharppile, often barbed. The first kind has a pile of flaked flint, calledkūki (“claw” or “nail”), and was known as kukĭ´ksadlĭñ (“provided orfitted with claw material”). Of this kind we have eight completearrows and one shaft.No. 89240 [25], Fig. 182, will serve as the type. The pile is of blackflint, double edged and sharp pointed, 2 inches long, with a shorttang inserted into a cleft in the end of the stele, and secured by awhipping of about fifteen turns of fine sinew. The stele is of spruce,25½ inches long and four-tenths inch in diameter, and painted with redocher from the feathering to 5 inches from the pile. The threefeathers, apparently those of the gyrfalcon, have their ends simplywhipped to the stele. They are 6 inches long. This is one of the twoarrows from Nuwŭk with three feathers.  [Illustration: FIG. 182.--Flint-headed arrow (kukĭksadlĭñ). 1/8]  [Illustration: FIG. 183.--Long flint pile.]No. 72780 [234_a_], from Sidaru, is feathered with three ravenfeathers, of which the small ends are wedged into slits in the wood.The pile is of brown jasper, long and lancet-tipped, expanding intorounded wings at each side of the base. The stele is peculiar only inbeing slightly widened in front of the nock. It is of pine, 26.8inches long, and painted with two rings, one red and one green, at themiddle of the feathering.  [Illustration: FIG. 184.--Short flint pile.]The only variations of importance in these arrows are in the shape ofthe pile, which is made of black or gray flint, or less often ofjasper, mostly variegated, brown and gray. There are four patterns tobe found in the series of eight arrows and twenty-two stone piles. Thefirst is long and narrow, like No. 56704 [232], Fig. 183, fromUtkiavwĭñ, which is of gray flint. The next is similar in shape, butshorter, as shown in Fig. 182 (No. 89240 [25], from Nuwŭk), which isonly 2 inches long, exclusive of the tang. The third pattern, which isless common than the others, is about the size of the last, butrhomboidal in shape (Fig. 184, No. 56691_c_ [64_c_], from Utkiavwĭñ,of dark grayish brown flint, rather coarsely flaked). The fourth kindis very short, being not over 1½ inches, including the half-inch tang,but is 1 inch broad, thick and convex on both faces. It is triangular,with a square base and curved edges (Fig. 185, No. 56702_b_ [113_b_],from Utkiavwĭñ, newly made for sale).  [Illustration: FIG. 185.--Heart-shaped flint pile.]  [Illustration: FIG. 186.--Arrows: (_a_) Arrow with “after-pile”  (ipudlĭgadlĭñ); (_b_) arrow with iron pile (savidlĭñ); (_c_) arrow  with iron pile (savidlĭñ); (_d_) arrow with copper pile (savidlĭñ);  (_e_) deer-arrow (nûtkodlĭñ).]No stone arrow or dart heads made by these people have anything likebarbs except the square shoulders at the base. They seem never to haveattained to the skill in flint-working which enabled many othersavages to make the beautiful barbed heads so often seen. To keep theflint-headed arrow from dropping out of the wound they hit upon thecontrivance of mounting it not directly in the stele but in a piece ofbone upon which barbs could be cut, or, as is not unlikely, havingalready the deer arrow with the barbed head of antler, they added theflint head to this, thus combining the penetration of the flint arrowwith the holding power of the other. I was at first inclined to thinkthat this piece of bone bore the same relation to the rest of thearrow as the fore shaft of many Indian arrows, and was to beconsidered as part of the stele. Considering, however, that its solefunction is to furnish the pile with barbs, it evidently must beconsidered as part of the latter. I shall designate it as“after-pile.” Arrows with this barbed “after-pile” form the secondkind of bear arrows, which are called ipudlĭ´gadlĭñ (“having theipu´dlĭgɐ” [Gr. ipuligak, the similar bone head of a seal lance withiron tip]). After the introduction of iron, metal piles sometimesreplaced the flint in arrows of this kind. We collected eight withflint and two with metal piles. No. 72787 [234_a_], Fig. 186_a_, hasbeen selected to illustrate this form of arrow. This pile is of grayflint with the tang wedged by a slip of sealskin into the tip of theafter-pile, which is cleft to receive it and kept from splitting by awhipping of sinew. The after-pile is fitted into the tip of the stelewith a rounded sharp-pointed tang, slightly enlarged just above thetip. It is of reindeer antler. The rest of the arrow does not differfrom those previously described. The stele is of pine and is featheredwith three gyrfalcon feathers.Two others from Sidaru have only a single barb on the after-pile, butthe other four have two, one behind the other on the same side. No.89237 [164], from Utkiavwĭñ, differs in no respect from thesingle-barbed flint arrows from Sidaru, but No. 72763 [164], from thesame village, has four small barbs on the after-pile, which isunusually (nearly 7 inches) long, and a pile of sheet brass. This hasthe basal angles on each side cut into three small, sharp,backward-pointing teeth. The total length of this arrow is 28 inches.The after-piles of all arrows except one were of reindeer antler,which is another reason for supposing that this form of arrow is amodification of the deer arrow. After the introduction of iron, thismetal or copper was substituted for the flint pile of thekukĭ´ksadlĭñ, making the third and last form of bear arrow, thesa´vĭdlĭñ (“fitted with iron”). This arrow differs from the othersonly in the form of the pile, which is generally broad and flat, andeither rhomboidal, with the base cut into numerous small teeth, orelse triangular, with a shank. The barbs are usually bilateral.No. 72758 [25], from Nuwŭk, represents the first form. The pile is ofiron, rough and flat, 2½ inches long. No. 72770 [241_b_], fromUtkiavwĭñ, is of the same form. No. 72760 [165], Fig. 186_c_, fromUtkiavwĭñ, has a similar pile 3.3 inches long, but has each of theunder edges cut into four sharp, backward-pointing teeth. No. 72778[234_b_], Fig. 186_d_, has a pile of sheet copper 2.3 inches long, ofthe same shape, but with six teeth. This arrow came from Sidaru. No.72765 [25], from Nuwŭk, is a long, narrow iron pile with threebilateral barbs, all simple.Nos. 72755 [25], from Nuwŭk, 72759 [25], also from Nuwŭk, and 72764[165], from Utkiavwĭñ, show the shanked form. The first is triangular,with a flat shank and a simple barb at each angle of the base. It isof steel (piece of a saw) and 2.8 inches long. The second resemblesNo. 72760 [165], with more teeth, mounted on a slender cylindricalshank 1½ inches long. It is of iron and 3.9 inches long. The third isa long pile with a sinuate outline and one pair of simple bilateralbarbs, and a flat shank one-half inch long. Nos. 72757 [25] (Fig.186b) and 72762 [25], both from Nuwŭk, are peculiar in being the onlyiron-pointed arrows with unilateral barbs. The piles are made of thetwo blades of a pair of large scissors, cut off at the point, withenough of the handle left to make a tang. The unilateral barb is filedout on the back of the blade, which has been beveled down on bothfaces to a sharp edge. All of these broadheaded arrows have thebreadth of the pile at right angles to the plane of the nock, showingthat they are not meant to fly like the Sioux war arrows. Althoughiron makes a better material for arrow piles and is more easily workedthan flint, the quivers which some men still carry at Point Barrowcontain flint as well as iron headed arrows. They are probably kept inuse from the superstitious conservatism already mentioned. It iscertain that the man who raised a couple of wolf cubs for the sake oftheir fur was obliged by tradition to have a flint-headed arrow tokill them with. These arrows, we were informed, were especiallydesigned for hunting “nä´nu,” the polar bear, but of course they alsoserved for use against other dangerous game, like the wolf and brownbear, and there is no reason to believe that they were not also shotat reindeer, though the hunter would naturally use his deer arrowsfirst.  [Illustration: FIG. 187.--Pile of deer arrow (nûtkăñ).]Deer arrows have a long trihedral pile of antler from 4 to 8 incheslong, with a sharp thin-edged point slightly concaved on the faceslike the point of a bayonet. Two of the edges are rounded, but thethird is sharp and cut into one or more simple barbs. Behind the barbthe pile takes the form of a rounded shank, ending in a shoulder and asharp rounded tang a little enlarged above the point.No. 72768 [162], Fig. 186_e_ from Utkiavwĭñ, has a pile 3½ inches longwith two barbs. The pile of No. 89238 [162] from the same village is 3½inches long and has but one barb, while that of No. 89241_a_ [162] is7.8 inches long and has three barbs. The rudely incised figure on theshank of No. 89238 [162] represents a wolf, probably a talisman tomake the arrow as fatal to the deer as the wolf is. No. 56588 [13],Fig. 187, is a pile for one of these arrows slightly peculiar inshape, being elliptical in section, with one edge sharp and two-barbedand a four-sided point. The figure shows well the shape of the tang.The peculiarity of these arrows is that the pile is not fastened tothe shaft, but can easily be detached.[N307] When such an arrow wasshot into a deer the shaft would easily be shaken out, leaving thesharp barbed pile in the wound.    [Footnote N307: Compare the passage in Frobisher’s Second Voyage    (Hakluyt, 1589, p. 628). After describing the different forms of    arrowheads used by the Eskimo of “Meta Incognita” (Baffin Land) in    1577 he says: “They are not made very fast, but lightly tyed to,    or else set in a nocke, that upon small occasion the arrowe    leaveth these heads behind them.”]  [Illustration: FIG. 188.--Kûñmûdlĭñ arrow pile.]The Eskimo told us that a deer wounded in this way would “sleep onceand die,” meaning, apparently, that death would ensue in abouttwenty-four hours, probably from peritonitis. The bone pile is callednû´tkăñ, whence comes the name of the arrow, nû´tko´dlĭñ. We collectedten arrows and three piles of this pattern. No. 89460 [1263], Fig.188, is a peculiar bone arrow pile, perhaps intended for a deer arrow.It is 7 inches long and made of one of the long bones of some largebird, split lengthwise so that it is rounded on one side and deeplyconcave on the other, with two thin rounded edges tapered to a sharppoint. Each edge has three little barbs about the middle of the pile.This was the only arrowhead of the kind seen at Point Barrow, and thenative who sold it said it was a “Kûñmûd´lĭñ” arrow. I was pleased tofind the truth of this corroborated by the Museum collection. Thereare two arrows from the Mackenzie region (Nos. 1106 and 1906) withbone piles of almost the same form.For shooting gulls, geese, and other large fowl they used an arrowwith a straight polygonal pile of walrus ivory, 5 or 6 inches long andabout one-half inch in diameter, terminating in a somewhat obtusepolygonal point, and having one or more unilateral barbs. These pilesare generally five-sided, though sometimes trihedral, and have a long,rounded tang inserted into the end of the shaft. Fig. 189_a_(No. 89349 [119] from Utkiavwĭñ), represents one of these arrows witha five-sided pile 5.5 inches long, with four simple barbs. The rest ofthe arrow does not differ from the others described. No. 89238 [25],from Nuwŭk, has a trihedral pile 6.6 inches long, with a single barb.Another from Nuwŭk (No. 89241 [25]) has a trihedral pile 5.3 incheslong, with two barbs, and one from Utkiavwĭñ (No. 89241 [119]) has afive-sided pile with three barbs. The remaining three, from Sidaru,all have five-sided piles with one barb.Arrows of this pattern are called tuga´lĭñ (from tu´ga, walrus ivory).There are also in the collection two small arrows of this patternsuited for a boy’s bow. They are only 25 inches long, and have roughlytrihedral sharp-pointed ivory piles about 4 inches long, withoutbarbs. (No. 89904_a_ [786] from Utkiavwĭñ). These arrows are new andrather carelessly made, and were intended for the lad’s bow (No. 89904[786]) already described. The three kinds of arrows which have beendescribed all have the pile secured to the stele by a tang fittinginto a cleft or hole in the end of the latter, which is kept fromsplitting by whipping it with sinew for about one-half inch.The fourth kind, the blunt bird arrow (kĭ´xodwain), on the other hand,has the pile cleft to receive the wedge-shaped tip of the stele andsecured by a whipping of sinew. The four arrows of this kind in thecollection are almost exactly alike, except that three of them,belonging to the set from Sidaru, have three feathers. Fig. 189_b_,No. 72773 [234_c_] from Sidaru represents the form of arrow. The pileis of hard bone 2.3 inches long. A little rim at each side of the buttkeeps the whipping of sinew from slipping off. The rest of the arrowdiffers from the others described only in having the end of the stelechamfered down to a wedge-shaped point to fit into the pile.  [Illustration: FIG. 189.--Arrows: (_a_) fowl arrow (tugalĭñ); (_b_)  bird arrow (kixodwain).]This is the kind of arrow mostly used by the boys, whose game isalmost exclusively small birds or lemmings. Nowadays the bone pile isoften replaced by an empty cartridge shell, which makes a very goodhead. I have seen a phalarope transfixed at short range by one ofthese cartridge-headed arrows. An assortment of the different kind ofarrows is usually carried in the quiver. The lot numbered 25, fromNuwŭk, which I believe to be a fairly average set, contains twoflint-headed bear arrows, one barbed bear arrow with a steel pile, sixbear arrows with iron piles, one deer arrow, two fowl arrows, and onebird arrow.As I have already said, all these arrows are flattened above and belowat the nocks. This indicates that they were intended to be held to thestring and let go after the manner of what is called the “Saxonrelease,” namely, by hooking the ends of the index and second fingersround the string and holding the arrow between them, the string beingreleased by straightening the fingers. This is the “release” which weactually saw employed both by the boys and one or two men who showedus how to draw the bow. This method of release has been observed atCumberland Gulf[N308] and at East Cape, Siberia, and is probablyuniversal among the Eskimo, as all the Eskimo arrows in the NationalMuseum are fitted for this release. There is ample material in theMuseum collections for a comparative study of Eskimo arrows, which Ihope some day to be able to undertake, when the material is in a moreavailable condition. One or two references to other regions will not,however, be out of place. The arrow with a barbed bone after-pileseems a very general form, being represented in the Museum from mostof the Alaskan regions, as well as from the Mackenzie. Scoresbymentions finding the head of one of these at the ancient settlementsin east Greenland.[N309] The arrow, however, described by Capt.Parry[N310] has a real foreshaft of bone, not a barbed after pile. Oneof these arrows from the Mackenzie has the after pile barbed on bothsides, the only instance, I believe, in the Museum of abilaterally-barbed Eskimo arrow where the pile is not wholly of metal.    [Footnote N308: “In shooting this weapon the string is placed on    the first joint of the first and second fingers of the right    hand.” (Kumlien, Contributions, p. 37.)    “Beim Spannen wird der Pfeil nicht zwischen Daumen und    Zeigefinger, sondern zwischen Zeige- und Mittelfinger gehalten,”    Krause Brothers, Geographische Blätter, vol. 5, p. 33.]    [Footnote N309: Voyage to the Northern Whale Fishery, p. 187.]    [Footnote N310: 2d Voyage, p. 511, and figured with the bow (22)    on Pl. opposite p. 550.]_Bow cases and quivers._--The bow and arrows were carried in a bowcase and quiver of black sealskin, tied together side by side andslung across the back in the same manner as the gun holster alreadydescribed. We obtained one case and quiver which belong with the bowand arrows (No. 25, from Nuwŭk) and a single quiver with the bow andarrows (No. 234, from Sidaru.) The case, No. 89245 [25], Fig. 190_a_(pizĭ´ksĭzax), is of such a shape that the bow can be carried in itstrung and ready for use. It is made by folding lengthwise a piece ofblack sealskin with the flesh side in and sewing up one side “over andover” from the outside. The bag is wide enough--6 inches at the widestpart--to allow the bow to slip in easily when strung, and the smallend is bent up into the shape of the end of the bow. Along the foldededge are three round holes about 10 inches apart, through which around stick was formerly thrust, coming out from the inside throughthe first hole, in through the second and out through the third again.This served to hold the case in shape when the bow was withdrawn, andto its ends were fastened the thong for slinging it across theshoulders. It was gone from the specimen before we obtained it.  [Illustration: FIG. 190.--Bow case and quivers.]The quiver (No. 89240-1 [25], Fig. 190_b_) is a long, straight bag ofthe same material, open at one end, with a seam down one side, and theedge of the mouth opposite to the seam forming a rounded flap 2 incheslong. The other end is closed by an elliptical cap of white tannedseal skin, turned up about 2 inches all round, and crimped round theends like a boot sole. Its extreme length is 30 inches, and itscircumference 1 foot. Inside along the seam is a roughly rounded rodof wood about ½ inch in diameter, with one end, which is pointed,projecting about 1½ inches through a hole in the bottom, and the otherprojecting about 1 inch beyond the mouth, where it is secured by a bitof thong knotted through a couple of small holes in the bag close tothe edge and passing round a notch on the stick. The stick serves tostiffen the quiver when there are no arrows in it. A bit of thong isknotted round the middle, one end being hitched into a loop on theother, for tightening up the quiver and confining the arrows.The quiver from Sidaru (No. 72788 [234] Fig. 190_c_) is like thepreceding, but larger at the bottom than at the mouth. The latter is8½ inches in circumference and the former 12¾, and the seam is leftopen for about 7½ inches from the mouth to facilitate getting at thearrows. The stiffening rod is made of pine, and does not projectthrough the bottom or reach the edge of the mouth. It is held in bytwo pieces of thong about 10 inches long, which also serve to fastenit to the bow case. This quiver is nearly new.  [Illustration: FIG. 191.--Quiver rod. 1/3]It is probable that the form of the bow case and quiver varied butlittle, among the American Eskimo at least. Those figured by Capt.Lyon[N311] are almost exactly like the ones we collected at PointBarrow, even to the crimped cap on the bottom of the quiver. A similarset belong with a lad’s bow in the Museum from Point Hope (No. 63611).Nordenskiöld, however, figures a very elaborate flat quiver[N312], inuse at Pitlekaj, which is evidently of genuine Asiatic origin.    [Footnote N311: Parry’s 2d Voyage, Pl. opposite p. 550, Fig. 24.]    [Footnote N312: Vega, vol. 2, p. 106.]  [Illustration: FIG. 192.--Cap for quiver rod.]Some pains seem to have been bestowed on ornamenting the quiver informer times, when the bow was in more general use. Fig. 191, No.56505 [231], from Nuwŭk, represents what we understood had been astiffening rod for a quiver or bow case. It is of reindeer antler, 17inches long, and one end is very neatly carved into the head andshoulders of a reindeer, with small, blue glass beads inserted for theeyes. The lanceolate point at the tip was probably made with an ideaof improving it for sale. The hole at the back of the neck is for athong to fasten it on with. A similar reindeer head of antler, Fig.192, No. 89449 [1066], also from Nuwŭk, seems to have been a cap for aquiver stick. The back of the neck makes a half-ferrule, in which arethree holes for rivets or treenails._Bracers._--In shooting the bow, the wrist of the bow hand wasprotected from being chafed by the bowstring by a small shield or“bracer” of bone or horn, strapped on with a thong. We never saw thesein use, as the bow is so seldom employed except by the children. Twoof these, newly made, were offered for sale. I will describe one ofthese, No. 89410_b_ [1233], Fig. 193.  [Illustration: FIG. 193.--Bracer.]It is of pale yellow mountain sheep horn, convex on the outer face andconcave on the inner and considerably arched lengthwise. In the middleare two straight longitudinal narrow slots, which serve no apparentpurpose except ornament. The short slot near the edge at the middle ofeach side, however, is for the thongs which strap the bracer to thewrist. One of these is short and made into a becket by fastening theends together with double slits. One end of the other is passedthrough the slot, slit, and the other end passed through this anddrawn taut. A knot is tied on the free end. This thong is just longenough to fasten on the bracer by passing round the wrist and catchingthe knot in the loop opposite. The other, No. 89410_a_ [1233], is likethis, but 1 inch shorter and nearly flat. The arch of the specimenfigured is probably unintentional and due to the natural shape of thematerial, as it does not fit well to the wrist. It is probable thatthese people used a flat bracer, as Fig. 194, No. 89350 [1382], fromUtkiavwĭñ, is apparently such an implement. It is a thin ellipticalplate of hard bone, 2½ inches long and 1½ wide, with two rows of holescrossing at right angles in the middle. The holes at the side wereprobably for the thong and the others for ornament, as some of them goonly part way through. Four small pebbles are lodged in the four holesaround the center in the form of a cross.  [Illustration: FIG. 194.--Bracer of bone.]Mr. Nelson collected several specimens of bracers from Kotzebue Soundand St. Lawrence Island. These are all slightly larger than ourspecimens, and bent round to fit the wrist. They are of bone orcopper. When Beechey visited Kotzebue Sound, in 1826, he found thebracer in general use.[N313] I find no other mention of this implementin the writers who have described the Eskimo.    [Footnote N313: “They buckle on a piece of ivory, called    _mun-era_, about 3 or 4 inches long, hollowed out to the wrist, or    a guard made of several pieces of ivory or wood fastened together    like an iron-holder.” Voyage, p. 575.]_Bird darts._--For capturing large birds like ducks or geese, sittingon the water, especially when they have molted their wing feathers soas to be unable to escape by flight, they use the universal Eskimoweapon, found from Greenland to Siberia, namely, a dart with one ormore points at the tip, but carrying a second set of three ivoryprongs in a circle round the middle of the shaft. The object of theseprongs is to increase the chance of hitting the bird if he is missedby the head of the dart. They always curve forward, so that the pointsstand out a few inches from the shaft, and are barbed on the inneredge in such a way that, though the neck of a fowl will easily pass inbetween the prong and the shaft, it is impossible to draw it backagain. The weapon is in very general use at Point Barrow, and isalways thrown from the boat with a handboard (to be described below).It can be darted with considerable accuracy 20 or 30 yards. We seldomsaw this spear used, as it is chiefly employed in catching moltingfowl, in the summer season, away from the immediate neighborhood ofthe station. It is called nuiă´kpai, which is a plural referring tothe number of points, one of which is called nuiă´kpûk (“the greatnuiăk”).[N314]    [Footnote N314: This word appears to be a diminutive of the    Greenlandic nuek--nuik, now used only in the plural, nugfit, for    the spear. These changes of name may represent corresponding    changes in the weapon in former times, since, unless we may    suppose that the bird dart was made small and called the “little    nuik,” and enlarged again after the meaning of the name was    forgotten, it is hard to see any sense in the present name, “big    little nuik.”]  [Illustration: FIG. 195.--Bird dart.]No. 89244 [1325], Fig. 195, from Utkiavwĭñ, has been selected as thetype of this weapon. The shaft is of spruce, 61⅓ inches long and 0.7inch in diameter at the head. The end of the butt is hollowed out tofit the catch of the throwing board. The head, of white walrus ivory,is fitted into the cleft end of the shaft with a wedge-shaped tang asbroad as the shaft. The head and shaft are held together by a spacedlashing of braided sinew. To the enlargement of the shaft, 22 inchesfrom the butt, are fastened three curved prongs of walrus ivory atequal distances from each other round the shaft. The inner side ofeach prong is cut away obliquely for about 2 inches, so that when thisedge is applied to the shaft, with the point of the prong forward, thelatter is about 1 inch from the shaft. Each prong has two littleridges on the outside, one at the lower end and the other about 1 inchabove this. They are secured to the shaft by three separate lashingsof sinew braid, two narrow ones above the ridges just mentioned andone broad one just below the barb. In making this the line is knottedround one prong, then carried one-third of the distance round theshaft to the prong; half hitched round this, and carried round nextthe next prong; half hitched round this, and carried round to thestarting point, and half hitched round this. It goes around in thisway seven times, and then is carried one prong farther, half hitchedagain, and the end taken down and made fast to the first narrowlashing. The shaft is painted with red ocher to within 13½ inches (thelength of the throwing board) from the butt. This is an old shaft andhead fitted with new prongs, and was made by Nĭkawa´alu, who wasanxious to borrow it again when getting ready to start on his summertrip to the east, where he would find young ducks and molting fowl.  [Illustration: FIG. 196.--Point for bird dart.]  [Illustration: FIG. 197.--Ancient point for bird dart.]The form of head seen in this dart appears to be the commonest. It iscalled by the same name, nû´tkăñ, as the bone head of the deer arrow.There is considerable variation in the number of barbs, which arealways bilateral, except in one instance, No. 56590 [122], Fig. 196,from Utkiavwĭñ, which has four barbs on one side only. It is 7¼ incheslong exclusive of the tang. Out of eight specimens of such heads onehas one pair of barbs, one two pairs, two three pairs, one fourunilateral barbs, one five pairs, one six pairs, and one seven pairs.The total length of these heads is from 9 inches to 1 foot, of whichthe tang makes about 2 inches, and they are generally made of walrusivory, wherein they differ from the nugfit of the Greenlanders, which,since Crantz’s time[N315] has always had a head of iron. Iron is alsoused at Cumberland Gulf, as shown by the specimens in the NationalMuseum. Fig. 197 represents a very ancient spearhead from Utkiavwĭñ,No. 89372 [760]. It is of compact whale’s bone, darkened with age andimpregnated with oil. It is 8.7 inches long and the other end isbeveled off into a wedge-shaped tang roughened with crosscuts on bothfaces, with a small hole for the end of a lashing as on the head ofNo. 89244 [1325]. This was called by the native who sold it the headof a seal spear, ă´kqlĭgûk, and it does bear some slight resemblanceto the head of weapon used in Greenland and called by a similarname[N316] (agdligaḵ). The roughened tang, however, indicates that itwas intended to be fixed permanently in the shaft, and this, taken inconnection with its strong resemblance to the one-barbed head of theGreenland nugfit[N317] as well as to the head of the Siberian birddart figured by Nordenskiöld[N318], makes it probable that it isreally the form of bird dart head anciently used at Point Barrow. Itis possible that this pattern has been so long out of use that thenatives have forgotten what this old point was made for and supposedit to belong to a seal spear.    [Footnote N315: History of Greenland, vol. 1, p. 148.]    [Footnote N316: Crantz, vol. 1, p. 147, and Figs. 6 and 7, Pl. V.]    [Footnote N317: Ibid., Fig. 8.]    [Footnote N318: Vega, vol. 2, p. 105. Fig. 5.]One of the eight heads of the ordinary pattern in the collection, No.56592 [284], a genuine one, old and dirty, is made of coarse-grainedwhale’s bone, an unusual material. No. 89373 [948], from Utkiavwĭñ, anivory head of a good typical shape, has been figured (Fig. 198) toshow a common style of ornamenting these heads. A narrow incised line,colored with red ocher, runs along the base of the barbs on each sidefor about three-fourths the length of the blade. These heads aresometimes secured by treenails as well as by a simple lashing, as isshown by the holes through the tang of this specimen.  [Illustration: FIG. 198.--Point for bird dart. 1/3]  [Illustration: FIG. 199.--Bird dart with double point. 1/5]An improvement on this style of dart, which appears to be less common,has two prongs at the tip instead of a sharp head, so that the birdmay be caught if struck on the neck with the point of the spear. No.89905 [1326], Fig. 199, from Utkiavwĭñ, is one of this pattern. Thetwo prongs are fastened on with a lashing of fine sinew braid. Therest of the dart does not differ from the one described except in themethod of attaching the three prongs at the middle (Fig. 199_b_).These are fitted into slight grooves in the wood and secured by twoneat lashings of narrow strips of whalebone, one just above a littleridge at the lower end of each prong and one through little holes ineach prong at the top of the oblique edge. Each lashing consists ofseveral turns with the end closely wrapped around them. There is onespecimen, No. 89242 [526], in the collection which not only has notthe prongs at the middle, but lacks the enlargement of the shaft toreceive them. The head is undoubtedly old and genuine, but the shaftand fittings, though dirty, look suspiciously fresh. I am inclined tobelieve that this head was mounted for sale by a man who had no prongsready made, and was in too much of a hurry to get his price to stop tomake them. Imperfect or unfinished objects were frequently offered forsale.The bird darts used at Point Barrow, and by the western Eskimogenerally, are lighter and better finished than those used in theeast. The latter have a heavy shaft, which is four-sided in BaffinLand, and the prongs are crooked and clumsy.[N319]    [Footnote N319: See Crantz’s figure referred to above; also one in    Parry’s second voyage, Pl. opposite p. 550, Fig. 19, and Rink,    Tales., etc., Pl. opposite p. 12.]Fig. 200, No. 89380 [793], is a fragment of a very ancient narwhalivory spearhead, dark brown from age and shiny from much handling,which appears to have been worn as an amulet. It was said to have comefrom the east and to belong to a bird dart, though it does notresemble any in use at the present day in this region. It is a slenderfour-sided rod, having on one side three short oblique equidistantsimple barbs. The resemblance of this specimen to the bone dart headsfrom Scania figured by Dr. Rau[N320] is very striking.  [Illustration: FIG. 200.--Ancient ivory dart head. 1/2]_Seal darts._--The Eskimo of nearly all localities use a dart or smallharpoon to capture the smaller marine animals, with a loose, barbedhead of bone fitted into a socket in the end of the shaft, to which itis attached by a line of greater or less length. It is alwayscontrived so that when the head is struck into the quarry, the shaftis detached from the head and acts as a drag upon the animal. This iseffected by attaching an inflated bladder to the shaft, or else byattaching the line with a martingale so that the shaft is draggedsideways through the water. Nearly all Eskimo except those of PointBarrow, as shown in the National Museum collections and the figures inCrantz[N321] and Rink[N322], use weapons of this kind of considerablesize, adapted not only to the capture of the small seals (_Phocavitulina_ and _P. fœtida_), but also to the pursuit of the largerseals, the narwhal and beluga. At Point Barrow, however, at thepresent day, they employ only a small form of this dart, not over 5feet long, with a little head, adapted only for holding the smallestseals. That they formerly used the larger weapon is shown by ourfinding a single specimen of the head of such a spear, No. 89374[1281] Fig. 201. It is of hard, compact bone, impregnated with oil,8.1 inches long. The flat shank is evidently intended to fit into asocket. The two holes through the widest part of the shank are forattaching the line.    [Footnote N320: Prehistoric fishing, Figs. 94 and 95, p. 73.]    [Footnote N321: History of Greenland, vol. 1, p. 147, Pl. V, Figs.    6 and 7.]    [Footnote N322: Tales, etc., Pl. opposite p. 12 (“bladder    arrow”).]  [Illustration: FIG. 201.--Bone dart head. 1/3]This is very like the head of the weapon called _agligak_ (modernGreenlandic agdligak), figured by Crantz, and referred to above,except that the barbs are opposite each other. Mr. Lucien M. Turnertells me that it is precisely like the head of the dart used at NortonSound for capturing the beluga. The native who sold this specimencalled it “nuiă´kpai nû´tkoa,” “the point of a bird dart,” to which itdoes bear some resemblance, though the shape of the butt and the lineholes indicate plainly that it was a _detachable_ dart head. Probably,as in the case of the ancient bird dart point, No. 89372 [760],referred to above, this weapon has been so long disused that thenatives have forgotten what it was. The name ă´kqlĭgûk, evidently thesame as the Greenlandic _agdligak_, is still in use, but was alwaysapplied to the old bone harpoon heads, which are, however, of thetoggle-head pattern (described below). It seems as if the Point Barrownatives had forgotten all about the ă´kqlĭgûk except that it was aharpoon with a bone head for taking seals. At the present time thesmall bladder float, permanently attached to the shaft of the harpoon,is never used at Point Barrow. That it was used in ancient times isshown by our finding in one of the ruined houses in Utkiavwĭñ a veryold broken nozzle for inflating one of these floats. Fig. 202, No.89720 [756], is this specimen, which was picked up by Capt. Herendeen.This is a rounded tube of fossil ivory, 1.3 inches long and aboutone-half inch in diameter, slightly contracted toward one end and thenexpanded into a stout collar. At the other is a stout longitudinalflange, three-fourths inch long, perforated with an oblong slot.Between the flange and the collar the surface is roughened withcrosscuts, and the other end is still choked with the remains of awooden plug. This nozzle was inserted into a hole in the bladder asfar as the flange and secured by tying the bladder above the collar.The whole was then secured to the shaft by a lashing through the slot,and could be inflated at pleasure and corked up with the wooden plug.  [Illustration: FIG. 202.--Nozzle for bladder float.]  [Illustration: FIG. 203.--Seal dart. 1/12]As I have already said, the only harpoon of this kind now used atPoint Barrow is a small one intended only for the capture of smallseals. It has no bladder, but the rather long line is attached to theshaft by a martingale which makes the shaft drag sideways through thewater. Three of these little darts, which are thrown with a handboardlike the bird dart, make a set. The resistance of the shafts of thesethree spears darted into the seal in succession is said to besufficient to fatigue the seal so that he can be easily approached anddispatched. We never saw these weapons used, though they are verycommon, as they are intended only for use from the kaiak, which thesepeople seldom use in the neighborhood of the villages. When in the_umiak_, shooting with the rifle is a more expeditious means of takingseals. We collected three sets of these darts (kúkigû).No. 89249_b_ [523], Fig. 203, has been selected for description. Theshaft is of spruce, 54½ inches long, and 0.8 inch in diameter at thetip, tapering slightly almost to the butt, which is hollowed on theend to fit the catch of the throwing board. The foreshaft is of whitewalrus ivory 5 inches long, and is fitted into the tip of the shaftwith a wedge-shaped tang. This foreshaft, which has a deep oblong slotto receive the head in the middle of its flat tip, serves the doublepurpose of making a strong solid socket for the head and givingsufficient weight to the end of the dart to make it fly straight. Thehead is a simple flat barbed arrowhead of hard bone 2.3 inches longand one-half inch broad across the barbs, with a flat tang, broadestin the middle, where there is a hole for attaching the line. This headsimply serves to attach the drag of the shaft to the seal as it is toosmall to inflict a serious wound. It is fastened to the shaft by amartingale made as follows: One end of a stout line of sinew braid 5½feet long is passed through the hole in the head and secured by tyinga knot in the end. The other end of this line divides into two partsnot quite so stout, one 3 feet long, the other 2 feet 8 inches. Thelatter is fastened to the shaft 18½ inches from the butt by a singlemarling hitch with the end wedged into a slit in the wood and seizeddown with fine sinew. The longer part serves to fasten the foreshaftto the shaft, and was probably put on separately and worked into thebraiding of the rest of the line at the junction. The foreshaft iskept from slipping out by a little transverse ridge on each side ofthe tang. When the weapon is mounted for use the two parts of thebridle are brought together at the middle of the shaft and wrappedspirally around it till only enough line is left to permit the head tobe inserted in the socket, and the bight of the line is secured bytucking it under the last turn. When a seal is struck with this darthis sudden plunge to escape unships the head. The catch of themartingale immediately slips; the latter unrolls and drags the shaftthrough the water at right angles to the line. The shaft, besidesacting as a drag on the seal’s motions, also serves as a float toindicate his position to the hunter, as its buoyancy brings it to thesurface before the seal when the latter rises for air.The shaft is usually painted red except so much of the end as lies inthe groove of the throwing-board, in the act of darting. These dartsvary but little in size and material, and are all of essentially thesame pattern. They are always about 5 feet in length when mounted foruse. (The longest is 64⅓ inches, and the shortest 57.) The head, aswell as the foreshaft, is sometimes made of walrus ivory, and thelatter sometimes of whale’s bone. The chief variation is in the lengthof the martingale, and the details of the method of attaching it. Notwo are precisely alike. The foreshaft is generally plain, but isoccasionally highly ornamented, as is shown in Fig. 204, No. 56516[105]. The figures are all incised and colored, some with ocher andsome with soot.  [Illustration: FIG. 204.--Foreshaft of seal dart. 1/2]Both of the kinds of darts above described are thrown by means of ahand board or throwing-board. This is a flat, narrow board, from 15 to18 inches long, with a handle at one end and a groove along the uppersurface in which the spear lies with the butt resting against a catchat the other end. The dart is propelled by a quick motion of thewrist, as in casting with a fly-rod, which swings up the tip of theboard and launches the dart forward. This contrivance, whichpractically makes of the hand a lever 18 inches long, enables thethrower by a slight motion of the wrist to impart great velocity tothe dart. The use of this implement is universal among the Eskimo,though not peculiar to them. The Greenlanders, however, not only useit for the two kinds of darts already mentioned, but have adapted itto the large harpoon.[N323] This is undoubtedly to adapt the largeharpoon for use from the kaiak, which the Greenlanders use morehabitually than most other Eskimo. On the other hand, the people ofBaffin Land and the adjoining regions, as well as the inhabitants ofnortheastern Siberia, use it only with the bird dart.[N324] Throughoutwestern North America the throwing-board is used essentially as atPoint Barrow. Prof. O. T. Mason has given[N325] an interesting accountof the different forms of throwing-board used by the Eskimo and Aleutsof North America.  [Illustration: FIG. 205.--Throwing board for darts. 1/4 1/4]    [Footnote N323: Crantz, vol. 1, p. 146, Pl. V, Figs. 1 and 2, and    Rink as quoted above, also Kane, First Exp., p. 478.]    [Footnote N324: Parry, Second Voyage, p. 508 (Iglulik); and    Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2, p. 105, Fig. 5.]    [Footnote N325: Smithsonian Report for 1884, part II, pp.    279-289.]We obtained five specimens of the form used at Point Barrow. No. 89233[523], Fig. 205_a_, belonging to the set of seal darts bearing thesame collector’s number, has been selected as the type. This is madeof spruce, and the hole is for the forefinger. A little peg of walrusivory, shaped like a flat-headed nail, is driven through the middle ofthe tip so that the edge of the head just projects into the groove.This fits into the hollow in the butt of the dart and serves to steadyit. It is painted red on the back and sides. Fig. 205_b_, No. 89235[60], differs from this in having a double curve instead of beingflat. A slight advantage is gained by this as in a crooked lever. Thecatch is a small iron nail. The others are essentially the same as thetype. No. 89234 [528], has a small brass screw for the catch, and No.89902 [1326], has an ivory peg of a slightly different shape, the headhaving only a projecting point on one side. They are generally paintedwith red ocher except on the inside of the groove. There appears to beno difference between throwing-boards meant for seal darts and thoseused with the bird dart.Unfortunately I had no opportunity of observing accurately how thehandle was grasped, but it is probably held as seen by Beechey atEschscholtz Bay,[N326] namely, with the forefinger in the hole, thethumb and middle finger clasped round the spear, and the third andlittle fingers clasping the handle under the spear. This seems a verynatural way of holding it. Of course, the fingers release the spear atthe moment of casting. All the throwing-boards from Point Barrow areright-handed.    [Footnote N326: Voyage, p. 324.]  [Illustration: FIG. 206.--Harpoon head. 1/2]_Harpoons._--All kinds of marine animals, including the smaller seals,which are also captured with the darts just described and with nets,are pursued with harpoons of the same general type, but of differentpatterns for the different animals. They may be divided into twoclasses--those intended for throwing, which come under the head ofprojectile weapons, and those which do not leave the hand, but arethrust into the animal. These fall properly under the head ofthrusting weapons. Both classes agree in having the head only attachedpermanently to the line, fitted loosely to the end of the shaft, andarranged so that when struck into the animal it is detached from theshaft, and turns under the skin at right angles to the line, like atoggle, so that it is almost impossible for it to draw out.No. 89793 [873], Fig. 206, is a typical toggle head of this kind,intended for a walrus harpoon (túkɐ), and will be described in full,as the names of the different parts will apply to all heads of thisclass. The _body_ is a conoidal piece, 4½ inches in length, andflattened laterally so that at the widest part it is 1 inch wide and0.7 thick. On one side, which may be called the _lower_, it is cut offstraight for about half the longer diameter, while the upper side isproduced into a long, four-sided spur, the _barb_. The _line hole_ isa round hole about one-fourth inch in diameter, a little back of themiddle of the body, at right angles to its longer diameter. From this,on each side, run shallow _line grooves_ to the base of the body,gradually deepening as they run into the line hole. In the middle ofthe base of the body is the deep, cup-shaped _shaft-socket_, whichfits the conical tip of the shaft or fore shaft. In the tip of thebody is cut, at right angles to the longer diameter of the body, andtherefore at right angles to the plane of the barb, the narrow _bladeslit_, 1.1 inches deep, into which fits, secured by a single medianrivet of whalebone, the flat, thin _blade_ of metal (brass in thiscase). This is triangular, with curved edges, narrowly beveled on bothfaces, and is 1.9 inches long and 1 broad.  [Illustration: FIG. 207.--Harpoon head. 1/3]The body is sometimes cut into faces so as to be hexagonal instead ofelliptical in section as in Fig. 207 (No. 89791 [873]), andintermediate forms are common. When such a head is mounted for use abight of the line or _leader_, a short line for connecting the headwith the main line, runs through the line hole so that the head isslung in a loop in the end of the line. The tip of the shaft is thenfitted into the shaft socket and the line brought down the shaft withthe parts of the loop on each side resting in the line grooves and ismade fast, usually so that a slight pull will detach it from theshaft. When the animal is struck the blade cuts a wound large enoughto allow the head to pass in beyond the barb. The struggles of theanimal make the head slip off the tip of the shaft and the strain onthe line immediately toggles it across the wound. The toggle head ofthe whale harpoon is called kia¢ron, of the walrus harpoon, tukɐ, andof the seal harpoon, naulɐ. They are all of essentially the samepattern, differing chiefly in size.  [Illustration: FIG. 208.--Ancient bone harpoon head.]There is in the collection an interesting series of old harpoon heads,showing a number of steps in the development of the modern pattern ofharpoon head from an ancient form. These heads seem to have beenpreserved as amulets; in fact one of them is still attached to a belt.They are not all of the same kind, but since the different kinds asmentioned above practically differ only in size, their development wasprobably the same. The earliest form in the collection is No. 89382[1383], Fig. 208, from Nuwŭk, which is evidently very old, as it ismuch worn and weathered. It is a single flat piece of fine-grainedbone 3 inches long, pointed at the end and provided with a singleunilateral barb. Behind this it is narrowed and then widened into abroad flat base produced on one side into a sharp barb, in the sameplane as the other barb, which represents the blade, but on theopposite side. The line hole is large and irregularly triangular, andthere are no line grooves. Instead of a shaft socket bored in thesolid body, one side of the body is excavated into a deep longitudinalgroove, which was evidently converted into a socket by a transverseband, probably of sealskin, running round the body, and kept in placeby a shallow transverse groove on the convex side of it. A harpoonhead with the socket made by inclosing a groove with thongs was seenby Dr. Kane at Smith Sound.[N327]  [Illustration: FIG. 209.--Harpoon heads: (_a_) ancient bone harpoon  head: (_b_) variant of the type. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 210.--Bone harpoon head. 1/2]The next form, No. 89331 [932], Fig. 209_a_, has two bilateral barbsto the blade part, thus increasing its holding power. Instead of anopen transverse groove to hold the thong, it has two slots parallel tothe socket groove running obliquely to the other side, where they openinto a shallow depression. Figs. 209_b_ and 210, Nos. 89544 [1419] and89377 [766], are variants of this form, probably intended for thelarger seal, as the blade part is very long in proportion. No. 89544[1419] is interesting from its close resemblance to the spear headfigured by Nordenskiöld[N328] from the ancient “Onkilon” house atNorth Cape. No. 89377 [766] is a peculiar form, which was perhaps notgeneral, as it has left no descendants among the modern harpoon.Instead of the bilateral blade barbs it has an irregular slot on eachside, which evidently served to hold a blade of stone, and the singlebarb of the body is replaced by a cluster of four, which are neitherin the plane of the blade nor at right angles to it, but between thetwo. No modern harpoon heads from Point Barrow have more than twobarbs on the body. The next improvement was to bore the shaft socketinstead of making it by inclosing a groove with thongs. This is shownin Fig. 211 (No. 89379 [795], from Utkiavwĭñ), which is just like No.89544 [1419] except in this respect. The line grooves first appear atthis stage of the development.  [Illustration: FIG. 211.--Bone harpoon head. 1/2]    [Footnote N327: Second Grinnell Exp., vol. 1, Figs. on pp. 412 and    413.]    [Footnote N328: Vega, vol. 1, p. 444, Fig. 5.]The next step was to obtain greater penetration by substituting atriangular blade of stone for the barbed bone point, with its breadthstill in the plane of the body barb. This blade was either of slate(No. 89744 [969] from Nuwŭk) or of flint, as in Fig. 212 (No. 89748[928], also from Nuwŭk). Both of these are whale harpoons, such as aresometimes used even at the present day.  [Illustration: FIG. 212.--Harpoon head, bone and stone. 1/3]Before the introduction of iron it was discovered that if the bladewere inserted at right angles to the plane of the body barb theharpoon would have a surer hold, since the strain on the line wouldalways draw it at right angles to the length of the wound cut by theblade. This is shown in Fig. 213 (No. 56620 [199], a walrus harpoonhead from Utkiavwĭñ), which has the slate blade inserted in thisposition. Substituting a metal blade for the stone one gives us themodern toggle head, as already described. That the insertion of thestone blade preceded the rotation of the plane of the latter is,I think, conclusively shown by the whale harpoons[N329] alreadymentioned, in spite of the fact that we have a bone harpoon head inthe collection, No. 89378 [1261], figured in Point Barrow report,which is exactly like No. 89379 [795], except that it has the blade_at right angles_ to the plane of the body barb. This is, however,a newly made model in reindeer antler of the ancient harpoon, and wasevidently made by a man so used to the modern pattern that he forgotthis important distinction. The development of this spear head hasbeen carried no further at Point Barrow. At one or two places,however, namely, at Cumberland Gulf in the east[N330] and at SledgeIsland in the west (as shown in Mr. Nelson’s collection), they go astep further in making the head of the seal harpoon, body and blade,of one piece of iron. The shape, however, is the same as those withthe ivory or bone body.  [Illustration: FIG. 213.--Harpoon head, bone and stone. 1/2]    [Footnote N329: Compare, also, the walrus harpoon figured by Capt.    Lyon, Parry’s Second Voyage, Pl. opposite p. 550, Fig. 13.]    [Footnote N330: See Kumlien, Contributions, p. 35, and Boas,    “Central Eskimo,” p. 473, Fig. 393.]All of the Eskimo race, as far as I have any definite information, usetoggle harpoon-heads. There are specimens in the National Museum fromGreenland, Cumberland Gulf, the Anderson and Mackenzie region, andfrom the Alaskan coast from Point Barrow to Kadiak, as well as fromSt. Lawrence Island, which are all of essentially the same type, butslightly modified in different localities. The harpoon head in use atSmith Sound is of the same form as the walrus harpoon heads used atPoint Barrow, but appears always to have the shaft socket made by agroove closed with thongs.[N331] In Danish Greenland, however, thebody has an extra pair of bilateral barbs below the blade. TheGreenlanders have, as it were, substituted a metal blade for the pointonly of the barbed blade portion of such a bone head as No. 89379[795].[N332]    [Footnote N331: Kane, 2d Grinnell Exp., vol. 1, pp. 412 and 413    (Fig. 1), and Bessells, Naturalist, vol. 18, pt. 9, p. 869, Figs.    6-12.]    [Footnote N332: Crantz, vol. 1, p. 146, and Pl. V, Figs. 1 and 2,    and Rink Tales, etc., Pl. opposite p. 10.]Curiously enough, this form of the toggle head appears again in theMackenzie and Anderson region, as shown by the extensive collectionsof Ross, MacFarlane, and others. In this region the metal blade itselfis often cut into one or more pairs of bilateral barbs. At the Straitsof Fury and Hecla, Parry found the harpoon head, with a body like thewalrus harpoon heads at Point Barrow,[N333] but with the blade _in theplane_ of the body barb. Most of the pictures scattered through thework represent the blade in this position, but Fig. 19 on the sameplate has the blade at right angles to the barb, so that the olderform may not be universal. At Cumberland Gulf the form of the body isconsiderably modified, though the blade is of the usual shape and inthe ordinary position. The body is flattened at right angles to theusual direction, so that the thickness is much greater than the width.It always has two body barbs. On the western coast the harpoon headsare much less modified, though there is a tendency to increase thenumber of body barbs, at the same time ornamenting the body moreelaborately as we go south from Bering Strait. Walrus harpoon headswith a single barb, hardly distinguishable from those used at PointBarrow, are in the collection from the Diomedes and all along thenorthern shore of Norton Sound, and one also from the mouth of theKuskoquim. They are probably also used from Point Barrow to KotzebueSound. At St. Lawrence Island and on the Asiatic shore they are thecommon if not the universal form.[N334] The seal harpoon head (naulɐ)at Point Barrow appears always to have the body barb split at the tipinto two, and this is the case rarely with the tu´kɐ. This form, whichappears occasionally north of Norton Sound (Port Clarence, Cape Nome),appears to be more common south of this locality, where, however,a pattern with the barb divided into three points seems to be theprevailing form. I will now proceed to the description of thedifferent forms of harpoon with which these toggle heads are used.    [Footnote N333: 2d Voyage, Pl. opposite p. 550, Fig. 13.]    [Footnote N334: Museum collections and Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2,    p. 105, Fig. 1. This figure shows the blade _in the plane_ of the    barb, but none of the specimens from Plover Bay are of this form.]Throwing-harpoons are always thrown from the hand without athrowing-board or other assistance, and are of two sizes, one for thewalrus and bearded seal, and one for the small seals. Both have a longshaft of wood to the tip of which is attached a heavy bone or ivoryforeshaft, usually of greater diameter than the shaft and somewhatclub-shaped. This serves the special purpose of giving weight to thehead of the harpoon, so it can be darted with a sure aim. The nativename of this part of the spear, ukumailuta (Greenlandic, okimailutaĸ,_weight_), indicates its design. This contrivance of weighting thehead of the harpoon with a heavy foreshaft is peculiar to the westernEskimo. On all the eastern harpoons (see figures referred to above andthe Museum collections) the foreshaft is a simple cap of bone nolarger than the shaft the tip of which it protects. Between theforeshaft and the toggle-head is interposed the _loose shaft_(i´gimû), a slender rod of bone whose tip fits into the shaft socketof the head, while its butt fits loosely in a socket in the tip of theforeshaft. It is secured to the shaft by a thong just long enough toallow it to be unshipped from the foreshaft. This not only preventsthe loose shaft from breaking under a lateral strain, but by its playfacilitates unshipping the head. On these harpoons intended forthrowing, this loose shaft is always short. This brings the weight ofthe foreshaft close to the head, while it leaves space enough for thehead to penetrate beyond the barb.The walrus harpoon varies in size, being adapted to the strength andstature of the owner. Of the six in our collection, the longest, whenmounted for use, is 9 feet 6 inches long, and the shortest 5 feet 8inches. The ordinary length appears to be about 7 feet. It has a long,heavy shaft (ipua) of wood, usually between 5 and 6 feet long andtapering from a diameter of 1½ inches at the head to about 1 inch atthe butt. The head is not usually fastened directly to the line, buthas a leader of double thong 1 to 2 feet long, with a becket at theend into which the main line is looped or hitched. At the other end ofthe line, which is about 30 feet long, is another becket to which isfastened a float consisting of a whole sealskin inflated. When thehead is fitted on the tip of the loose shaft the line is brought downto the middle of the shaft and hooked by means of a little becket toan ivory peg (ki´lerbwĭñ) projecting from the side of the shaft. Theeastern Eskimo have, in place of the simple becket, a neat littlecontrivance consisting of a plate of ivory lashed to the line with alarge slot in it which hooks over the catch, but nothing of the sortwas observed at Point Barrow.The harpoon thus mounted is poised in the right hand with theforefinger resting against a curved ivory projection (ti´ka) anddarted like a white man’s harpoon, the float and line being thrownoverboard at the same time. When a walrus is struck the head slips offand toggles as already described; the line detaches itself from thecatch, leaving the shaft free to float and be picked up. The float isnow fastened to the walrus, and, like the shaft of the seal dart, bothshows his whereabouts and acts as a drag on his movements until he is“played” enough for the hunters to come up and dispatch him. Thisweapon is called u´nakpûk, “the great u´na or spear.” U´na (unâk,u´nañ) appears to be a generic term in Eskimo for harpoon, but atPoint Barrow is now restricted to the harpoon used for stabbing sealsas they come up to their breathing holes.We collected six of these walrus harpoons complete and forty-twoseparate heads. Of these, No. 56770 [534], Fig. 214_a_, has the mosttypical shaft and loose shaft. The shaft is of spruce 71 inches long,roughly rounded, and tapering from a diameter of 1½ inches at the tipto 0.8 at the butt. The foreshaft is of white walrus ivory, 6.7 incheslong, exclusive of the wedge-shaped tang which fits into a cleft inthe tip of the shaft. It is somewhat club-shaped, being 1.6 inches indiameter at the tip and tapering to 1.3 just above the butt, whichexpands to the diameter of the shaft, and is separated from the tangby a square transverse shoulder. The shaft and foreshaft are fastenedtogether by a whipping of broad seal thong, put on wet, one endpassing through a hole in the foreshaft one-quarter inch from theshaft, and kept from slipping by a low transverse ridge on each sideof the tang. In the tip of the foreshaft is a deep, round socket toreceive the loose shaft, which is a tapering rod of walrus ivory 4.4inches long, shouldered off at the butt, which is 0.7 inch indiameter, to a blunt, rounded tang 0.9 inch long. It fits loosely intothe foreshaft up to the shoulder, and is secured by a piece of narrowseal thong which passes through a transverse hole one-half inch abovethe shoulder. The end is spliced to the standing part with doubleslits about 6 inches from the loose shaft, and the other end makes acouple of turns outside of the lashing on the shaft mentioned aboveand is secured with two half-hitches.  [Illustration: FIG. 214.--Walrus harpoons. 1/12 1/15]The line catch (ki´lerbwĭñ) is a little, blunt, backward-pointing hookof ivory inserted in the shaft 17 inches from the tip and projectingabout one-third inch. Ten and one-fourth inches farther back and 90degrees round the shaft from the line catch is the finger rest--aconical recurved piece of ivory 1 inch high, with a flat base, restingagainst the shaft and secured by a lashing of whalebone, which passesthrough two corresponding holes, one in the rest and one in the shaft.The head and line belonging to this harpoon are intended for huntingthe bearded seal, and will be described below. No. 56772 [536], Fig.214_b_, from Utkiavwĭñ, is fitted with fairly typical walrus gear. Thehead is of the typical form, 6 inches long, with a conoidal body ofwalrus ivory, ornamented with incised lines colored with red ocher,and a blade of steel secured by a whalebone rivet. The “leader,” whichis about 15 inches long, is made by passing one end of a piece ofstout walrus-hide thong about one-quarter inch wide through the linehole and doubling it with the head in the bight, so that one part isabout 6 inches the longer. The two parts are stopped together about 2inches from the head with a bit of sinew braid. The ends are joinedand made into a becket, as follows: The longer end is doubled back for7 inches and a slit cut through both parts about 2 inches from theend. The shorter end is passed through this slit, and a slit is cut 5inches from the end of this, through which the loop of the other endis passed and all drawn taut. The whole joint is then tightly seizedwith sinew braid so as to leave a becket 3 inches and a free end 4inches long. This becket is looped into an eye 1½ inches long at theend of the main line, made by doubling over 5 inches of the end andstopping the two parts firmly together with sinew braid. The line isof the hide of the bearded seal, about the same diameter as theleader, and 27 feet long. It is in two nearly equal parts, splicedtogether with double slits, firmly seized with sinew braid. There is abecket about 8 inches long at the other end of the line for attachingthe float, made by doubling over the end and tying a carrick bend, theend of which is stopped back to the standing part with sinew braid.The becket to hook upon the line catch is a bit of sinew braid,fastened to the line 2½ feet from the head, as follows: One end beinglaid against the line it is doubled in a bight and the end is whippeddown to the line by the other end, which makes five turns round them.I will now consider the variations of the different parts of theseharpoons in detail, beginning with the head. Our series is so large,containing in all forty-eight heads, besides some spare blades, thatit probably gives a fair representation of the common variations. Thelongest of this series is 6 inches long and the shortest 3½, but byfar the greater number are from 4½ to 5 inches long. Their proportionsare usually about as in the types figured, but the long head justfigured (No. 56772 [534]) is also unusually slender. Sheet brass isthe commonest material for the blade (thirty blades are of thismaterial), though iron or steel is sometimes used, and rarely, atpresent, slate. There is one slate-bladed head in the series(No. 56620 [199]) figured above, and four blades for such heads. Theblade is commonly of the shape of the type figured, triangular withcurved edges, varying from a rather long triangle like the slate bladejust mentioned to a rather short one with very strongly curved edgeslike Fig. 215_a_ (No. 89750 [1038]), which is peculiar as the onlywalrus harpoon head with a body of reindeer antler. It also has aniron blade and a rivet of iron, not seldom with rounded basal anglesso as to be almost heart-shaped, like Fig. 215_b_ (No. 56621 [283]).A less common shape of blade is lanceolate, with the base cut offsquare as in Fig. 216_a_ (No. 89764 [940]). Only eight blades out ofthe series are of this shape. A still more peculiar shape of blade, ofwhich we saw only one specimen, is shown in Fig. 216_b_ (No. 89790[943]). This is made of brass. It was perhaps meant for an imitationof the barbed blades used at the Mackenzie, of which I have alreadyspoken.  [Illustration: FIG. 215.--Typical walrus-harpoon heads. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 216.--Typical walrus-harpoon heads. 1/2]The blade, when of metal, is generally fastened in with a singlerivet. One only out of the whole number has two rivets, and three aresimply wedged into the blade slit. The slate blades appear never tohave been riveted; Nordenskiöld, however, figures a walrus harpoonfrom Port Clarence[N335] with a jade blade riveted in. The rivet isgenerally made of whalebone, but other materials are sometimes used.For instance, in the series collected two have rivets of iron, two ofwood, and five of rawhide. The body is generally made of white walrusivory, (five of those collected are of hard bone, and one alreadymentioned and figured, No. 89750 [1038], Fig. 215_a_, is of reindeerantler), and the hexagonal shape, often with rounded edges, and theline grooves continued to the tip, as in Fig. 217_a_, No. 89757 [947],appears to be the commonest. Three out of the forty-eight havefour-sided bodies. It is unusual for the body barb to be bifurcated,as is common farther south. Only three out of the forty-eight showthis peculiarity, of which No. 56613 [53], Fig. 217_b_, is an example.    [Footnote N335: Vega, vol. 2, p. 229, Fig. 3.]The specimens figured show the different styles of ornamentation,which always consist of incised patterns colored with red ocher orrarely with soot. These never represent natural objects, but arealways conventional patterns, generally a single or double border ontwo or more faces with short oblique cross-lines and branches. Harpoonheads at Point Barrow are probably never ornamented with the “circlesand dots,” so common on other implements and on the harpoons of thesouthern Eskimo.  [Illustration: FIG. 217.--Typical walrus-harpoon heads. 1/2]Twenty-eight of the heads still have the leaders attached to them. Theobject of this short line is to enable the hunter to readily detach abroken head and put on a fresh one without going to the trouble ofundoing a splice, which must be made strong to keep the head fromseparating from the line. It is made of a stout piece of rawhidethong, the skin of the walrus or bearded seal, about one-third inch indiameter, and usually from 2 to 3 feet long. It is always passedthrough the line hole, as in the specimen described, and the ends aremade into a becket for attaching the line, with an end left to serveas a handle for pulling the two beckets apart when the main line endsin a becket. Occasionally (two are made this way) the longer end issimply doubled in a bight, and the three parts are then seizedtogether with sinew braid, but it is generally made with a splice, thedetails of which differ slightly on the different leaders.  [Illustration: FIG. 218.--Walrus-harpoon head, with leader. 1/3]  [Illustration: FIG. 219.--Walrus-harpoon head, with line. 4/9]  [Illustration: FIG. 220.--Walrus-harpoon head, with line. 1/3]The commonest method is that already described. When the longer end isdoubled over, a slit is cut through both parts close to the end ofthis through which the shorter end is passed. A slit is then cut a fewinches from the tip of this part, the bight of the becket passedthrough this slit and all drawn taut. This makes a very strong splice.Fourteen beckets are spliced in this way. A variation of this splicehas a slit only through the end part of the longer end, the shorterend being passed through and slit as before. In one becket thestanding part of the longer end is passed through the slit of the endpart before going through the line hole, while the rest of the becketis made as before. A reversed splice is found on three of the leaders,which is made as follows: When the long end is doubled over, the shortend is slit as usual and the longer end passed through this and slitclose to the tip. Through this slit is passed the head and all drawntaut. The splice is always firmly seized with sinew braid. The mainline, which serves to attach the head to the float, is always made ofstout thong, preferably the skin of the bearded seal (very fine linesare sometimes made of beluga skin), about one-third inch square, and,when properly made, trimmed off on the edges so as to be almost round.It is about 10 yards long. It is fastened into the becket of theleader with a becket hitch tied upside down (No. 56771 [535], Fig.218), or by means of a small becket, made either as on the specimendescribed (No. 56770 [536], Fig. 219), or spliced with double slits.The long becket at the other end for attaching the float is madeeither by tying a carrick bend with the end stopped back to thestanding part (Fig. 220, No. 56767 [531]), or by splicing (Fig. 221,No. 56769).  [Illustration: FIG. 221.--Walrus-harpoon head, with line. 1/2]The loose shaft varies very little in shape, though it is sometimesrounded off at the butt without a shoulder, but the line which securesthis to the foreshaft is put on differently on each of the six spears.Five of them have the end simply passed through the hole in the looseshaft and spliced to the standing part, but two (the type figured andNo. 56768 [532]) have the other end carried down and hitched round thetip of the shaft; another has it passed through a hole in theforeshaft, taken 1½ turns round this and knotted (No. 56771 [535]);another has a loop as long as the foreshaft with the short end passedunder the first turn of the shaft lashing before it is spliced, andthe long end secured as on the first mentioned; and the fifth has theend passed through a hole in the foreshaft and carried down andwrapped round the shaft lashing. The sixth has one end passed througha hole in the smallest part of the foreshaft and knotted at the end,the other end carried up through the hole in the loose shaft and downto a second hole in the foreshaft close to the first, then up throughthe loose shaft, and down through the first hole, and tucked under thetwo parts on the other side.The foreshaft is made of walrus ivory or the hard bone of the walrusjaw and varies little in form and dimensions. It is sometimesornamented by carving, as in No. 56772 [536], or by incised patterns,as in Fig. 222, No. 56538 [98], and generally has one or two deeplongitudinal notches in the thickest part, in which the lines can bedrawn snugly down. It usually is joined to the shaft by a stout,wedge-shaped tang, which fits into a corresponding cleft in the shaft,and is secured by wooden treenails and a wrapping of seal thong orsinew braid, sometimes made more secure by passing one end throughholes in the foreshaft. No. 56768 [532] is peculiar in having the tangon the shaft and the corresponding cleft in the foreshaft. The shaftitself varies little in shape and proportions, and at the present dayis sometimes made of ash or other hard wood obtained from the ships.The line catch is generally a little hook of ivory or hard bone likethe one described, but two specimens have small screws fastened intothe shaft to serve this purpose. The finger rest is ordinarily of thesame shape as on the type and fastened on in the same way, but No.56771 [535] has this made of a knob of ivory elaborately carved into aseal’s head. The eyes are represented by round bits of ivory withpupils drilled in them inlaid in the head. This is evidently the knobof a seal drag (see below) as the longitudinal perforation from chinto nape now serves no purpose. It is fastened on by a lashing ofwhalebone, which runs round the shaft and through a transverse hole inthe knob.  [Illustration: FIG. 222.--Foreshaft of walrus harpoon. 1/3]Harpoons closely resembling these in type are used by the Eskimo ofwestern North America wherever they habitually hunt the walrus. Atmany places this heavy spear is armed at the butt with a long sharppick of ivory like the smaller seal spear. Two of these large harpoonsappear to be rigged especially for the pursuit of the bearded seal, asthey have heads which are of precisely the same shape and material asthe small seal harpoons in the collection. Both these heads havelanceolate iron blades, conoidal antler bodies with double barbs, andare more slender than the walrus harpoon heads. No. 56770 [534], Fig.219, has a head 4 inches long and 0.7 broad at the widest part, andfastened to a very long line (12 fathoms long) without a leader, theend being simply passed through the line hole and seized down to thestanding part with sinew braid. This is the method of attaching thehead of the small seal harpoons. This line is so long that it may havebeen held in the boat and not attached to a float. No. 56768 [532],however, has a leader with a becket of the ordinary style. Fig. 223,No. 56611 [89], is a head similar to those just described, andprobably, from its size, intended for large seals. It is highlyornamented with the usual reddened incised pattern.  [Illustration: FIG. 223.--Harpoon head for large seals. 1/2]The throwing harpoon for small seals is an exact copy in miniature ofthe walrus harpoon, with the addition of a long bayonet-shaped pick ofivory at the butt. The line, however, is upwards of 30 yards long, andthe end never leaves the hand. The line is hitched round the shaftback of the line catch, which now only serves to keep the line fromslipping forward, as the shaft is never detached from the line. Thisharpoon is used exclusively for retrieving seals that have been shotin open holes or leads of water within darting distance from the edgeof the solid ice, and is thrown precisely as the walrus harpoon is,except that the end of the line is held in the left hand. In travelingover the ice the line with the head attached is folded in long hanksand slung on the gun case at the back. The rest of the weapon iscarried in the hand and serves as a staff in walking and climbingamong the ice, where the sharp pick is useful to prevent slipping andto try doubtful ice, and also enables the hunter to break away thinice at the edge of the hole, so as to draw his game up to the solidfloe. It can also serve as a bayonet in case of necessity. Thispeculiar form of harpoon is confined to the coast from Point Barrow toBering Strait, the only region where the seal is hunted with the riflein the small open holes of water.[N336]    [Footnote N336: See the writer’s note on this weapon, American    Naturalist, vol. 19, p. 423.]Since my note in the Naturalist was written, I have learned from Mr.Henry Balfour, of the museum at Oxford, that their collection containstwo or three specimens of this very pattern of harpoon, undoubtedlycollected by some of the officers of the _Blossom_. Consequently, mytheory that the retrieving harpoon was a modern invention, due to theintroduction of firearms, becomes untenable, as the _Blossom_ visitedthis region before firearms were known to the Eskimo. It was probablyoriginally intended for the capture of seals “hauled out” on the icein the early summer. There is no doubt, however, that it is at thepresent day used for nothing but retrieving.  [Illustration: FIG. 224.--Retrieving seal harpoon. 1/10]Though this weapon was universally used at Point Barrow, we happenedto obtain only two specimens, possibly because the natives thoughtthem too necessary an implement to part with lightly. No. 89907[1695], Figs. 224, 225, has a new shaft, etc., but was used severaltimes by the maker before it was offered for sale. Such a retrievingharpoon is called naúlĭgɐ. The shaft (ipúa) is of ash, 4 feet 5 incheslong and 1 inch in diameter, tapering very slightly to each end. Theice pick (túu) of walrus ivory, 14 inches long and 1 inch wide, has around tang fitting into a hole in the butt of the shaft. Close to theshaft a small hole is drilled in one edge of the pick, and throughthis is passed a bit of seal thong, the ends of which are laid alongthe shaft and neatly whipped down with sinew braid, with the endwedged into a slit in the wood. The foreshaft (ukumailuta) is ofwalrus ivory, 4½ inches long and 1½ inches in diameter at the thickestpart, and secured to the shaft by a whipping (nĭ´mxa) of seal thong.The loose shaft (ígimû) is also of ivory and 2 inches long and securedby a thong (ĭpíuta) spliced into a loop through the hole at the butt,as previously described. The end is hitched round the tip of the shaftwith a marling hitch, followed by a clove hitch below the whipping.The ivory finger rest (ti´ka) is fastened on with a lashing of whipcord (white man’s) passing round the shaft. The line catch(ki´lerbwĭñ), which was of ivory and shaped like those on the walrusharpoons, has been lost in transportation. The head differs only insize from those just described as intended for the bearded seal,except in having a hexagonal body. It is 3.3 inches long and has ablade of iron fastened into a body of walrus ivory with a singlewooden rivet. While there is no detachable leader, the head isattached by a separate piece of the same material to the line(tûkăksia), which is 86 feet 10 inches long and made of a single pieceof fine seal thong about one-eighth inch thick. This shorter piece isabout 27 inches long and is passed through the line hole and doubledso that one part is a little the longer. It is fastened strongly tothe end of the line by a complicated splice made as follows: A slit iscut in the end of the main line through which are passed both ends ofthe short line. The longer part is then slit about 2 inches from theend and the shorter part passed through the slit, and a slit cut closeto the end of it, through which the longer end is passed. The whole isthen drawn taut and the longer end clove hitched round the main line.  [Illustration: FIG. 225.--Details of retrieving seal harpoon. 1/4]No. 89908 [1058] is one of these spears rigged ready for darting. Theline is secured at about the middle of the shaft with a couple ofmarling hitches. This specimen, except the head, is new and was rathercarelessly made for the market. It has neither line catch nor fingerrest. The foreshaft and ice pick are lashed in with sinew braid, whichis first knotted round the tip of the shaft and then hitched roundwith a series of left-handed soldier’s hitches. The end of the thongwhich holds the loose shaft is passed through the hole in it andknotted and the other end hitched into the pulley at the smallest partof the foreshaft. The head is like that of the preceding, but has aconoidal body of reindeer antler, a common material for seal-harpoonheads, and the line, which is of stout sinew braid 43 feet long, isattached to it simply by passing the end through the line hole andtying it with a clove hitch to the standing part 9½ inches from thehead. This spear is about the same size as the preceding. Theseweapons are all of the same general pattern, but vary in lengthaccording to the height of the owner. The heads for these harpoons, aswell as for the other form of seal harpoon, are usually about 3 incheslong, and, as a rule, have lanceolate blades. The body is generallyconoidal, often made of reindeer antler, and always, apparently, witha double barb. It is generally plain, but sometimes ornamented likethe walrus-harpoon heads.  [Illustration: FIG. 226.--Jade blade for seal harpoon.]No. 89784 [1008] was made by Ilû´bw’ga, the Nunatañmeun, when thinkingof coming to winter at Utkiavwĭñ. He had had no experience in sealing,having apparently spent all his winters on the rivers inland, and thisharpoon head seems to have been condemned as unsatisfactory by his newfriends at Utkiavwĭñ. It looks like a very tolerable naula, but isunusually small, being only 2½ inches long.We saw only one stone blade for a seal harpoon, No. 89623 [1418], Fig.226. This is of light olive green jade, and triangular, withpeculiarly dull edges and point. Each face is concaved, and there is ahole for a rivet. (Compare the jade-bladed harpoon figured byNordenskiöld and referred to above.) It is 2 inches long and 0.7 inchwide at the base. It appears to have been kept as an amulet. The otherform of seal harpoon comes properly under the next head.THRUSTING WEAPONS._Harpoons._--For the capture of seals as they come up for air to theirbreathing holes or cracks in the ice a harpoon is used which has ashort wooden shaft, armed, as before, with an ice pick and a long,slender, loose shaft suited for thrusting down through the smallbreathing hole. It carries a núalɐ like the other harpoon, but hasonly a short line, the end of which is made fast permanently to theshaft. Such harpoons are used by all Eskimo wherever they are in thehabit of watching for seals at their breathing holes. The slender partof the shaft, however, is not always loose.[N337] The foreshaft issimply a stout ferrule for the end of the shaft. These weapons are ingeneral use at Point Barrow and are very neatly made.    [Footnote N337: Parry, Second Voyage, p. 507, Iglulik.]  [Illustration: FIG. 227.--Seal harpoon for thrusting.]We obtained two specimens, of which No. 89910 [1694], Fig. 227, willserve as the type. The total length of this spear when rigged for useis 5 feet 3 inches. The shaft is of spruce, 20½ inches long and 1.1inches in the middle, tapering to 0.9 at the ends. At the butt isinserted, as before, an ivory ice pick (túu) of the form alreadydescribed, 13¾ inches long and lashed in with sinew braid. Theforeshaft (kátû) is of walrus ivory, nearly cylindrical, 5¾ incheslong and 0.9 inch in diameter, shouldered at the butt and fitted intothe tip of the shaft with a round tang. The latter is very neatlywhipped with a narrow strip of white whalebone, which makes eleventurns and has the end of the last turn forced into a slit in the woodand wedged with a round wooden peg. Under this whipping is the bill ofa tern as a charm for good luck. (As the boy who pointed this out tome said, “Lots of seals.”)  [Illustration: FIG. 228.--Diagram of lashing on shaft.]The loose shaft (ígimû) is of bone, whale’s rib or jaw, and has twotransverse holes above the shoulder to receive the end of theassembling line (sábromia), which not only holds the loose shaft inplace, but also connects the other parts of the shaft so that in casethe wood breaks the pieces will not be dropped. It is a long piece ofseal thong, of which one end makes a turn round the loose shaftbetween the holes; the other end is passed through the lower hole,then through the upper and carried down to the tip of the shaft, whereit is hitched just below the whalebone whipping, as follows: threeturns are made round the shaft, the first over the standing part, thesecond under, and the third over it; the end then is passed under 3,over 2, and under 1 (Fig. 228), and all drawn taut; it then runs downthe shaft almost to the butt-lashing and is secured with the samehitch, and the end is whipped around the butt of the ice pick withfive turns. The head (naúlɐ) is of the ordinary pattern, 2.8 incheslong, with a copper blade and antler body. The line (túkăktĭn) is asingle piece of seal thong 9 feet long, and is fastened to the headwithout a leader, by simply passing the end through the line-hole,doubling it over and stopping it to the standing part so as to make abecket 21 inches long. The other end is made fast round the shaft andassembling line just back of the middle, as follows: An eye is made atthe end of the line, by cutting a slit close to the tip and pushing abight of the line through this. The end then makes a turn round theshaft, and the other end, with the head, is passed through this eyeand drawn taut. When mounted for use, the head is fitted on the tip ofthe loose shaft as usual and the line brought down to the tip of theshaft and made fast by two or three round turns with a bight tuckedunder, so that it can be easily slipped. It is also confined to theloose shaft by the end of the assembling line, which makes one or twoloose turns round it. The slack of the line is doubled into “fakes”and tucked between the shaft and assembling line.  [Illustration: FIG. 229.--Model of a seal harpoon. 1/3]The other specimen is of the same pattern, but slightly differentproportions, having a shaft 18½ inches long and a pick 19 inches long.The loose shaft is of ivory, and there are lashings of white whaleboneat each end of the shaft. The assembling line is hitched round theforeshaft as well as round the two ends of the shaft, and simplyknotted round the pick. The line is of very stout sinew braid, and hasan eye neatly spliced in the end for looping it round the shaft. Fig.229, No. 89551 [1082], is a model of one of these harpoons, made forsale. It is 16¼ inches long, and correct in all its parts, except thatthe whole head is of ivory, even to having the ends of the shaftwhipped with light-colored whalebone. The shaft is of pine and therest of walrus ivory, with lines of sinew braid. We also collectedfour loose shafts for such harpoons. One of these, No. 89489 [802], isof whale’s bone and unusually short, only 14 inches long. It perhapsbelonged to a lad’s spear. The other three are long, 20 to 25 inches,and are made of narwhal ivory, as is shown by the spiral twist in thegrain.The harpoon used for the whale fishery is a heavy, bulky weapon, whichis never thrown, but thrust with both hands as the whale rises underthe bows of the umiak. When not in use it rests in a large ivorycrotch, shaped like a rowlock, in the bow. The shaft is of wood and 8or 9 feet long, and there is no loose shaft, the bone or ivoryforeshaft being tapered off to a slender point of such a shape thatthe head easily unships. This foreshaft is not weighted, as in thewalrus harpoon, since this is not necessary in a weapon which does notleave the hand. The harpoon line is fitted with two inflated sealskinfloats.  [Illustration: FIG. 230.--Large model of a whale harpoon. 1/12 1/6]No complete, genuine whaling harpoons were ever offered for sale, buta man at Nuwûk made a very excellent reduced model about two-thirdsthe usual size (No. 89909 [1023], Fig. 230), which will serve as thetype of this weapon (a´jyûñ). This is 6 feet 11 inches in length whenrigged for use. The shaft is of pine, 5 feet 8½ inches long, with itsgreatest diameter (1½ inches) well forward of the middle and taperedmore toward the butt than toward the tip, which is chamfered off onone side to fit the butt of the foreshaft (igimû), and shouldered tokeep the lashing in place. The foreshaft is of whale’s bone, 11½inches long, three-sided with one edge rounded off, and tapers from adiameter of 1 inch to a tapering rounded point 1½ inches long, andslightly curved away from the flat face of the foreshaft. It willeasily be seen that the shape of this tip facilitates the unshippingof the head. The butt is chamfered off on the flat face to fit thechamfer of the shaft, and the whole foreshaft is slightly curved inthe same direction as the tip. It is secured to the shaft by a stoutwhipping of seal thong. The head is 7 inches long, and has a body ofwalrus ivory, which is ornamented with incised patterns colored redwith ocher, and a blade of dark reddish brown jasper, neatly flaked.This blade is not unlike a large arrow head, being triangular, withcurved edges, and a short, broad tang imbedded in the tip of the body,which is seized round with sinew braid. The body is unusually long andslender and is four sided, with a single long, sharp barb, keeled onthe outer face. The line hole and line grooves are in the usualposition, but the peculiarity of the head is that the blade isinserted with its breadth in the plane of the body barb. In otherwords, this head has not reached the last stage in the development ofthe toggle-head. The line is of stout thong (the skin of the beardedseal) and about 8½ feet long. It is passed through the line hole,doubled in the middle, the two parts are firmly stopped together withsinew in four places, and in the ends are cut long slits for loopingon the floats. When the head is fitted on the foreshaft the line issecured to the flat face of the foreshaft by a little stop made of asingle strand of sinew, easily broken. About 28 inches from the tip ofthe shaft the line is doubled forward and the bight stopped to theshaft with six turns of seal thong, so that the line is held in placeand yet can be easily detached by a straight pull. The ends are thendoubled back over the lashing and stopped to the shaft with a singlethread of sinew.  [Illustration: FIG. 231.--Model of whale harpoon with floats. 3/8]Fig. 231 is a toy model of the whale harpoon, No. 56562 [233], 18½inches long, made of pine and ivory, and shows the manner of attachingthe floats, which are little blocks of spruce roughly whittled intothe shape of inflated sealskins. A piece of seal thong 13½ inches longhas its ends looped round the neck of the floats and the harpoon-lineis looped into a slit in the middle of this line.  [Illustration: FIG. 232.--Flint blade for whale harpoon.]We collected thirteen heads for such harpoons, which have been inactual use, of which two have flint blades like the one described, twohave brass blades, and the rest either blades of slate or else noblades. The flint blades are either triangular like the one describedor lanceolate and are about 3 inches long exclusive of the tang. Thethree separate flint blades which we obtained (Fig. 232, No. 56708[114], from Utkiavwĭñ, is one of these, made of black flint) are about1 inch shorter and were perhaps intended for walrus harpoons, thoughwe saw none of these with flint blades. They are all newly made forthe market.  [Illustration: FIG. 233.--Slate blade for whale harpoon.]The slate blades of which we collected eleven, some old and some new,besides those in the heads, are all triangular, with curved edges, asin Fig. 233 (No. 56709 [139] from Utkiavwĭñ, made of soft purpleslate), except one new one, No. 56697_a_ [188_a_], which has thecorners cut off so as to give it a rhomboidal shape. The corners aresometimes rounded off so that they are nearly heart-shaped. Theseblades are usually about 2¾ inches long and 2 broad; two unusuallylarge ones are 3 inches long and nearly 2¼ broad, and one small one2.1 by 1.6 inches, and are simply wedged into the blade slit without arivet. The brass blades are of the same shape.The common material for the body seems to have been rather coarsewhale’s bone, from the rib or jaw. Only two out of the thirteen haveivory bodies, and these are both of the newer brass-bladed pattern.The body is very long and slender, being usually about 8 or 8½ incheslong (one is 9¼ inches long) and not over 1½ inches broad at thewidest part. It is always cut off very obliquely at the base, and thepart in front of the line hole is contracted to a sort of shank, as inFig. 234 (No. 89747 [1044]), a head with slate blade (broken) and bonebody. This represents a very common form in which the shank isfour-sided, while back of the middle the outer face of the barb risesinto a ridge, making this part of the body five-sided. The edges ofthe shank are sometimes rounded off so as to make this part ellipticalin section, and all the edges of the body except the keel, on theouter face of the barb, are frequently rounded off as in Fig. 235_a_,No. 89745 [1044], which has a slate blade wedged into the bone bodywith a bit of old cloth and a wooden wedge. Fig. 235_b_, No. 56602[157], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a head of the same shape, but has a brassblade and a body of ivory. This blade is wedged in with deer hair, butthe other brass-bladed harpoon, No. 56601 [137], has a single rivet ofwhalebone.  [Illustration: FIG. 234.--Body of whale harpoon head. 1/3]The blade slit, and consequently the blade, is always in the plane ofthe barb, which position, as I have said before, corresponds to thelast step but one in the development of the harpoon-head. When theblade is of flint and inserted with a tang, the tip of the body isalways whipped with sinew braid, as in Fig. 212, No. 89748 [928], fromNuwŭk. This specimen is remarkable as being the only one in the serieswith a double point to the barb. These bodies are sometimes ornamentedwith incised lines, in conventional patterns, as shown in thedifferent figures. A short incised mark somewhat resembling an arrow(see above, Fig. 234, No. 89747 [1044]) may have some significance asit is repeated on several of the heads. Harpoon-heads of this peculiarpattern are to be found in the Museum collection from otherlocalities. As we should naturally expect, they have been found at theDiomede Islands, St. Lawrence Island, and Plover Bay. It is veryinteresting, however, to find a specimen of precisely the same typefrom Greenland, where the modern harpoons are so different from thoseused in the west.  [Illustration: FIG. 235.--Whale harpoon heads. 1/3]That the line connecting the head with the float line is not always solong in proportion as represented on the two models is shown by Fig.236, No. 89744 [969], the only specimen obtained with any part of theline attached. A piece of stout walrus-hide thong 2 feet long ispassed through the line-hole and doubled in two equal parts, which arefirmly stopped together with sinew about 2 inches from the head.Another piece of similar thong 4 feet 2 inches long is also doubledinto two equal parts and the ends firmly spliced to those of the shortpiece thus: The two ends of the long piece are slit and one end of theshort piece passed through each slit. One of these ends is then slitand through it are passed the other end of the short piece and thebight of the long piece, and all is drawn taut and securely seizedwith sinew. The becket thus formed was probably looped directly intothe bight of the float line.  [Illustration: FIG. 236.--Whale harpoon head with a “leader.” 1/4]The foreshaft is much larger than that of the model, though of thesame shape. No. 56537 [97], Fig. 237, from Utkiavwĭñ, is ofwalrus-ivory and 15.8 inches long with a diameter of 1½ inches at thebutt. The oblong slot at the beginning of the chamfer is to receivethe end of the lashing which secured this to the shaft. This form offoreshaft is very well adapted to insure the unshipping of thetoggle-head, but lacks the special advantage of the loose-shaft,namely, that under a violent lateral strain it unships withoutbreaking. The question at once suggests itself, why was not theimprovement that is used on all the other harpoons applied to thisone? In my opinion, the reason for this is the same as for retainingthe form of toggle-head, which, as I have shown, is of an ancientpattern.  [Illustration: FIG. 237.--Foreshaft of whale harpoon. 1/4]That is to say, the modern whale harpoon is the same pattern that wasonce used for all harpoons, preserved for superstitious reasons. It isa well known fact, that among many peoples implements, ideas, andlanguage have been preserved in connection with religious ceremonieslong after they have gone out of use in every-day life. Now, the whalefishing at Port Barrow, in many respects the most importantundertaking in the life of the natives, is so surrounded bysuperstitious observances, ceremonies to be performed, and otherthings of the same nature as really to assume a distinctly religiouscharacter. Hence, we should naturally expect to find the implementsused in it more or less archaic in form. That this is the case inregard to the toggle-head I think I have already shown. It seems to meequally evident that this foreshaft, which contains the loose shaftand foreshaft, undifferentiated, is also the older form.Why the development of the harpoon was arrested at this particularstage is not so easily determined. A natural supposition would be thatthis was the form of harpoon used by their ancestors when they firstbegan to be successful whalemen.That they connect the idea of good luck with these ancient stoneharpoons is shown by what occurred at Point Barrow in 1883. Of lateyears they have obtained from the ships many ordinary “whale-irons,”and some people at least had got into the habit of using them.Now, the bad luck of the season of 1882, when the boats of bothvillages together caught only one small whale, was attributed to theuse of these “irons,” and it was decided by the elders that the_first_ harpoon struck into the whale must be a stone-bladed one suchas their forefathers used when they killed many whales.In this connection, it is interesting to note a parallel customobserved at Point Hope. Hooper[N338] says that at this place thebeluga must always be struck with a _flint_ spear, even if it has beenkilled by a rifle shot.    [Footnote N338: Corwin Report, p. 41.]  [Illustration: FIG. 238.--Whale lance.]_Lances._--As I have said on a preceding page, some of the natives nowuse bomb-guns for dispatching the harpooned whale, and all thewhaleboats are provided with steel whale lances obtained from theships. In former times they used a large and powerful lance with abroad flint head. They seem to have continued the use of this weapon,probably for the same reasons that led them to retain the ancientharpoon for whaling until they obtained their present supply of steellances, as we found no signs of iron whale lances of nativemanufacture, such as are found in Greenland and elsewhere. We obtainednine heads for stone lances (kaluwiɐ) and one complete lance, a veryfine specimen (No. 56765 [537], Fig. 238), which was brought down as apresent from Nuwŭk. The broad, sharp head is of light gray flint,mounted on a shaft of spruce 12 feet 6 inches long. It has a broad,stout tang inserted in the cleft end of the shaft. The shaft isrhomboidal in section with rounded edges, and tapers from a breadth of2 inches and a thickness of 1 at the tip to a butt of 0.7 inch broadand 1 thick. The tip of the shaft has a whipping of sinew-braid 1¾inches deep, “kackled” down on both edges, one end of the twine oneach edge, so that the hitch made by one end crosses the round turn ofthe other, making in all twenty-six turns. The shaft has been paintedred for 1½ inches below the whipping.  [Illustration: FIG. 239.--Flint head of whale lance. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 240.--Flint heads for whale lances.]No. 89596 [1032] is the head and 5 inches of the shaft of a similarlance. The head is of black flint, and the sinew-braid forms a simplewhipping. The remaining heads are all unmounted. I have figuredseveral of them to show the variations of this now obsolete weapon.Fig. 239, No. 56677 [49], from Utkiavwĭñ, is of gray flint chipped inlarge flakes. The total length is 6.9 inches. The small lugs on theedges of the tang are to keep it from slipping out of the whipping.No. 56679 [239], also from Utkiavwĭñ, is of black flint and broaderthan the preceding. Its length is 6.3 inches. No. 56680 [394], fromthe same village, is of light bluish gray flint and very broad. It is5.4 inches long. No. 56681 [5], from Utkiavwĭñ, is another broad headof black flint, 6 inches long. Fig. 240_a_, No. 89597 [1034], fromNuwŭk, is of black flint, and unusually long in proportion, runninginto the tang with less shoulder than usual. Much of the originalsurface is left untouched on one face. This is probably very old. No.89598 [1361] is a head of similar shape of dark gray flint fromSidaru. It is 6 inches long. Fig. 240_b_, No. 89599 [1373], from thesame place and of similar material, is shaped very like the head of asteel lance. It is 5 inches long. Fig. 240_c_, No. 89600 [1069], fromUtkiavwĭñ, is still broader in proportion and almost heart-shaped. Itis of bluish gray flint and 4.8 inches long. These heads probablyrepresent most of the different forms in use. Only two types are to berecognized among them, the long-pointed oval with a short tang, andthe broad leaf-shaped head with a rather long tang, which appears tobe the commoner form.We obtained one newly made lance of a pattern similar to the above,but smaller, which was said to be a model of the weapon used inattacking the polar bear before the introduction of firearms. Thename, pû´nnû, is curiously like the name panna given by Dr. Simpsonand Capt. Parry to the large double-edged knife. The specimen, No.89895 [1230], Fig. 241, came from Utkiavwĭñ. It has a head of grayflint 3½ inches long, exclusive of the tang, roughly convex on oneface, but flat and merely beveled at the edges on the other. The edgesare finely serrate. The shaft is of spruce, 6 feet 8 inches long,rounded and somewhat flattened at the tip, which is 1 inch wide andtapering to a diameter of 0.7 at the butt, and is painted red withocher. The tip has a slight shoulder to keep the whipping in place.The tang is wedged in with bits of leather and secured by a closewhipping of sinew braid 1¼ inches deep. Fig. 242, No. 89611 [1034],from Nuwŭk, was probably the head of such a lance, although it issomewhat narrower and slightly shorter. Its total length is 3.4inches. The other two large lance-heads, No. 56708_a_ [114_a_] and No.56708_b_ [114_b_], are both new, but were probably meant for the bearlance. They are of gray flint, 3½ inches long, and have the edgesregularly serrate.  [Illustration: FIG. 241.--Bear lance. 1/12]  [Illustration: FIG. 242.--Flint head for bear lance. 1/2]One form of lance is still in general use. It has a sharp metal head,and a light wooden shaft about 6 feet long. It is used in the kaiakfor stabbing deer swimming in the water, after the manner frequentlynoticed among other Eskimo.[N339] A pair of these spears is carried inbeckets on the forward deck of the kaiak. On approaching a deer one ofthem is slipped out of the becket and laid on the deck, with the buttresting on the combing of the cockpit. The hunter then paddles rapidlyup alongside of the deer, grasps the lance near the butt, as he woulda dagger, and stabs the animal with a quick downward thrust. Thisspear is called kă´pun, which in the Point Barrow dialect exactlycorresponds to the Greenlandic word kapût, which is applied to thelong-bladed spear or long knife used for dispatching a harpoonedseal.[N340] The word kă´pun means simply “an instrument for stabbing.”    [Footnote N339: Parry, 2d Voy., p. 512 (Iglulik); Kumlien,    Contributions, p. 54 (Cumberland Gulf); Schwatka, Science, vol. 4,    No. 98, p. 544 (King Williams Land).]    [Footnote N340: Crantz, vol. 1, p. 147, Pl. V, Fig. 5; and Kane,    1st Grinnell Exp., p. 479 (fig. at bottom).]  [Illustration: FIG. 243.--Deer Lance. 1/12 1/3]  [Illustration: FIG. 244.--Part of deer lance, with flint head. 1/2]No. 73183 [524], Figs. 243_a_, 243_b_ (head enlarged), will serve as atype of this weapon, of which we have two specimens. All that we sawwere essentially like this. The head is iron, 4¾ inches long exclusiveof the tang, and 1½ inches broad. The edges are narrowly beveled onboth faces. The shaft is 6 feet 2 inches long, and tapers from adiameter of 0.8 inch about the middle to about one-half inch at eachend. The tip is cleft to receive the tang of the head, and shoulderedto keep the whipping from slipping off. The latter was of sinew braidand 2 inches deep. The shaft is painted with red ocher. The other hasa shaft 6 feet 4 inches long, but otherwise resembles the preceding.The heads for these lances are not always made of iron. Copper, brass,etc., are sometimes used. No. 56699 [166] is one of a pair of neatlymade copper lance heads. It is 5.9 inches long and 1½ wide, and grounddown on each face to a sharp edge without a bevel, except just at thepoint. Before the introduction of iron these lances had stone heads,but were otherwise of the same shape. Fig. 244 represents the head and6 inches of the shaft of one of these (No. 89900 [1157] from Nuwŭk).The shaft is new and rather carelessly made of a rough, knotty pieceof spruce, and is 5 feet 5¾ inches long. The head is of black flintand 2 inches long, exclusive of the tang, and the tip of the shaft iswhipped with a narrow strip of light-colored whalebone, the end ofwhich is secured by passing it through a slit in the side of the shaftand wedging it into a crack on the opposite side. This is an old headnewly mounted for the market, and the head is wedged in with a bit ofblue flannel.No. 89897 [1324], Fig. 245, from Utkiavwĭñ, on the other hand, is anold shaft 5 feet 7½ inches long, fitted with a new head, which is verybroad, and shaped like the head of a bear lance. It is of variegatedjasper, brown and gray, and has a piece of white sealskin lapped overthe cleft of the shaft at each side of the tang so that the edges ofthe two pieces almost meet in the middle. They are secured by a spacedwhipping of sinew braid. This shaft, which is painted red, evidentlyhad a broad head formerly, as it is expanded at the tip. No. 89896[1324] is the mate to this, evidently made to match it. We alsoobtained one other flint-headed lance. The mate to No. 89900 [1157],No. 89898 [1157], has a head of dark gray slate 2.3 inches long. Thisspear appears to be wholly old, except the whipping of sinew braid.The shaft is of spruce, 5 feet 4¾ inches long, and painted red withocher. We also collected three stone heads for such lances. Fig. 246,No. 38711 [148], from Utkiavwĭñ, shows the shape of the tang. It is ofgray flint, and 3.7 inches long. No. 89610 [1154] is a beautiful lancehead of polished olive green jade, 4.3 inches long. The hole in thetang is probably not intended for a rivet, as none of the lance headswhich we saw were fastened in this way. It is more likely that it wasperforated for attaching it to the belt as an amulet. We were toldthat this lance head was brought from the west. A large slate lancehead found by Nordenskiöld[N341] in the old “Onkilon” house at NorthCape is of precisely the same shape as these deer-lance heads, butfrom its size was probably intended for a whale lance.    [Footnote N341: Vega, vol. 1, p. 444, Fig. 7.]  [Illustration: FIG. 245.--Deer lance, flint head. 1/12]  [Illustration: FIG. 246.--Flint head for deer lance. 1/2]THROWING WEAPONS.The only throwing weapon which these people use is a small bolas,designed for catching birds on the wing. This consists of six or sevensmall ivory balls, each attached to a string about 30 inches long, theends of which are fastened together to a tuft of feathers, whichserves as a handle and perhaps directs the flight of the missile. Whennot in use the strings are shortened up, as in Fig. 247, No. 75969[1793], for convenience in carrying and to keep them from tangling, bytying them into slip knots, as follows: All the strings beingstraightened out and laid parallel to each other, they are doubled ina bight, with the end under the standing part, the bight of the endpassed through the preceding bight, which is drawn up close, and soon, usually five or six times, till the strings are sufficientlyshortened. A pull on the two ends slips all these knots and thestrings come out straight and untangled.The bolas is carried knotted up in a pouch slung round the neck,a native frequently carrying several sets. When a flock of ducks isseen approaching, the handle is grasped in the right hand, the ballsin the left, and the strings are straightened out with a quick pull.Letting go with the left hand the balls are whirled round the head andlet fly at the passing flock. The balls spread apart in flying throughthe air, so as to cover considerable space, like a charge of shot, andif they are stopped by striking a duck, the strings immediately wraparound him and hamper his flight so that he comes to the ground. Thenatives said that the balls flew with sufficient force to stun a duckor break his wing, but we never happened to see any taken except inthe way just described. A duck is occasionally left with sufficientfreedom of motion to escape with the bolas hanging to him. The weaponis effective up to 30 or 40 yards, but the natives often throw it to alonger distance, frequently missing their aim. It is universallyemployed, especially by those who have no guns, and a good many ducksare captured with it. In the spring, when the ducks are flying, thewomen and children hardly ever stir out of the house without one ormore of these.  [Illustration: FIG. 247.--Bird bolas, looped up for carrying. 1/4]  [Illustration: FIG. 248.--Bird bolas, ready for use. 1/6]We brought home one specimen of this implement (kelauĭtau´tĭn), No.75969 [1793], Fig. 248, which is new and has the balls rathercarelessly made. The balls, which are six in number, are of walrusivory, 1.6 to 1.8 inches long and 1 inch in diameter (except one whichis flattened, 2 inches long and 1.3 wide; they are usually all of thesame shape). Through the larger end is drilled a small hole, the endsof which are joined by a shallow groove running over the end, intowhich the ends of the strings are fastened by three half-hitches each.There is one string of sinew braid to each set of two balls, doubledin the middle so that all six parts are equal and about 28 incheslong. They are fastened to the feather handle as follows: Nine wingfeathers of the eider duck are laid side by side, butt to point, anddoubled in the middle so that the quills and vanes stand up on allsides. The middle of each string is laid across the bight of thefeathers, so that the six parts come out on all sides between thefeathers. The latter are then lashed tightly together with a bit ofsinew braid, by passing the end over the bend of the feathers andtying with the rest of the string round the feathers.These weapons are generally very much like the specimen described, butvary somewhat in the shape and material of the balls, which aresometimes simply ovoid or spherical, and often made of single teeth ofthe walrus, instead of tusk ivory. Bone is also sometimes used. Informer times, the astragalus bones of the reindeer, perforated throughthe ridge on one end were used for balls. No. 89490 [1342], is a pairof such bones tied together with a bit of thong, which appear to havebeen actually used. No. 89537 [1251] from Utkiavwĭñ is a very oldball, which is small (1.1 inches long) and unusually flat. It appearsto have been kept as a relic.There is very little information to be found concerning the extent ofthe region in which this implement is used, either in the Museumcollections or in the writings of authors. A few points, however, havebeen made out with certainty. The bolas are unknown among all theEskimo east of the Anderson River, and the only evidence that we haveof their use at this point is an entry in the Museum catalogue, towhich I have been unable to find a corresponding specimen. Dease andSimpson, in 1837, did not observe them till they reached PointBarrow.[N342] They were first noticed by Beechey at Kotzebue Sound in1826.[N343] Mr. Nelson’s collections show that they are used fromPoint Barrow along the Alaskan coast, at least as far south as theYukon delta, and on St. Lawrence Island, while for their use on thecoast of Siberia as far as Cape North, we have the authority ofNordenskiöld,[N344] and the Krause Brothers.[N345]    [Footnote N342: T. Simpson’s Narrative, p. 156.]    [Footnote N343: Voyage, p. 574.]    [Footnote N344: Vega, vol. 2, p. 109, and Fig. 3, p. 105.]    [Footnote N345: Geographische Blätter, vol. 5, pt. 1, p. 32. See    also Rosse, Arctic Cruise of the Corwin, p. 34.]HUNTING IMPLEMENTS OTHER THAN WEAPONS._Floats._--I have already spoken of the floats (apotû´kpûñ) ofinflated sealskin used in capturing the whale and walrus. We obtainedone specimen, No. 73578 [538] Fig. 249. This is the whole skin, exceptthe head, of a male rough seal (Phoca fœtida), with the hair out. Thecarcass was carefully removed without making any incision except roundthe neck and a few inches down the throat, and skinned to the verytoes, leaving the claws on. All natural or accidental apertures arecarefully sewed up, except the genital opening, into which is inserteda ring of ivory, which serves as a mouthpiece for inflating the skinand is corked with a plug of wood. The cut in the throat is carefullysewed up, and the neck puckered together, and wrapped with seal thonginto a slender shank about 1 inch long, leaving a flap of skin whichis wrapped round a rod of bone 4 inches long and 1 in diameter, setacross the shank, and wound with thong. This makes a handle forlooping on the harpoon line.  [Illustration: FIG. 249.--Seal skin float. 1/12]All the floats used at Point Barrow are of the same general pattern asthis, and are generally made of the skin of the rough seal, thoughskins of the harbor seal (P. vitulina) are sometimes used. One ofthese floats is attached to the walrus harpoon, but two are used inwhaling.[N346] Five or six floats are carried in each boat, and areinflated before starting out. I have seen them used for seats during ahalt on the ice, when the boat was being taken out to the “lead.” Theuse of these large floats is not peculiar to Point Barrow. They areemployed by all Eskimo who pursue the larger marine mammals.    [Footnote N346: I learn from our old interpreter, Capt. E.P.    Herendeen, who has spent three years in whaling at Point Barrow    since the return of the expedition, that a third float is also    used. It is attached by a longer line than the others, and serves    as a sort of “telltale,” coming to the surface some time ahead of    the whale.]_Flipper toggles._--We collected two pairs of peculiar implements, inthe shape of ivory whales about 5 inches long, with a perforation inthe belly through which a large thong could be attached. We understoodthat they were to be fastened to the ends of a stout thong and usedwhen a whale was killed to toggle his flippers together so as to keepthem in place while towing him to the ice, by cutting holes in theflippers and passing the ivory through. We unfortunately never had anopportunity of verifying this story. Neither pair is new. Fig. 250_a_represents a pair of these implements (kă´gotĭñ) (No. 56580 [227]).They are of white walrus ivory. In the middle of each belly isexcavated a deep, oblong cavity about three-fourths of an inch longand one-half wide, across the middle of which is a stout transversebar for the attachment of the line. One is a “bow-head” whale (Balænamysticetus), 4½ inches long, and the other evidently intended for a“California gray” (Rhachinectes glaucus). It has light blue glassbeads inserted for eyes and is the same length as the other.Fig. 250 (No. 56598 [407]) is a similar pair, which are both“bowheads” nearly 5 inches long. Both have cylindrical plugs of ivoryinserted for eyes, and are made of a piece of ivory so old that thesurface is a light chocolate color. The name, kăgotĭñ, means literally“a pair of toggles.”_Harpoon boxes (u´dlun or u´blun, literally “a nest.”)_--The slateharpoon blades already described were very apt to be lost or broken,so they always carried in the boat a supply of spare blades. Thesewere kept in a small box carved out of a block of soft wood, in theshape of the animal to be pursued.  [Illustration: FIG. 250.--Flipper toggles. 2/3]Fig. 251_a_ represents one of these boxes (No. 56505 [138]) intendedfor spare blades for the whale harpoon. This is rather neatly carvedfrom a single block of soft wood, apparently spruce, though it is veryold and much weathered, in the shape of a “bowhead” whale, 9½ incheslong. The ends of the flukes are broken short off, and show traces ofhaving been mended with wooden pegs or dowels. The right eye isindicated by a simple incision, but a tiny bit of crystal is inlaidfor the left. Two little bits of crystal are also inlaid in the middleof the back. The belly is flat and excavated into a deep triangularcavity, with its base just forward of the angle of the mouth and theapex at the “small.” It is beveled round the edge, with a shoulder atthe base and apex, and is covered with a flat triangular piece of woodbeveled on the under face to fit the edge of the cavity. About half ofone side of the cover has been split off and mended on with two“stitches” of whalebone fiber. The cover is held on by three stringsof seal thong passing through holes in each corner of the cover andsecured by a knot in the end of each string. They then pass throughthree corresponding holes in the bottom of the cavity, leaving outsideof the back two ends 7 inches and one 15 long, which are tiedtogether. The cover can be lifted wholly off and then drawn back intoits place by pulling the string.  [Illustration: FIG. 251.--Boxes for harpoon heads. 1/3]We collected seven such whale-harpoon boxes, usually about 9 to 9¾inches long. Nearly all have bits of crystal, amber, or pyrite, inlaidfor the eyes and in the middle of the back, and the cover is generallyrigged in the way described. No. 56502 [198], from Utkiavwĭñ, is alarge whale, a foot long, and has the tail bent up, while the animalis usually represented as if lying still. It has good-sized sky-bluebeads inlaid for the eyes.Fig. 251_b_ (No. 89733 [1161], from Nuwŭk) represents a small box 4⅓inches long, probably older than the others, and the only one notcarved into the shape of a whale. It is roughly egg-shaped and has nowooden cover to the cavity, which is covered with a piece of deerskin,held on by a string of seal thong wrapped three times around the bodyin a rough, deep groove, with the end tucked under. In this box arefive slate blades for the whale harpoon.We also collected two boxes for walrus harpoons made in the shape ofthe walrus, with ivory or bone tusks. No. 89732 [860], Fig. 251_c_,from Nuwŭk, is old, and 7 inches long, and has two oval bits of ivory,with holes bored to represent the pupils, inlaid for the eyes. Thereis no cover, but the cavity is filled with a number of slate blades,carefully packed in whalebone shavings. There is a little eyebolt ofivory at each end of the cavity. One end of a bit of sinew braid istied to the anterior of these, and the other carried down through thehinder one, and then brought up and fastened round the body with amarling hitch. The other, No. 56489 [127], is new and rather roughlymade, 5 inches long and painted all over with red ocher. It has acover, but no strings.No. 56501 [142], Fig. 251_d_, from Utkiavwĭñ, is for carrying harpoonblades for the chase of the bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), and isneatly carved into the shape of that animal. It is 7.4 inches long andhas ivory eyes like the walrus box, No. 89732 [860]. The cover isfitted to the cavity like those of the whale boxes, but is held on byone string only, a piece of seal thong about 3 feet long passingthrough the middle of the cover and out at a hole on the left side,about one-fourth inch from the cavity. The box is filled with raveledrope-yarns. Fig. 251_e_ (No. 89730 [981], from Utkiavwĭñ) is likethis, but very large, 9.3 inches long. The cover is thick and a littlelarger than the cavity, beveled on the upper face and notched on eachside to receive the string, which is a bit of sinew braid fastened totwo little ivory hooks, one on each side of the body. It is fastenedto the right hook, carried across and hooked around the left-hand one,then carried over and hooked round the other, and secured by tucking abight of the end under the last part. The box contains several slateblades. We also collected one other large seal box (No. 89731 [859],from Nuwŭk), very roughly carved, and 9.8 inches long. The cover isfitted into the cavity and held on by a narrow strip of whalebonerunning across in a transverse groove in the cover and through a holein each side of the box._Nets (ku´bra)._--The smaller seals are captured in large-meshed netsof rawhide. We brought home one of these, No. 56756 [109], Figs252_a_-252_b_ (detail of mesh). This is a rectangular net, eighteenmeshes long and twelve deep, netted of fine seal thong with theordinary netting knot. The length of the mesh is 14 inches.  [Illustration: FIG. 252.--Seal net. 1/36 1/4]Such nets are set under the ice in winter, or in shoal water along theshore by means of stakes in summer. In the ordinary method of settingthe net under the ice two small holes are cut through the ice thelength of the net apart, and between them in the same straight line iscut a third large enough to permit a seal to be drawn up through it.A line with a plummet on the end is let down through one of the smallholes, and is hooked through the middle hole, with a long slender poleof willow, often made of several pieces spliced together, with a smallwooden hook on the end. The line is then detached from the plummet andfastened to one upper corner of the net, and a second line is let downthrough the other small hole and made fast in the same way to theother upper corner. By pulling on these lines the net is drawn downthrough the middle and stretched like a curtain under the ice, while aline at the middle serves to haul it up again. The end lines are butloosely made fast to lumps of ice, so that when a seal strikes the netnothing hinders his wrapping it completely around him in his strugglesto escape. When the hunter, who is usually watching his net, thinksthe seal is sufficiently entangled he hauls him up through the largehole and sets the net again.I had no opportunity of observing whether any weights or plummets wereused to keep down the lower edge of the net. These nets are nowuniversally employed, but one native spoke of a time “long ago” whenthere were no nets and they captured seals with the spear (u´nɐ)alone. The net was used in seal catching in Dr. Simpson’s time, thoughhe makes but a casual reference to it,[N347] and Beechey found sealnets at Kotzebue Sound in 1826.[N348] The net is very generally usedfor sealing among the Eskimo of western America and in Siberia. Weobserved seal nets set with stakes along the shore of the sandspit atPlover Bay, and Nordenskiöld speaks of seal nets “set in summer amongthe ground ices along the shore,”[N349] and at open leads in thewinter, but gives no description of the method of setting these netsbeyond mentioning the “long pole which was used in setting thenet,”[N350] as none of his party ever witnessed the sealfishery.[N351] I am informed by Mr. W. H. Dall that the winter nets inNorton Sound are not set under the ice as at Point Barrow, but withstakes in shoal water wherever there are open holes in the ice. “Icenets” are spoken of as in use for sealing in Greenland, but I havebeen able to find no description of them. As they are not spoken of byeither Egede or Crantz I am inclined to believe that they wereintroduced by the Europeans.[N352] Mr. L. M. Turner informs me thatsuch is the case at Ungava Bay on the southern shore of Hudson Strait,where they use a very long net set under the ice very much as at PointBarrow. I can find no mention of the use of seal nets among any otherof the eastern Eskimo.    [Footnote N347: Op. cit., p. 262.]It is well known that seals have a great deal of curiosity, and areeasily attracted by any unusual sounds, especially if they are gentleand long-continued. It is therefore easy to entice them into the netsby making such noises, for instance, gentle whistling, rattling on theice with the pick, and so forth. Two special implements are also usedfor this purpose. The first kind I have called:    [Footnote N348: Voyage, pp. 295, 574.]    [Footnote N349: Vega, vol. 2, p. 108.]    [Footnote N350: Ibid., p. 98.]    [Footnote N351: See also the reference to Hooper’s Corwin Report,    quoted below under Hunting.]    [Footnote N352: See, however, the writer’s paper in the American    Anthropologist, vol. 1, p. 333.]_Seal calls_ (adrigautĭn).--This implement consists of three or fourclaws mounted on the end of a short wooden handle, and is used to makea gentle noise by scratching on the ice. It is a common implement,though I never happened to see it in use. We obtained six specimens,of which No. 56555 [90] Fig. 253_a_, is the type. It is 11½ incheslong. The round handle is of ash, the claws are those of the beardedseal, secured by a lashing of sinew braid, with the end brought downon the under side to a little blunt, backward-pointing hook of ivory,set into the wood about 1 inch from the base of the arms.Fig. 253_b_ (No. 56557 [93] from Utkiavwĭñ is 9½ inches long and hasfour prongs. The haft is of spruce, and instead of an ivory hook thereis a round-headed stud of the same material, which is driven whollythrough the wood, having the point cut off flush with the uppersurface. It has a lanyard of seal twine knotted into the hole in thehaft. The other two specimens of this pattern, Nos. 56556 [100] and56558 [51] have each three claws, and hafts of soft wood, painted withred ocher, with lanyards, and are respectively 10.4 and 10.7 incheslong. One has an ivory hook, but the other in place of this has asmall iron nail, and is ornamented with a medium-sized sky-blue glassbead inlaid in the back. The other two are both new and small, beingrespectively 7.5 and 7.6 inches long. The hafts are made of reindeerantler and have only two prongs. No. 89467 [1312] from Utkiavwĭñ, hasthe haft notched on each side, and has an irregular stud of bone forsecuring the lashing.  [Illustration: FIG. 253.--Scratchers for decoying seals.]No. 89468 [1354], Fig. 253_c_, from Utkiavwĭñ, has no stud and theclaws are simply held on by a slight lashing of twisted sinew. Both ofthese were made for the market, but may be models of a form once used.There are two old seal calls in the Museum from near St. Michaels,made of a piece of reindeer antler, apparently the spreading browantler, in which the sharp points of the antler take the place ofclaws. The use of this implement, as shown by Mr. Nelson’s collection,extends or extended from Point Barrow to Norton Sound. He collectedspecimens from St. Lawrence Island and Cape Wankarem in Siberia.Nordenskiöld speaks of the use of this implement at Pitlekaj andfigures a specimen.[N353] The other instrument appears to be lesscommon. I have called it a seal rattle.    [Footnote N353: Vega, vol. 2, p. 117, Fig. 3.]_Seal rattle._--We obtained only two specimens, No. 56533 [409], whichseem to be a pair. Fig. 254 is one of these. It is of cottonwood and 4inches long, roughly carved into the shape of a seal’s head andpainted red, with two small transparent blue glass beads inlaid forthe eyes. The neat becket of seal thong consists of three or fourturns with the end wrapped spirally around them. The staple on whichthe ivory pendants hang is of iron. This is believed to be a rattle tobe shaken on the ice by a string tied to the becket for the purpose ofattracting seals to the ice net. It was brought in for sale at a timeduring our first year when we were very busy with zoological work, andas something was said about “nĕtyĭ” and “kubra” (“seal” and “net”) thecollector concluded that they must be floats for seal nets, and theywere accordingly catalogued as such and laid away. We never happenedto see another specimen, and as these were sent home in 1882 welearned no more of their history. The late Dr. Emil Bessels, however,on my return called my attention to the fact that in the museum atCopenhagen there is a single specimen very similar to these, which wassaid to have been used in the manner described above. It came fromsomewhere in eastern America. There is one, he told me, in the BritishMuseum from Bering Strait. The National Museum contains severalspecimens collected by Mr. Nelson at Point Hope. It is very probablethat this is the correct explanation of the use of these objects, asit assigns a function to the ivory pendants which would otherwise beuseless. They have been called “dog bells,” but the Eskimo, at PointBarrow, at least, are not in the habit of marking their dogs in anyway.  [Illustration: FIG. 254.--Seal rattle. 1/2]_Seal indicators._--When watching for a seal at his breathing hole anative inserts in the hole a slender rod of ivory, which is heldloosely in place by a cross piece or a bunch of feathers on the end.When the seal rises he pushes up this rod, which is so light that hedoes not notice it, and thus warns the hunter when to shoot or strikewith his spear. Most of the seal hunting was done at such a distancefrom the station that I remember only one occasion when this implementwas seen in use. We collected two specimens, of which No. 56507 [104],Fig. 255_a_, will serve as the type. It is of walrus ivory, 14½ incheslong and 0.3 in diameter, with a small lanyard of sinew. The curvedcross piece of ivory, 1⅓ inches long, is inserted into a slotone-fourth of an inch from the end and secured by a little treenail ofwood.Fig. 255_b_ (No. 89454 [1114], from Nuwŭk) is a similar indicator, 13½inches long and flat (0.3 inch wide and 0.1 thick). The upper end iscarved into scallops for ornament and has a small eye into which wasknotted a bit of whalebone fiber. The tip is beveled off with aconcave bevel on both faces to a sharp edge, so that it can be usedfor a “feather setter” (ĭgugwau) in feathering arrows. Such implementsare mentioned in most popular accounts of the Eskimo of the east, andCapt. Parry describes it from personal observation at Iglulik.[N354]I have been unable to find any mention of its use in western America,and have seen no specimens in the National Museum.  [Illustration: FIG. 255.--Seal indicators. 1/4]_Sealing stools._--When a native is watching a seal-hole he frequentlyhas to stand for hours motionless on the ice. His feet would becomeexceedingly cold, in spite of the excellence of his foot covering,were it not for a little three-legged stool about 10 inches high uponwhich he stands. This stool is made of wood, with a triangular topjust large enough to accommodate a man’s feet, with the heels togetherover one leg of the stool, and the other two legs supporting the toesof each foot, respectively. The stool is neatly made, and is as lightas is consistent with strength. It is universally employed and carriedby the hunter, slung on the gun cover with the legs projecting behind.  [Illustration: FIG. 256.--Sealing stool. 1/4]When the hunter has a long time to wait he generally squats down so asalmost to sit on his heels, holding his gun and spear in readiness,and wholly covered with one of the deerskin cloaks already described.They sometimes use this stool to sit on when waiting for ducks to flyover the ice in the spring.    [Footnote N354: Second Voyage, p. 510; also pl. opposite p. 550,    Fig. 17.]We brought home two specimens of this common object (nĭgawaúotĭn). No.89887 [1411], Fig. 250, will serve as the type. The top is of spruce,8¾ inches long and 10¾ wide. The upper surface is flat and smooth, thelower broadly beveled off on the edges and deeply excavated in themiddle, so that there are three straight ridges joining the threelegs, each of which stands in the middle of a slight prominence. Theobject of cutting away the wood in this way is to make the stoollighter, leaving it thick only at the points where the pressure comes.The large round hole in the middle, near the front, is for conveniencein picking it up and hanging it on the cache frame, where it isgenerally kept. The three legs are set into holes at each corner,spreading out so as to stand on a base larger than the top of thestool. Where they fit into the holes they are 0.7 inch in diameter,tapered slightly to fit the hole, and then tapering down to a diameterof one-third inch at the tip. On the under side of the top they arebraced with a lashing of stout seal thong. A split on the right-handedge of the top has been mended, as usual, with a stitch of whalebone.This stool is quite old and has been actually used.No. 89888 [1412], from the same village, is new and a little larger,but differs from the type only in having a triangular instead of around hole in the top and no lashing. Those of our party who landed atSidaru September 7, 1881, saw one of these stools hanging up in thethen vacant village, and there is a precisely similar stool in theMuseum from the Anderson region.MacFarlane, in his manuscript notes, describes the use of these stoolsas follows: “Both tribes kill seals under ice; that is, they watch forthem at their holes (breathing) or wherever open water appears. At theformer they generally build a small snow house somewhat like asentinel’s box, on the bottom of which they fix a portablethree-cornered stool, made of wood. They stand on this and therebyescape getting cold feet, as would be the case were they to remain forany time on ice or snow in the same immovable position.” Beyond this Ifind no mention of the use of any such a utensil, east or west, exceptin Greenland, where, however, they used a sort of one-legged chair tosit on, as well as a footstool, which Egede pictures (Pl. 9) as oval,with very short legs.[N355]    [Footnote N355: “They first look out for Holes, which the Seals    themselves make with their Claws about the Bigness of a Halfpenny;    after they have found any Hole, they seat themselves near it upon    a Chair, made for the Purpose; and as soon as they perceive the    Seal coming up to the Hole and put his snout into it for some Air,    they immediately strike him with a small Harpoon.” Egede,    Greenland, p. 104.    “The seals themselves make sometimes holes in the Ice, where they    come and draw breath; near such a hole a Greenlander seats himself    on a stool, putting his feet on a lower one to keep them from the    cold. Now when the seal comes and puts its nose to the hole, he    pierces it instantly with his harpoon.” Crantz, History of    Greenland, vol. 1, p. 156.]_Seal drags (uksiu´tiñ.)_--Every seal hunter carries with him a linefor dragging home his game, consisting of a stout thong doubled in abight about 18 inches long, with an ivory handle or knob at the otherend. The bight is looped into an incision in the seal’s lower jaw,while the knob serves for attaching a longer line or the end of adog’s harness. The seal is dragged on his back and runs as smoothly asa sled. We collected eight of these drag lines, from which I haveselected No. 56624 [44], Fig. 257_a_, as the type.  [Illustration: FIG. 257.--Seal drags and handles. 1/2]This consists of a stout thong of rawhide (the skin of the beardedseal) 0.3 inch wide and 37 inches long, and doubled in a bight so thatone end is about 2½ inches the longer. These ends are fastened into ahandle of walrus ivory, consisting of three pieces, namely: a pair ofneatly carved mittens, respectively 1.9 and 1.8 inches long, puttogether wrist to wrist with the palms up; and lying across the jointabove, a little seal 1¼ inches long, belly down. A hole runs througheach wrist and through the belly of the seal. The mittens areornamented on the back with a blackened incised pattern, and the sealhas blue glass beads for eyes and blackened incised spots on the back.The longer end of the thong runs up through the right mitten, acrossthrough the seal, and down through the left mitten. It is then passedthrough a slit 1 inch from the end of the shorter part and slititself. Through this slit is passed the bight of the thong, all drawnup taut and seized with sinew braid.No. 89467 [755], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a similar drag, put together inmuch the same way, but it has the mittens doweled together with twowooden pins, and a seal’s head with round bits of wood inlaid foreyes, ears, and nostrils, in place of the seal. The longitudinalperforation in this head shows that it was originally strunglengthwise on one of these lines. The “double slit splice” of the twoends of the thong is worked into a complicated round knot, betweenwhich and the handle the two parts of the line are confined by a tubeof ivory 1 inch long, ornamented with deeply incised patterns. Fig.257_b_ is the upper part of a line (No. 56622 [36], from Utkiavwĭñ),with a similar tube 1¾ inches long, and a handle carved from a singlepiece into a pair of mittens like the others.No. 56625 [81], also from Utkiavwĭñ, is almost exactly similar to theone first described, but has the seal belly up. Fig. 257_c_ (No. 89470[1337], from the same village) has a seal 2.3 inches long for thehandle, and No. 56626 [212], from Utkiavwĭñ, is like it. No. 89469_a_,[755_a_] Fig. 257_d_, from Utkiavwĭñ, has for a handle the head of abearded seal 1.6 inches long, neatly carved from walrus ivory, withround bits of wood inlaid for the eyes and ears. It is perforatedlongitudinally from the chin to the back of the head, and a large holeat the throat opens into this. The longer end of the thong is passedin at the chin and out at the back of the head; the shorter, in at theback of the head and out at the throat; the two ends brought togetherbetween the standing parts and all stopped together with sinew braid.No. 56627 [45], Fig. 257_e_, has a handle made of two ivory bears’heads, very neatly carved, with circular bits of wood inlaid for eyes,and perforated like the seal’s head just described. The thong isdoubled in the middle and each end passed through one of the headslengthwise, so as to protrude about 7 inches. About 4 inches of end isthen doubled over, thrust through the throat hole of the oppositehead, and brought down along the standing parts. All the parts arestopped together with sinew braid. This makes a small becket above thehandle.We collected seven knobs for these drag lines, of which six are seals’heads and one a bear’s. They are all made of walrus ivory, apparentlyeach a single tooth, and not a piece of tusk, and are about 1½ inchesto 2 inches long. They are generally carved with considerable skill,and often have the ears, roots of the whiskers, nostrils, and outlineof the mouth incised and blackened, while small blue beads, bits ofivory, or wood are inlaid for the eyes. Implements of this sort are incommon use among Eskimo generally wherever they are so situated as tobe able to engage in seal-hunting. Mr. Nelson’s collection containsspecimens from as far south as Cape Darby._Whalebone wolf-killers (ĭsĭbru)._--Before the introduction of thesteel traps, which they now obtain by trade, these people used apeculiar contrivance for catching the wolf. This consists of a stoutrod of whalebone about 1 foot long and one-half inch broad, with asharp point at each end. One of these was folded lengthwise in theform of a Z,[N356] wrapped in blubber (whale’s blubber was used,according to our informant, Nĭkawáalu), and frozen solid. It was thenthrown out on the snow where the wolf could find and swallow it. Theheat of the animal’s body would thaw out the blubber, releasing thewhalebone, which would straighten out and pierce the walls of thestomach, thus causing the animal’s death. Nikawáalu says that a wolfwould not go far after swallowing one of these blubber balls.    [Footnote N356: It is twisted into “a compact helical mass like a    watch-spring” in the Hudson Bay region. Schwatka, “Nimrod in the    North,” p. 133. See also Klutschak, “Als Eskimo,” pp. 194, 195.]  [Illustration: FIG. 258.--Whalebone wolf-killers. 1/4]We collected four sets of these contrivances, one set containing sevenrods and the others four each. Fig. 258_a_ gives a good idea of theshape of one of these. It belongs to a set of seven, No. 89538 [1229],Fig. 258_b_, from Utkiavwĭñ, which are old and show the marks ofhaving been doubled up. It is 12½ inches long, 0.4 broad, and 0.2thick. The little notches on the opposite edges of each end wereprobably to hold a lashing of sinew which kept the folded rod in shapewhile the blubber was freezing, being cut by thrusting a knife throughthe partially frozen blubber, as is stated by Schwatka.[N357] Two ofthe sets are new, but made like the others.    [Footnote N357: “Nimrod in the North,” p. 133.]    [Footnote N358: See Gilder, Schwatka’s Search, p. 225; see also,    Klutschak, “Als Eskimo,” etc., pp. 194-5, where the whalebones are    said to have little knives on the ends.]This contrivance is also used by the Eskimo of Hudson Bay[N358] and atNorton Sound, where, according to Petroff,[N359] the rods are 2 feetlong and wrapped in seal blubber. The name ĭsĭ´bru appears to be thesame as the Greenlandic (isavssok), found only in the diminutiveisavssoraĸ, a provincial name for the somewhat similar sharp-pointedstick baited with blubber and used for catching gulls. The diminutiveform of this word in Greenlandic may indicate that their ancestorsonce used the large wolf-killer, when they lived where wolves werefound. The definition of uju´kuaĸ, the ordinary word for thegull-catcher (see below)--in the Grønlandske Ordbog--is the onlyevidence we have of the use of this contrivance in Greenland. This isone of the several cases in which we only learn of the occurrence ofcustoms, etc., noted at Point Barrow, in Greenland, by finding thename of the thing in question defined in the dictionary.    [Footnote N359: Report, etc., p. 127.]_Traps._--Foxes are caught in the winter by deadfalls or steel traps(nänori´a), set generally along the beach, where the foxes arewandering about in search of carrion thrown up by the sea. In settingthe deadfalls a little house about 2 feet high is built, in which isplaced the bait of meat or blubber. A heavy log of driftwood is placedacross the entrance, with one end raised high enough to allow a fox topass under it, and supported by a regular “figure of four” of sticks.The fox can not get at the bait without passing under the log, and indoing so he must touch the trigger of the “figure of four” (#4#),which brings down the log across his back. When a steel trap is usedit is not baited itself, but buried in the snow at the entrance of asimilar little house, so that the fox can not reach the bait withoutstepping on the plate of the trap and thus springing it. Many foxesare taken with such traps in the course of the winter.The boys use a sort of snare for catching setting birds. This issimply a strip of whalebone made into a slip-noose, which is set overthe eggs, with the end fastened to the ground, so that the bird iscaught by the leg. Once or twice, when there was a light snow on thebeach, we saw a native catching the large gulls as follows: He had astick of hard wood, pointed at each end, to the middle of which wasfastened one end of a stout string about 6 feet long. The other endwas secured to a stake driven into the frozen gravel, and the stickwrapped with blubber and laid on the beach, with the string carefullyhidden in the snow. The gull came along, swallowed the lump ofblubber, and as soon as he tried to fly away the string made the sharpstick turn like a toggle across his gullet, the points forcing theirway through, so that he was held fast. A similar contrivance, butsomewhat smaller and made of bone, is used at Norton Sound forcatching gulls and murres, a number of them being attached to a trawlline and baited with fish. Mr. Nelson collected a large number ofthese.[N360] In regard to the use of this contrivance in Greenland,see above under “wolf-killers.”    [Footnote N360: See Dr. Rau’s Prehistoric Fishing, p. 12. Fig. 2,    p. 13, represents one of these from Norton Sound, and Figs. 3-8,    a series of similar implements from the bone caves of France.]_Snow-goggles._--The wooden goggles worn to protect the eyes fromsnow-blindness may be considered as accessories to hunting, as theyare worn chiefly by those engaged in hunting or fishing, especiallywhen deer-hunting in the spring on the snow-covered tundra or when inthe whaleboats among the ice. They are simply a wooden cover for theeyes, admitting the light by a narrow horizontal slit, which allowsonly a small amount of light to reach the eye and at the same timegives sufficient range of vision. Such goggles are universallyemployed by the Eskimos everywhere[N361] except in Siberia, where theyuse a simple shade for the eyes.[N362]    [Footnote N361: See Parry, 2d Voyage, p. 547, Iglulik and Hudson    Strait, pl. opposite p. 548, Fig. 4, and pl. opposite p. 14;    Crantz, History of Greenland, vol. 1, p. 234; Dall, Alaska,    p. 195, figure (Norton Sound); also MacFarlane, MS., No. 2929    (Anderson River).]    [Footnote N362: Nordenskiöld, Vega, Vol. 2, p. 99.]We brought home four pairs of these goggles (í´dyĭgûñ), of which No.89894 [1708], Fig. 259, represents the common form. These are of pinewood, 5.8 inches long and 1.1 inches broad, and deeply excavated onthe inside, with a narrow horizontal slit with thin edges on each sideof the middle. In the middle are two notches to fit the nose, the onein the lower edge deep and rounded, the upper very shallow. The twoholes in each end are for strings of sinew braid to pass round thehead. They are neatly made and the outside is scraped smooth and showstraces of a coat of red ocher.  [Illustration: FIG. 259.--Wooden snow goggles. 1/2]The history of this particular pair of goggles is peculiarlyinteresting. Though differing in no important respect from those usedat the present day, they were found on the site of the ancient villageof Isû´tkwa, where our station stood, buried at a depth of 27 feet inundisturbed frozen ground, and were uncovered in digging the shaftsunk by Lieut. Ray for obtaining earth temperatures.[N363] The layerin which they were found was evidently an old sea beach, consisting ofsand and gravel mixed with broken shells, among which Mya truncata wasrecognized. The amount of the superincumbent gravel and similarmaterial above this object does not necessarily indicate any verygreat length of time since they were first buried, as will be readilyunderstood from what I have said above (p. 28) about the rapidity withwhich high hummocks of gravel are pushed up by the ice. The unbrokenlayer of turf, however, nearly a foot thick, with which the ground wascovered at this point, shows that a considerable period must haveelapsed since the gravel had reached nearly to its present level.    [Footnote N363: Report U.S. International Polar Expedition to    Point Barrow, p. 37.]The pattern of these goggles is to my mind a very decided proof thatat that early date this region was inhabited by Eskimo not essentiallydifferent from its present inhabitants. Goggles worn at the presentday are almost always of the shape of these, though I remember seeingone pair made in two pieces joined by short strings of beads acrossthe nose. They are, I think, universally painted with red ocher on theoutside and blackened inside. They were not always made of wood, asthere are two specimens in the collection made of a piece of antler,following the natural curve of the beam, divided longitudinally, withthe softer inside tissue hollowed out.  [Illustration: FIG. 260.--Bone snow goggles. 1/2]Fig. 260 (No. 89701 [763], from Utkiavwĭñ) represents one of thesespecimens. I do not recollect ever seeing goggles of this material inactual use. No. 89703 [754], Fig. 261, is an unusual pattern, havingalong the top a horizontal brim about one-half inch high, which servesfor an additional shade to the eyes. Above this are two oblique holesopening into the cavity inside, which are probably for the purpose ofventilation, to prevent the moisture from the skin from beingdeposited as frost on the inside of the goggles or on the eyelashes.I do not remember having seen such goggles worn. Dall figures asimilar pair from Norton Sound, and those brought by Mr. Turner fromUngava have a similar brim and ventilating holes. The snow gogglesmentioned in Parry’s Second Voyage (p. 547) as occasionally seen atIglulik, but more common in Hudson’s Strait, appear to have resembledthese, but had a brim 3 or 4 inches deep.  [Illustration: FIG. 261.--Wooden snow goggles, unusual form. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 262.--Marker for meat cache. 1/2]_Meat-cache markers._--We purchased a couple of little ivory rods,each with a little bunch of feathers tied to one end, which we weretold were used by the deer hunters to mark the place where they hadburied the flesh of a deer in the snow. This implement is calledtû´kusia.Fig. 262, represents one of these (No. 89531 [978] from Nuwŭk). It isa flat, slender rod of white walrus ivory, 11½ inches long, andevidently broken off at the tip. The other end is cut into ornamentalnotches, and ornamented with an incised pattern colored with redocher, consisting of conventional lines and the figure of a reindeeron each face, a buck on one face and a doe on the other. Tied by a bitof sinew to the uppermost notch are four legs and three wing tips(three or four primaries, with the skin at the base) of thebuff-breasted sandpiper (Tryngites subruficollis). This was evidentlylonger when new and perhaps was originally used for a seal indicator(which see above). Fig. 263 (No. 89453 [1581] from Utkiavwĭñ) is asimilar rod, the tip of which has been brought to an edge so that itcan be used as a “feather-setter” in feathering arrows. The remains oftwo wing tips of some small bird are tied to one of the notches at theupper end.  [Illustration: FIG. 263.--Marker for meat cache. 1/4]METHODS OF HUNTING.Having now described in detail all the weapons and other implementsused in hunting, I am prepared to give an account of the time andmethods of pursuing the different kinds of game._The polar bear._--Bears are occasionally met with in the winter bythe seal hunters, roaming about the ice fields at some distance fromthe shore. They usually run from a man and often do not make a standeven when wounded. Occasionally, however, a bear rendered bold byhunger comes in from the sea and makes an attack on some native’sstorehouse of seal meat even in the midst of the village. Of course,in such a case he has very little chance of escape, as the natives allturn out with their rifles and cut off his retreat. Two bears werekilled in this way at Utkiavwĭñ in the winter of 1882-’83. The bear isalways attacked with the rifle, often with the help of dogs to bringhim to bay. The umiaks when walrus hunting sometimes meet with bearsamong the loose ice. If the bear is caught in the water, there is verylittle difficulty in paddling up close enough to him to shoot him._The wolf._--The wolf can hardly be considered a regular object ofpursuit. Wolves are often seen and occasionally shot by deer huntersin the winter, and one family in the summer of 1883 managed to catch acouple of young wolf cubs alive, somewhere between Point Barrow andthe Colville. These they brought home with them and kept them picketedon the tundra just outside of the village, with a little kennel ofsnow to shelter them, carefully feeding them till winter, when theirfur had grown long enough for use in trimming hoods. They were thenkilled with a stone-headed arrow, which we were told was necessary forthe purpose, and their skins dressed and cut into strips which weresold around the village. Superstition required that the man who killedthese wolves should sleep outside of the house in a tent or snow hutfor “one moon” after killing them. We did not learn the reason forthis practice beyond that it would be “bad” to do otherwise._The fox._--Foxes are sometimes shot, but are generally taken in thetraps described above, which are usually set some distance from thevillage so as to avoid catching prowling dogs. Though generallyexceedingly shy, the fox is sometimes rendered careless by hunger. Oneof the women at the deer-hunters’ camp in the spring of 1882 caughtone in the little snow house built to store the meat and killed himwith a stick._The reindeer._--Reindeer are comparatively scarce within the radiusof a day’s march from Point Barrow, though solitary animals and smallparties are to be seen almost any day in the winter a few miles inlandfrom the seacoast. In the autumn, which is the rutting season, theyoccasionally wander down to the lagoons back of the beach. Nearlyevery day in the autumn and winter, when the weather is not stormy,one or more natives are out looking for reindeer, usually traveling onsnowshoes and carrying their rifles slung on their backs. The deer aregenerally very wild and often perceive a man and begin to run at adistance of a mile or two, though a rutting buck will sometimes fancythat a skin-clad Eskimo is a rival buck, and come toward him,especially if the hunter crouches down and keeps perfectly still.The usual method of hunting is to walk off inland until a deer issighted, when the hunter moves directly toward him at a rapid pace,without regard to the wind or attempting to conceal himself, whichwould be almost hopeless in such open country. As soon as the deerstarts to run, the hunter quickens his pace--to a run, if he has“wind” enough--and follows the game as long as he can keep it insight, trusting that the well known curiosity of the deer will induceit to “circle” round, in order to see what it is that is following himwith such pertinacity. Should the deer turn, as often happens,especially if there is more than one of them, the hunter alters hiscourse so as to head him off, and as soon as he gets within long riflerange opens fire, and keeps it up till the animal is hit or escapesout of range. Strange as it may seem, a number of deer are killedevery winter in this way.If a deer be killed, the hunter usually “butchers” him on the spot,and brings in as much of the meat as he can carry on his back, leavingthe rest, carefully covered with slabs of snow to protect it from thefoxes, to be brought in as soon as convenient by a dog sled, whichfollows the hunter’s tracks to the place.During the spring the deer retire some distance from the Point, andthe does then drop their fawns. At this season nearly all the nativesare busily engaged in the whale fishery, and pay little attention tothe reindeer, so that we did not learn where they went to. When thefawns are perhaps a month old a small party, say a young man and hiswife, sometimes makes a short journey to the eastward to procure fawnskins for clothing. They say that the fawns at this age can be caughtby running them down. During the summer again the deer come down tothe coast in small numbers, taking to the water in the lagoons, oreven in the sea, when the flies become troublesome.Sometimes in warm, calm weather the flies are so numerous that thedeer is driven perfectly frantic, and runs along without looking wherehe is going, so that, as the natives say, a hunter who places himselfin the deer’s path has no difficulty in shooting him. Flies wereunusually scarce both summers that we were at the station, so that wenever had an opportunity of seeing this done. When a deer is seenswimming he is pursued with the kaiak and lanced in the manner alreadydescribed. In July, 1883, one man from Utkiavwĭñ made a short journeyinland, “carrying” his kaiak from lake to lake, and killed two deer inthis way without firing a shot. I believe this method of hunting isfrequently practiced by the parties who go east for trading in thesummer, and those who visit the rivers for the purpose of hunting.The natives seemed to expect deer in summer at the lagoons, as alongthe isthmus between Imê´kpûñ and Imêkpûnĭglu they had set up a rangeof stakes, evidently intended to turn the deer up the beach where hewould be seen from the camp at Pernijû. Only one deer, however, camedown either summer, and he escaped without being seen. Thiscontrivance of setting up stakes to guide the deer in a certaindirection is very commonly used by the Eskimo. Egede gives a curiousdescription of the practice in Greenland in his day: They “chase them[i.e., the reindeer] by Clap-hunting, setting upon them on all sidesand surrounding them with all their Women and Children to force theminto Defiles and Narrow Passages, where the Men armed lay in wait forthem and kill them. And when they have not People enough to surroundthem, then they put up white Poles (to make up the Number that iswanted) with Pieces of Turf to head them, which frightens the Deer andhinders it from escaping.”[N364] Pl. 4, of the same work, is a verycurious illustration of this style of hunting.    [Footnote N364: Greenland, p. 62.]A similar method is practiced at the Coppermine River, where the deerare led by ranges of turf toward the spot where the archer ishidden.[N365] Franklin also noticed between the Mackenzie and theColville similar ranges of driftwood stumps leading across the plainto two cairns on a hill,[N366] and Thomas Simpson mentions a similarrange near Herschel Island,[N367] and double rows of turf to representmen leading down to a small lake near Point Pitt, for the purpose ofdriving the deer into the water where they could be speared.[N368]This is similar to the practice described by Schwatka[N369] among the“Netschilluk” of King William’s Land, where a line of cairns as highas a man and 50 to 100 yards apart is built along a ridge runningobliquely to the water. When deer are seen feeding near the water themen form a skirmish line from the last cairn to the water and advanceslowly. The deer mistake the cairns for men and take to the water,where they are easily speared.    [Footnote N365: Franklin, 1st Exped., vol. 2, p. 181.]    [Footnote N366: 2d Exped., p. 137.]    [Footnote N367: Narrative, p. 114.]    [Footnote N368: Ibid., p. 138.]    [Footnote N369: Science, vol. 4, 9, pp. 543-544.]The most important deer hunt takes place in the late fall and earlyspring, when the natives go inland 50 or 75 miles to the upper watersof Kuaru and Kulugrua, where the deer are exceedingly plentiful atthis season. Capt. Herendeen, who went inland with the deer hunters inthe autumn of 1882, reports that the bottom lands of Kulugrua “lookedlike a cattle yard,” from the tracks of the reindeer. They start assoon as it is possible to travel across the country with sledges,usually about the first of October, taking guns, ammunition, fishingtackle, and the necessary household utensils for themselves and theirfamilies, and stay till the daylight gets too short for hunting. In1882, many parties got home about October 27 or 28. At this seasonthere is seldom snow enough to build snow huts, so they generally livein tents, always close to the rivers from which they procure water forhousehold use. The men spend their time hunting the deer, while thewomen bring in the game, attend to drying the skins and the householdwork, and catch whitefish and burbot through the ice of the rivers,which are now frozen hard enough for this purpose. Some of the old menand those who have not a supply of ammunition engage in the samepursuit.A comparatively small number of the people go out to this fall deerhunt, which appears to be a new custom, adopted since Dr. Simpson’stime. It was probably not worth while to go out after deer at seasonswhen there was not enough snow for digging pitfalls, since theydepended chiefly on these for the capture of the reindeer before theintroduction of firearms. Fully half of each village go out on thespring deer hunt, as they did in Maguire’s time, the first partiesstarting out with the return of the sun, about January 23, and theothers following in the course of two or three weeks, and remain outtill about the middle of April, when it is time to come back for thewhale fishery. The people of Utkiavwĭñ always travel to the huntinggrounds by a regular road, which is the same as that followed byLieut. Ray in his exploring trips. They travel along the coast on theice wherever it is smooth enough till they reach Sĭ´ñaru, and thenstrike across country, crossing Kuaru and reaching Kulugrua near thehill Nuasu´knan. (See map, Pl. II.)The people from Nuwŭk travel straight across Elson Bay to the southtill they reach nearly the same region. Some parties from Nuwŭk alsohunt in the rough country between Kulugrua and Ikpĭkpûñ. As thesledges are heavily laden with camp equipage, provisions and oil forthe lamps, they travel slowly, taking four or five days for thejourney, stopping for the night with tolerable regularity at certainstations where the first party that travels over the trail build snowhuts, which are used by those who follow them. At the rivers they arescattered in small camps of four or five families, about a day’sjourney apart. As well as we could learn these camps are in regularlyestablished places, where the same people return every year, if theyhunt at all. It even seemed as if these localities were considered theproperty of certain influential families, who could allow any othersthey pleased to join their parties.[N370] It is certain, at allevents, that the people of Utkiavwĭñ did not hunt on the Ikpĭkpûñ withthe men of Nuwŭk. At this season they live entirely in snow huts,often excavated in the deep drifts under the river bluffs, and the menhunt deer while the women, as before, catch fish in Kuaru andKulugrua. None are taken in Ikpĭkpûñ. (See above, p. 58.)    [Footnote N370: Dr. Richardson believes that the hunting grounds    of families are kept sacred among the Eskimo. Searching    Expedition, vol. 1, pp. 244, 351. See also, the same author’s    paper, New Philosophical Journal, vol. 52, p. 323.]Deer are generally very plentiful at this season, though sometimes, ashappened in February, 1883, there comes a warm southerly wind whichmakes them all retreat farther inland for a few days. They aregenerally hunted by chasing them on snowshoes, in the manner alreadydescribed, but with much better chances of success, since when anumber of hunters are out in the same region the deer are kept moving,so that a herd started by one hunter is very apt to run within gunshotof another. The natives have generally very good success in thisspring hunt. Two men who were hunting on shares for the station killedupward of ninety reindeer in the season of 1883. A great deal of themeat is, of course, consumed on the spot, but a good many deer arebrought home frozen. They are skinned and brought home whole, only theheads and legs being cut off. The latter are disjointed at the kneeand elbow. These frozen carcasses are usually cut up with a saw forcooking. At this season the does are pregnant, and many good-sizedfetuses are brought home frozen. We were told that these wereexcellent food, though we never saw them eaten. For the first two orthree days after the return of the deer hunters to the village all thelittle boys are playing with these fetuses, which they set up astargets for their blunt arrows.Before starting for the deer hunt the hunters generally take themovable property which they do not mean to carry with them out of thehouse and bury it in the snow for safe keeping, apparently thinkingthat while a dishonest person might help himself to small articlesleft around the house, he could hardly go to work and dig up a cachewithout attracting the attention of the neighbors. If both familiesfrom a house go deer hunting, they either close it up entirely or elseget some family who have no house of their own to take care of itduring their absence. During the season, small parties, travelinglight, with very little baggage, make flying trips to the village,usually to get a fresh supply of ammunition or oil, and at the end ofthe season a lucky hunter almost always sends in to borrow extra dogsand hire women and children to help bring in his game. The skins,which at this season are very thick and heavy, suitable only forblankets, heavy stockings, etc., are simply rough dried in the openair, and brought in stacked up on a flat sled. Lieut. Ray met a Nuwŭkparty returning in 1882 with a pile of these skins that looked like aload of hay. With such heavy loads they, of course, travel veryslowly. A few natives, especially when short of ammunition, still useat this season the snow pitfalls mentioned by Capt. Maguire.[N371]    [Footnote N371: Northwest Passage, Appendix, p. 387.]The following is the description of those seen by Lieut. Ray in 1883:A round hole is dug in the drifted snow, along the bank of a stream orlake. This is about 5 feet in diameter and 5 or 6 feet deep, and isbrought up to within 2 or 3 inches of the surface, where there is onlya small hole, through which the snow was removed. This is carefullyclosed with a thin slab of snow and baited by strewing reindeer mossand bunches of grass over the thin surface, through which the deerbreaks as soon as he steps on it. The natives say that they sometimesget two deer at once.This method of hunting the reindeer appears uncommon among the Eskimo.I find no mention of it except at Repulse Bay,[N372] and among theNetsillingmiut, where dogs’ urine is said to be sprinkled on the snowas a bait to attract the deer by its “Salzgehalt.”[N373] Lieut. Raywas informed by the natives that the “Nunatañmiun” also captured deerby means of a rawhide noose set across a regular deer path, when theydiscovered such. The noose is held up and spread by a couple ofsticks, and the end staked to the ground with a piece of antler.A similar method was practiced by the natives of Norton Sound.[N374]A few parties visit the rivers in summer for the purpose of huntingreindeer, but most of the natives are either off on the tradingexpeditions previously mentioned or else settled in the small campsalong the coast, 3 or 4 miles apart, whence they occasionally go ashort distance inland in search of reindeer.    [Footnote N372: Rae, Narratives, etc., p. 135.]    [Footnote N373: Klutschak, “Als Eskimo,” etc., p. 131.]    [Footnote N374: Dall, Alaska, p. 147.]_The seal._--The flesh of the smaller seals forms such a staple offood, and their blubber and skin serve so many important purposes,that their capture is one of the most necessary pursuits at PointBarrow, and is carried on at all seasons of the year and in manydifferent methods. During the season of open water many seals are shotfrom the umiaks engaged in whaling and walrus hunting or caught innets set along the shore at Elson Bay. This is also the only seasonwhen seals can be captured with the small kaiak darts.The principal seal fishery, however, begins with the closing of thesea, usually about the middle of October. When the pack ice comes inthere are usually many small open pools, to which the seals resort forair. Most of the able-bodied men in the village are out every dayarmed with the rifle and retrieving harpoon, traveling many milesamong the ice hummocks in search of such holes. When a seal shows hishead he is shot at with the rifle, and the hunter, if successful,secures his game with the harpoon. This method of hunting is practicedthroughout the winter wherever open holes form in the ice. A nativegoing to visit his nets or to examine the condition of the ice alwayscarries his rifle and retrieving harpoon, in case he should comeacross an open hole where seals might be found. The hunt at thisseason is accompanied with considerable danger, as the ice pack is notyet firmly consolidated and portions of it frequently move offshorewith a shift of the wind, so that the hunter runs the risk of beingcarried out to sea. The natives exercise considerable care, andgenerally avoid crossing a crack if the wind, however light, isblowing offshore; but in spite of their precautions men are every nowand then carried off to sea and never return.The hunters meet with many exciting adventures. On the morning ofNovember 24, 1882, all the heavy ice outside of the bar broke awayfrom the shore, leaving a wide lead, and began to move rapidly to thenortheast, carrying with it three seal hunters. They were fortunatelynear enough to the village to be seen by the loungers on the villagehill, who gave the alarm. An umiak was immediately mounted on a flatsled and carried out over the shore ice with great rapidity, so thatthe men were easily rescued. The promptness and energy with which thepeople at the village acted showed how well the danger wasappreciated.At this season of the year a single calm night is sufficient to coverall the holes and leads with young ice strong enough to support a man,and occasionally before the pack comes in the open sea freezes over.In this young ice the seals make their breathing holes (adlu), “aboutthe Bigness of a Halfpenny,” as Egede says, and the natives employ thestabbing harpoon for their capture. At the present day this is seldomused alone, but the seal is shot through the head as he comes to thesurface, and the spear only used to secure him. Seals which have beenshot in this way are sometimes carried off by the current before theycan be harpooned. As far as I can learn, this practice of shootingseals at the adlu is peculiar to Point Barrow (including probably therest of the Arctic coast as far as Kotzebue Sound), though the use ofthe _una_, as already stated, is very general.This method of hunting can generally be prosecuted only a few days ata time, as the movements of the pack soon break up the fields of youngice, though new fields frequently form in the course of the season.After the January gales the pack is so firmly consolidated that thereare no longer any open holes or leads, and when the spring leads openyoung ice seldom forms, so that this method of hunting is as a ruleconfined to the period between the middle of October and the earlypart of January.With the departure of the sun, about the middle of November, beginsthe netting, which is the most important fishery of the year, butwhich can be prosecuted with success only in the darkest nights. Thenatives say that even a bright aurora interferes with the netting. Atthis season narrow leads of open water are often formed parallel tothe shore, and frequently remain open for several days. The nativesare constantly reconnoitering the ice in search of such leads, andwhen one is found nearly all the men in the village go out to it withtheir nets. A place is sought where the ice is tolerably level and nottoo thick for about a hundred yards back from the lead, at whichdistance the nets are set, often a number of them close together, inthe manner already described, so that they hang like curtains underthe ice, parallel to the edge of the open water. When darkness comeson the hunters begin to rattle on the ice with their ice picks,scratch with the seal call, or make some other gentle and continuousnoise, which soon excites the curiosity of the seals that are swimmingabout in the open lead. One at length dives under the ice and swims inthe direction of the sound, which of course leads him directly intothe net, where he is entangled.On favorable nights a great many seals are captured in this way. Forinstance, on the night of December 2, 1882, the netters from Utkiavwĭñalone took at least one hundred seals. Such lucky hauls are notcommon, however. As the weather at this season is often excessivelycold, the seals freeze stiff soon after they are taken from the net,and if sufficient snow has fallen they are stacked up by stickingtheir hind flippers in the snow. This keeps them from being covered upand lost if the snow begins to drift. I have counted thirty seals, theproperty of one native, piled up in this way into a single stack. Thewomen and children go out at their convenience with dog sleds andbring in the seals. A woman, however, who is at work on deerskinclothing must not touch a hand to the seals or the sled on which theyare loaded, but may lend a hand at hauling on the drag line. When theseals are brought to the edge of the beach they must not be taken onland till each has been given a mouthful of fresh water. We did notlearn the object of this practice, but Nordenskiöld, who observed asimilar custom at Pitlekaj, was informed that it was to keep the leadsfrom closing.[N375]    [Footnote N375: Vega, vol. 2, p. 130. Compare the custom observed    in Baffin Land, of sprinkling a few drops of water on the head of    the seal before it is cut up, mentioned by Hall, Arctic    Researches, p. 573.]When the lead keeps open for several days, or there is a prospect ofits opening again, the hunter leaves his gear out on the ice,sometimes bringing his ice pick, scoop, and setting pole part way homeand sticking them up in the snow alongside of the path. In 1884 a leadremained open for several days about 3 or 4 miles from the village,and the natives made a regular beaten trail out to it. When we visitedthe netting ground the lead had closed, but nearly all the men hadleft their gear sticking up near it, with the nets tied up and hungupon the ice picks. They had built little walls of snow slabs as aprotection against the wind. The season for this netting ends with theJanuary gales, which close the leads permanently.Later in the winter the seals resort to very inconsiderable cracksamong the hummocks for air, and nets are set hanging around thesecracks, so that a seal can not approach the crack without beingcaught. There was such a crack just in the edge of the rough landfloe, not half a mile from Utkiavwĭñ, in February, 1883, from whichtwo men took several seals, visiting the nets every day or two. Thosemen who do not go off on the deer hunt keep one or more seal nets setall winter, either in this way or in the third method, which can bepracticed only after the daylight has come back, when the ice isthick. At this season there are frequently to be found among thehummocks what the natives call _i´glus_, dome-shaped snow houses about6 feet in diameter and 2 or 3 feet high, with a smooth round hole inthe top, and communicating with the water. These are undoubtedly thesame as the snow burrows described by Kumlien,[N376] which the femaleseal builds to bring forth her young in.[N377] They are curiousconstructions, looking astonishingly like a man’s work. The nativestold me that nets set at these places were for the capture of youngseals (nĕtyiáru). It appears that these houses are the property of asingle female only until her young one is able to take to the water,as a net is kept set at one of these holes, as well as I couldunderstand, sometimes capturing several seals. The net is set flatunder the hole, the corners being drawn out by cords let down throughsmall holes in a circle round the main opening, through which the netis drawn. A seal rising to the surface runs his head through themeshes of the net. The small holes and sometimes the middle one arecarefully covered with slabs of snow.    [Footnote N376: Contributions, p. 57.]    [Footnote N377: Hall, Arctic Researches, pp. 507 and 578, with    diagrams.]The officers of the revenue steamer _Corwin_, who made the sledgejourney along the northeast coast of Siberia in the early summer of1881, saw seal nets set in this way, flat, under air holes in the ice,with a hole for each corner of the net. When a seal was caught the netwas drawn up through the middle hole with a hooked pole.[N378] In 1883they began setting these nets at Point Barrow about March 4, andprobably about the same date the year before, though we did not happento observe this method of netting until considerably later.    [Footnote N378: Hooper, Corwin Report, p. 25.]In June and July, when the ice becomes rotten and worn into holes, theseals “haul out” to bask in the sun, and are then stalked and shot.They are exceedingly wary at this season. The seal usually taken inthe methods above described is the rough or ringed seal (Phocafœtida), but in 1881 a single male ribbon seal (Histriophoca fasciata)was netted, and in 1882 a native shot one at the breathing hole, butit was carried away by the current before he could secure it. Thenatives said that they sometimes caught the harbor seal (P. vitulina)in the shore nets in Elson Bay. The bearded seal (Erignathusbarbatus), whose skin is especially prized for making harpoon lines,boot soles, umiak covers, etc., is never very abundant, and occurschiefly in the season of open water, when it is captured from theumiak with harpoon and rifle, but they are sometimes found in thewinter, as two were killed at breathing holes in the rough ice January8, 1883._The walrus._--The walrus occurs only during the season of open water,and is almost always captured from the umiak with the large harpoonand rifle. The whaling boats usually find a few, especially late inthe season, and after the trading parties have gone in the summer thenatives who remain are generally out in the boats a good deal of thetime looking for walrus and seals. As a general thing walrus areespecially plenty in September, when much loose ice is movingbackwards and forwards with the current, frequently sleeping in largeherds upon cakes of ice. The boats, which are out nearly every day atthis season with volunteer crews, not regularly organized as forwhaling, paddle as near as they can to these sleeping herds and try toshoot them in the head, aiming also to “fasten” to as many as they canwith the harpoon and float as they hurry into the water. A harpoonedwalrus is followed up with the boat and shot with the rifle when achance is offered. Swimming walruses are chased with the boat and“fastened to” by darting the harpoon. When a walrus is killed it istowed up to the nearest cake of ice and cut up on the spot. We neverknew of the kaiak being used in walrus-hunting, as is the custom amongthe eastern Eskimo._The whale._--The pursuit of the “bowhead” whale (Balæna mysticetus),so valuable not only for the food furnished by its flesh and“blackskin” and the oil from its blubber, but for the whalebone, whichserves so many useful purposes in the arts of the Eskimo and isbesides the chief article of trade with the ships, is carried on withgreat regularity and formality. In the first place all the umialĭks(boat-owners) or those who are to be the captains of whaling umiaks,before the deer hunters start out in January, bring all the gear to beused in the whale fishery to the kû´dyĭgĭ, where it is consecrated bya ceremony consisting of drumming and singing, perhaps partaking ofthe nature of an incantation.Capt. Herendeen was the only one of our party who witnessed thisceremony, which took place at Utkiavwĭñ on January 9, 1883, and he didnot bring back a detailed account of the proceedings. During part ofthe ceremony all the umialĭks were seated in a row upon the floor, anda woman passed down the line marking each across the face with anoblique streak of blacklead. As soon as the deer hunters return in thespring they begin getting ready for the whales, covering the boats,fitting lines to harpoons, and putting gear of all sorts in perfectorder. Every article to be used in whaling--harpoons, lances, paddles,and even the timbers of the boats--must be scraped perfectlyclean.[N379] This work is generally done by the umialĭk himself andhis family, as the crews do not enter on their duties till the whalingactually commences. The crews are regularly organized for the season,and are made up during the winter and early spring. They consist ofeight or ten persons to each boat, including the captain, who isalways the owner of the boat, and sits in the stern and steers, usinga larger paddle than the rest, and the harpooner, who occupies thebow. When a bombgun is carried it is intrusted to a third man, whosits in the waist of the boat, and whose duty it is to shoot the whalewhenever he sees a favorable opportunity, whether it has beenharpooned or not. The rest are simply paddlers.    [Footnote N379: Compare Egede, Greenland, p. 102. The whale “can’t    bear sloven and dirty habits.”]When used for whaling, the umiak is propelled by paddles alone, sailsand oars never being even taken on board. Men are preferred for thewhaling crews when enough can be secured, otherwise the vacancies arefilled by women, who make efficient paddlers. Some umialĭks hire theircrews, paying them a stipulated price in tobacco and other articles,and providing them with food during the season. Others ship men onshares. We did not learn the exact proportions of these shares in anycase. They appear to concern the whalebone alone, as all seem to beentitled to as much of the flesh and blubber as they can cut off inthe general scramble. At this season exploring parties are out everyday examining the state of the ice to ascertain when the pack islikely to break away from the landfloe, and also to find the best pathfor the umiaks through the hummocks.In 1882 the condition of the ice was such that the boats could betaken out directly from Utkiavwĭñ, by a somewhat winding path, to theedge of the land floe about five or six miles from the shore. Thispath was marked out by the seal-hunters during the winter, and some ofthe natives spent their leisure time widening and improving it,knocking off projecting points of ice with picks and whale spades, andfilling up the worst of the inequalities. Much of the path, however,was exceedingly rough and difficult when it was considered finished.In 1883 the land floe was so rough and wide abreast of the villagethat no practicable path could be made, so all the whalemen with theirfamilies moved up to Imê´kpûñ and encamped in tents as alreadydescribed (see p. 84) for the season. From this point a tolerablystraight and easy path was made out to the edge of the land floe. Thenatives informed me as early as April 1 that it would be necessary forthem to move up to Imê´kpûñ, adding that the ice abreast of thevillage was very heavy and would move only when warm weather came.This prediction was correct, as the season of 1883 was so late that noships reached the station until August 1.About the middle of April the natives begin anxiously to expect aneast or southeast wind (nígyǝ) to drive off the pack and open theleads, and should it not speedily blow from that quarter recourse ishad to supernatural means to bring it. A party of men go out and sitin a semicircle facing the sea on the village cliff, while one man inthe middle beats a drum and sings a monotonous chant, interrupted bycurious vibrating cries, accompanied with a violent shaking of thehead from side to side. This ceremony is conducted with greatsolemnity, and the natives seemed disinclined to have us witness it,so that we learned very little about it. They, however, told us thatthe chant was addressed to a tuaña or spirit, requesting him to makethe desired wind blow.[N380] It does not appear to be necessary thatthe man who delivers the invocation should be a regular magician or“doctor.” A succession of unsuccessful attempts were made in 1882,some of them by men who never to our knowledge practiced incantationson other occasions. During this period, and while the whaling is goingon, no pounding must be done in the village, and it is not allowableeven to rap with the knuckles on wood for fear of frightening away thewhales.[N381] It is interesting to find that at Norton Sound, wherethe whale is not pursued, this superstition has been transferred tothe salmon fishery, one of the most important industries of the year.Mr. Dall[N382] says: “While the fishery lasts no wood must be cut withan axe, or the salmon will disappear.”    [Footnote N380: Hall speaks of seeing the angeko “very busy    ankooting on the hills”--“To try and get the pack ice out of the    bay.”--Arctic Res., p. 573.]    [Footnote N381: Compare Rink, Tales, etc., p. 55: “To the customs    just enumerated may be added various regulations regarding the    chase, especially that of the whale, this animal being easily    scared away by various kinds of impurity or disorder.”]    [Footnote N382: Alaska, p. 147.]As soon as the lead opens, and sometimes before when the prospectlooks promising, the boats are taken out to the edge of the land floeand kept out there during the season, which lasts till about the lastweek in June, when they are brought in and got ready for the summerexpeditions. When the lead closes, as often happens, the boats arehauled up on the ice and many or all of the crews come home untilthere are prospects of open water. When there is open water, the boatsare always on the lookout for whales, either cruising about in thelead or lying up at the edge of the floe, the crews eating andsleeping when they can get a chance and shooting seals and ducks whenthere are no whales in sight. The women and children travel back andforth between the village and the boats, carrying supplies of food forthe whalemen.In 1883, there was a regular beaten trail along the smooth shore icebetween Imê´kpûñ and Utkiavwĭñ, where people were constantly travelingback and forth. When the boats are out no woman is allowed to sew, aswas noticed by Dr. Simpson.[N383] To carry the umiak out over the iceit is lashed on a flat sled and drawn by dogs and men. A descriptionof one of these boats which I accompanied for part of its journey outto the open water, will show how a whaleboat is fitted out. Therifles, harpoons, lances, and other gear of the party were sent onahead on a sled drawn by half a dozen dogs, with a woman to lead them.After these had made a short stage, they were unfastened from thissled and brought back and harnessed to the flat sled on which theumiak was lashed. The party, which consisted of five men and twowomen, one of whom remained with the sled load of gear, then startedahead, the women running in front of the dogs and the men pushing atthe sides of the boat. The boat travels very easily and rapidly onsmooth ice, but among the hummocks the men have hard work pushing andscrambling, and occasional stops have to be made to widen narrowplaces in the path and to chisel off projecting points of ice whichmight pierce the skin cover of the boat. When they came up to thefirst sled the women were again sent on with this while the menrested. The inflated sealskin floats, five or six in number, the whaleharpoon, and whale spades, and ice picks were carried in the boats.    [Footnote N383: Loc. cit., p. 261.]A whaling umiak always carries a number of amulets to insure success.These consisted in this case of two wolf skulls, a dried raven, theaxis vertebra of a seal, and numerous feathers. The skin of a goldeneagle is considered an excellent charm for whaling, and Nĭkawaalu wasparticularly desirous to secure the tip of a red fox’s tail, which hesaid was a powerful amulet. The captain and harpooner wore fillets ofmountain sheepskin, with a little crystal or stone image of a whaledangling at each side of the face, and the captain’s fillet was alsofringed with the incisor teeth of the mountain sheep. Both wore littlestone whales attached to the breast of the jacket, and one woman andone or two of the men had streaks of black lead on their faces.[N384]    [Footnote N384: Compare Egede, Greenland, p. 102. “When they go a    Whale-catching they put on their best Gear or Apparel, as if they    were going to a Wedding Feast, fancying that if they did not come    cleanly and neatly dressed the Whale, who can’t bear sloven and    dirty Habits, would shun them and fly from them.”    See also Crantz, History of Greenland, Vol. I, p. 121. “They dress    themselves in the best manner for it, because, according to the    portentous sayings of their sorcerers, if any one was to wear    dirty cloaths, especially such in which he had touched a dead    corpse, the whale would escape, or, even if it was already dead,    would at least sink.”]When they are on the watch for whales the great harpoon is kept alwaysrigged and resting in a crotch of ivory in the bow of the boat. When awhale is sighted they paddle up as close as possible and the harpoonerthrusts the harpoon into him. The whale dives, with the floatsattached to him, and the shaft, which is retained, is rigged forstriking him when he rises again. The other boats, if any are near,join in the chase until the whale is so wearied that he can be lancedor a favorable opportunity occurs for shooting him. All boats in sightat the time the whale is struck, as I understood, are entitled to anequal share of the whalebone.As soon as the whale is killed he is towed up to the edge of the landfloe and everybody standing on the edge of the ice and in the boatsbegins hacking away, at random, at the flesh and blubber, some of themgoing to work more carefully to cut out the whalebone. The “cuttingin” is managed without order or control, everybody who can be on thespot being apparently entitled to all the meat, blubber, and blackskinhe or she can cut off. The same custom was practiced in Greenland, andis to this day in eastern Siberia.While they are very particular in all superstitious observancesregarding the whales, they are less careful about certain things, suchas loud talking and firing guns at seals and fowl when they arewaiting for whales, which really hurt their chances with the timidanimals. They are less energetic than one would suppose in pursuit ofthe whale, according to Capt. Herendeen, who spent several days eachseason with the whaleboats. Instead of cruising about the lead insearch of whales they are rather inclined to lie in wait for them atthe edge of the floe, so that when the open water is wide many whalesescape.When the leads are very narrow the whales are sometimes shot with thebombgun from the edge of the ice. Success in this appears to bevariable. In 1882 only one small whale was secured, and in 1883 onefull-grown one, though several were struck and lost each season. Theveteran whaling-master, Capt. L. C. Owen, informs me that one seasonthe boats of these two villages captured ten. The season of 1885 wasvery successful. The natives of the two villages are reported to havetaken twenty-eight whales. Capt. E. E. Smith, however, informs me thatonly seven of these were full-grown.When actually engaged in whaling the umialik exercises a very fairdegree of discipline, but at other times he seems hardly able to keephis men from straggling off to go home or to visit their seal nets,etc., so that he sometimes has to chase a whale “short-handed.”Nowhere else among the Eskimo does the whale fishery appear to beconducted in such regular manner with formally organized crews as uponthis northwest coast. From all accounts the animal is only casuallypursued elsewhere with fleets of kaiaks or umiaks manned by volunteercrews.[N385]    [Footnote N385: See Egede, Greenland, p. 102; Crantz, History of    Greenland, Vol. I, p. 121; Parry, 2d. Voy., p. 509 (Iglulik);    McClure, Northwest Passage, p. 92 (Cape Bathurst).]The beluga or white whale is only casually pursued, and as far as Icould learn is always shot with the rifle. It is not abundant._Fowl._--During the winter months a few ptarmigan are occasionallyshot, but the natives pay no special attention to birds until thespring migrations. The first ducks appear a little later than thewhales, about the end of April or the first week of May, and from thattime till the middle of June scarcely a day passes when they are notmore or less plenty. The king ducks (Somateria spectabilis) are thefirst to appear, while the Pacific eiders (S. v-nigra) arrive somewhatlater, and are more abundant towards the end of the migrations. Atthis season all women and children, and many men, go armed with thebolas, and everybody is always on the lookout for flocks of ducks. Onfour or five favorable days each season, at intervals of a week or tendays, there are great flights of eiders coming up in huge flocks oftwo or three hundred, stretched out in long diagonal lines. Theseflocks follow one another in rapid succession and keep the line of thecoast, apparently striking straight across Peard Bay from the SeahorseIslands to a point four or five miles below Utkiavwĭñ, and most ofthem fly up along the smooth shore-ice to Pernyû or Point Barrow. Someflocks always fly up among the hummocks of the land floe, and a fewothers turn eastward below the village and continue their course tothe northeast across the land.On the days between the great flights there are always a few flockspassing, and some days when there is no flight along shore they arevery abundant out at the open water, where the whalemen shoot them inthe intervals of whaling. When a great flight begins the people at thevillage hasten out and form a sort of skirmish line across the shoreice from the shore to the hummocks, a few sometimes stationingthemselves among the latter. They take but little pains to concealthemselves, frequently sitting out on the open ice-field on sealingstools or squares of bearskins. The ducks generally keep on theircourse without paying much attention to the men, and in fact one mayoften get a shot by running so as to head off an approaching flock.Firing, however, frightens them and makes them rise to a considerableheight, often out of gunshot. Many ducks are taken with guns and bolasin these flights.Rather late in the season the old squaws (Clangula hyemalis) pass tothe northeast in large flocks, but usually go so high than none aretaken. A good many of these, however, with a few eiders, geese, brant,and loons, remain and breed on the tundra, and are occasionally shotby the natives, though most of them are too busy with whaling and sealand walrus hunting to pay much attention to birds. Small parties oftwo or three lads or young men, sometimes with their wives, make shortexcursions inland to the small streams and sand islands east of PointBarrow, after birds and eggs, and the boys from the small camps alongthe coast towards Woody Inlet are always on the lookout for eggs andsmall birds, such as they can kill with their bows and arrows or catchin snares. They say that the parties which go east, and those whichvisit the rivers in summer, get many eggs and find plenty of ducks,geese, and swans, which have molted their flight feathers so that theyare unable fly.About the end of July the return migration of the ducks begins. Atthis season the flocks, which are generally smaller and more compactthan in the spring, come from the east along the northern shore, andcross out to sea at the isthmus of Pernyû, where the natives assemblein large numbers to shoot them as well as to meet with theNunatañmiun. All the people who have been scattered along the coast insmall camps gradually collect at this season at Pernyû, and thereturning eastern parties generally stop there two or three days;while, after they have brought their families back to the village, themen frequently walk up to Pernyû for a day or two of duck shooting.The tents are pitched just in the bend of Elson Bay, and north of themis a narrow place in the sandspit over which the ducks often pass.Here the natives dig shallow pits in the gravel, in which they postthemselves with guns and bolas. A line of posts is set up along thebend of the beach from the tents almost to the outlet of Imêkpûniglu.When a light breeze is blowing from the northeast the ducks, no matterhow far off shore they are when first seen, always head for the pointof land on the other side of this outlet, probably with the intentionof following the line of lagoons and going out to sea farther down thecoast, as they sometimes do. When, however, they reach this criticalpoint they catch sight of the posts, and the natives who are watchingthem sharply set up a shrill yell. Frightened by this and by the lineof posts, nine times out of ten, if the cry is given at the rightmoment, the ducks will falter, become confused, and, finally,collecting into a compact body will whirl along the line of posts,past the tents, flying close to the water, and turn out to sea at thefirst open space, which is just where the gunners are posted. Thishabit of yelling to frighten the ducks and bring them within gunshothas been observed on the Siberian coast in places where the ducks arein the habit of flying in and out from lagoons over low bars.[N386]Should the wind blow hard from the east, however, or blow from anyother quarter, the ducks do not fly in such abundance, nor do they paymuch attention to the posts or the yelling, but often keep on theircourse down the lagoons, or head straight for the beach and crosswherever they strike it. The latter is generally the habit with theold squaws, who come rather late in the migrations, while the blackbrant (Branta nigricans) are more apt to go down the lagoons. A fewpintail ducks (Dafila acuta), are occasionally shot at this season,and are sometimes found in the two little village ponds (Tûseraru).The shooting at Pernyû usually lasts till the middle or end ofSeptember, during which month the natives also shoot a good many gulls(Larus barrovianus and Rhodostethia rosea) as they fly along theshore.    [Footnote N386: Von der Lagune aus pflegten jeden Morgen und Abend    grosse Entenschaaren über den Ort hinweg nach dem Meere zu    fliegen. Dann wurden durch Pfeifen und Schreien die Thiere so    geängstigt, dass sie ihren Flug abwärts richteten und nun durch    die mit grosser Sicherheit geworfene Schleuder oder durch    Flintenschüsse erreicht werden konnten. (East Cape), Krause    Brothers, Geographische Blätter, Vol. 5, pt. 1, p. 32.    “The birds were easily called from their course of flight, as we    repeatedly observed. If a flock should be passing a hundred yards    or more to one side, the natives would utter a long, peculiar cry,    and the flock would turn instantly to one side and sweep by in a    circuit, thus affording the coveted opportunity for bringing down    some of their number.” (Cape Wankarem), Nelson, Cruise of the    Corwin, p. 100.]IMPLEMENTS FOR FISHING._Hooks and lines._--The streams and lakes in the immediateneighborhood of Point Barrow contain no fish, and there iscomparatively little fishing in the sea. When the water first closesin the autumn narrow tide cracks often form at the very edge of thebeach. At these cracks the natives frequently catch considerablenumbers of Polar cod (Boreogadus saida) and small sculpins (Cottusquadricornis and C. decastrensis), with the hook and line. The tacklefor this fishing consists of a short line of whalebone, provided witha little “squid” or artificial bait of ivory, and fastened to a woodenrod about 18 inches or 2 feet long. The lure, which is apparentlymeant to represent a small shrimp, is kept moving, and the fish biteat it. We brought home two complete sets of tackle for this kind offishing, two lines without rods and twelve lures or hooks. No. 89548[1733] Fig. 264, has been selected for description.The line is 40 inches long and made of four strips of whalebone 0.1inch wide, fastened together with what appear to be “waterknots.” Twoof these strips are of black whalebone, respectively 4½ and 9 incheslong; the other two are of light colored whalebone and 15½ and 11inches long. The light colored end is made fast to the eye in thesmall end of the hook as follows: The end is passed through the eye,doubled back and passed through a single knot in the standing part,and knotted round the latter with a similar knot (Fig. 265). This knotis the one generally used in fastening a fishing line to the hook. Theother end is doubled in a short bight into which is becket-hitched oneend of a bit of sinew thread about 3 inches long, and the other end isknotted into a notch at one end of the rod, as the whalebone would betoo stiff to tie securely to the stick. The rod is a roughly whittledsplinter of California redwood, 14½ inches long. The body of the lureis a piece of walrus ivory 1½ inches long. Through a hole in the largeend of this is driven the barbless brass hook, with a broad thin plateat one end bent up, flush with the convex side. When not in use theline is reeled lengthwise on the rod, secured by a notch at each endof the latter, and the hook stuck into the wood on one side of therod. The hook is wedged into the body of the lure with a bit ofwhalebone. The other specimen, No. 89547, [1733] from the samevillage, is almost exactly like this, but has a slightly shorter line,made of three strips of bone, of which the lower two, as before, areof light colored whalebone. The object of using this material isprobably to render the part of the line which is under water lessconspicuous, as we use leaders and casting lines of transparentsilkworm gut. The body of the lure is made of old brown walrus ivory.These lures are 1 inch to 1½ inches long, and vary little in the shapeof the body which is usually made of walrus ivory, in most casesdarkened on the surface by age or charring, so that when carved intoshape it is parti-colored, black and white. The body is oftenornamented with small colored beads inlaid for eyes and along the back(Fig. 266_a_, No. 56609 [153], from Utkiavwĭñ).  [Illustration: FIG. 264.--Tackle for shore fishing. 3/4]  [Illustration: FIG. 265.--Knot of line into hook.]The hook is usually of the shape described but is sometimes simply aslightly recurved spur about ½-inch long as in Fig. 266_b_ (No. 56610[160], also from Utkiavwĭñ). It is usually of brass or copper, rarelyof iron. Two peculiar lures from Utkiavwĭñ, are No. 56705 [150_a_ and150_b_]. The first, _a_, has a body of brass of the usual shape, and acopper hook, and the other, _b_, has the body made of a strip of thinbrass to the back of which is fastened a lump of lead or pewter. Thehook appears to be made of a common copper tack. We were informed thatthese lures were also used for catching small fish, trout, smelts, andperhaps grayling in the rivers in summer. No. 89554 [950], Fig.267_a_, from Utkiavwĭñ, is perhaps intended exclusively for thispurpose, as it is larger than the others, (1.9 inch long) and highlyornamented with beads. Fig. 267_b_, No. 89783 [1007], is one of thesebeaded lures (2½ inches long), with an iron hook, undoubtedly forriver fishing, as it belonged to the “inland” native, Ilû´bw’ga. Itdiffers slightly in shape from the others, having two eyes at thesmall end into which is fastened a leader of sinew braid 3 incheslong. On this are strung four blue glass beads and one red one.  [Illustration: FIG. 266.--Small fishhooks. 3/4]  [Illustration: FIG. 267.--Hooks for river fishing. 1/2]No. ----[N387] [151] Fig. 268, from Utkiavwĭñ, is a rod rigged forfishing in the rivers. The rod is a roughly whittled stick of spruceor pine, 27 inches long. One line is 43 and the other 36 inches longand each is made of two strips of whalebone of which the lower islight colored as usual. The shorter line carries a small plain ivorylure of the common pattern, and the longer one a little flat barblesshook of copper with a broad flat shank. This was probably scrapedbright and used without bait. The lines are reeled in the usual manneron the rod, and the hooks caught into notches on the sides of it. Thesmall lures are called nĭ´ksĭñ.  [Illustration: FIG. 268.--Tackle for river fishing. 1/8]    [Footnote N387: Museum number effaced.]When at the rivers in the autumn and early spring, they fish forburbot with a line carrying a peculiar large hook called iɐkqlûñ,which is baited with a piece of whitefish. There are two forms of thishook, which is from 3 to 5¼ inches long. One form differs in size onlyfrom the small nĭ´ksĭn, but is always of white ivory and not beaded(Fig. 269, No. 89550 [780] from Utkiavwĭñ, which is 4½ inches long andhas a copper hook). The hook is of copper, brass or iron. The otherform, which is perhaps the commoner, has a narrow flat body, slightlybent, and serrated on the edges to give a firm attachment to the bait.This body is usually of antler, and has a copper or iron hook eitherspur-shaped or of the common form as in Fig. 270, No. 89553 [764] fromUtkiavwĭñ, which has a body of walrus ivory 4 inches long and a copperhook. Of late years, small cod hooks obtained from the ships have beenadapted to these bodies, as is seen in Fig. 271, No. 89552 [841] fromUtkiavwĭñ. The shank of the hook has been half imbedded in alongitudinal groove on the flatter side of the body, with the bend ofthe hook projecting about ¼ inch beyond the tip of the latter. Thering of the hook has been bent open and the end sunk into the body.The hook is held on by two lashings of sinew, one at each end of theshank.  [Illustration: FIG. 269.--Burbot hook, 1st pattern. 1/3]  [Illustration: FIG. 270.--Burbot hook, 2d pattern. 1/3]  [Illustration: FIG. 271.--Burbot hook, made of cod hook. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 272.--Burbot tackle, baited. 1/6]No. 56594 [32] from Utkiavwĭñ is like the preceding, but has a largerhook, which from the bend to the point is wrapped in a piece of deerskin with the flesh side out, and wound with sinew having a tuft ofhair at the point of the hook. This is probably to hide the point whenthe hook is baited. No. 56594 [167] from Utkiavwĭñ, has the hookfastened to the back of the body instead of the flat side. The mannerin which these hooks are baited is shown in Fig. 272, which representsa complete set of burbot tackle (No. 89546 [946]) brought in and soldby some Utkiavwĭñ natives, just as they had been using it in theautumn of 1882 at Kuaru or Kulugrua. A piece of whitefish, flesh andskin, with the scales removed is wrapped round the hook so as to makea club-shaped body 4½ inches long and is sewed up along one side withcotton twine. The copper spur projects through the skin on the otherside. This hook would not hold the fish unless it were “gorged,” butthe voracious burbot always swallows its prey. In dressing these fishfor the table, whitefish of considerable size were frequently found inthem. The line is of whalebone like those already described but alittle stouter, 78 inches long, and made of seven pieces, all black.The end of the line is fastened into an eye in the small end of arough club-shaped sinker of walrus ivory, 4¾ inches long. There isanother eye at the large end of the sinker, for the attachment of aleader of double sinew braid 5½ inches long connecting the hook withthe sinker.The reel, which serves also as a short rod, is of yellow pine 19½inches long. When the line is reeled up, the hook is caught into thewood on one side of the reel. No. 89545 [946] is a similar set ofbaited tackle, bought from the same natives, differing from thepreceding only in proportions, having a longer line--9 feet and 6inches--and a somewhat larger bait. We also procured two sets ofburbot tackle unbaited.One of these (No. 56543 [33] from Utkiavwĭñ) has a whalebone line 14feet long, and a roughly octahedral sinker of walrus ivory 3 incheslong and 1½ in diameter. The hook, which is joined to the sinker asbefore by a leader of stout sinew braid, is of the second pattern,with serrated edges, and a copper hook. The leader is neatly splicedinto this. The other, No. 56544 [187], also from Utkiavwĭñ, has nosinker and a hook with a club-shaped body and iron spur. It wasprobably put together for sale, as it is new. The sinkers, of which wecollected five, besides those already mentioned, are always about thesame weight and either club-shaped or roughly octahedral. They arealways of walrus ivory and usually carelessly made. Fig. 273(No. 56577 [260]) represents one of these sinkers (kíbica), on whichthere is some attempt at ornamentation. On the larger are two eyes andthe outline of a mouth like a shark’s, incised and filled in withblack refuse oil.  [Illustration: FIG. 273.--Ivory sinker. 1/2]A similar line and reel are used for catching polar cod in the springand late winter through the ice at some distance from the shore. Theselines are 10 or 15 fathoms long, and provided with a heavy sinker ofivory, copper, or rarely lead, to which are attached by whaleboneleaders of unequal length, two little jiggers like Fig. 274 (theproperty of the writer, from Utkiavwĭñ). This is of white walrusivory, 2⅛ inches long and ⅜ in diameter at the largest part. The twoslender hooks are of copper and are secured by wedges of whalebone.This makes a contrivance resembling the squid jigs used by ourfishermen. These jiggers are sometimes made wholly of copper, which isscraped bright.  [Illustration: FIG. 274.--Ivory jigger for polar cod. 3/4]This fishery begins with the return of the sun, about the 1st ofFebruary, and continues when the ice is favorable until the season isso far advanced that the ice has begun to melt and become rotten. Thefish are especially to be found in places where there is a good-sizedfield of the season’s ice, 3 or 4 feet thick, inclosed by hummocks,and they sometimes occur in very great numbers. In 1882 there was alarge field of this kind about 2 miles from the village and thefishing was carried on with great success, but in 1883 the ice was somuch broken that the fish were very scarce. Some lads caught a fewearly in the season, but the fishery was soon abandoned.A hole about a foot in diameter is made through the ice with an icepick, and the fragments dipped out either with the long-handledwhalebone scoop, or the little dipper made of two pieces of antlermounted on a handle about 2 feet long, which everybody carries in thewinter. The line is unreeled and let down through the hole till thejigs hang about a foot from the bottom. The fisherman holds in hisleft hand the dipper above mentioned, with which he keeps the holeclear of the ice crystals, which form very quickly, and in his rightthe reel which he jerks continually up and down. The fish, attractedby the white “jiggers,” begin nosing around them, when the upward jerkof the line hooks one of them in the under jaw or the belly. As soonas the fisherman feels the fish, he catches a bight of the line withthe scoop in his left hand and draws it over to the left; then catchesthe line below this with the reel and draws it over to the right, andso on, thus reeling the line up in long hanks on these two sticks,without touching the wet line with his fingers.When the fish is brought to the surface of the ice, he is detachedfrom the barbless hook with a dextrous jerk, and almost instantlyfreezes solid. The elastic whalebone line is thrown off the stickwithout kinking and let down again through the hole. When fish areplentiful, they are caught as fast as they can be hauled up, sometimesone on each “jigger.” If the fisherman finds no fish at the first holehe moves to another part of the field and tries again until hesucceeds in “striking a school.” The fish vary in abundance ondifferent days, being sometimes so plentiful that I have known two orthree children to catch a bushel in a few hours, while some days veryfew are to be taken. In addition to the polar cod, a few sculpins arealso caught, and occasionally the two species of Lycodes (L. turneriiand coccineus) which voracious fish sometimes seize the little polarcod struggling on the “jigger” and are thus caught themselves. Thisfishery is chiefly carried on by the women, children, and old men, whogo out in parties of five or six, though the hunters sometimes gofishing when they have nothing else to do. There were generally thirtyor forty people out at the fishing-ground every day in 1882.Jiggers of this pattern appear to be used at Pitlekaj, fromNordendskiöld’s description[N388], but I have seen no account eitherthere or elsewhere of the peculiar method of reeling up the line suchas we saw at Point Barrow. Lines of whalebone are very common amongthe Eskimo generally,[N389] and perhaps this material is preferable toany other for fishing in this cold region, for not only does theelastic whalebone prevent kinking, but the ice which forms instantlyon the wet line in winter does not adhere to it, but can easily beshaken off. No. 56545 [410] is a line 51 feet and 10 inches long and0.05 inch in diameter, made of human hair, neatly braided in a roundbraid with four strands. This was called a fishing line, but was theonly one of the kind seen. Fishhooks of the kind described, with abody of bone or ivory, which serves for a lure, armed with a spur orbent hook of metal, without a barb, seem to be the prevailing typeamongst the Eskimo. In the region about Norton Sound (as shown by theextensive collections of Mr. Nelson and others) this is oftenconverted into an elaborate lure by attaching pendants of beads, bitsof the red beak of the puffin, etc. Crantz mentions a similar customin Greenland of baiting a hook with beads.[N390]    [Footnote N388: Vega, vol. 2, p. 110.]    [Footnote N389: “Their Lines are made of Whalebones, cut very    small and thin, and at the End tacked together.” Egede, Greenland,    p. 107. See also, Crantz, vol. 1, p. 95; Dall, Alaska, p. 148; and    the Museum Collections which contain many whalebone lines from the    Mackenzie and Anderson rivers, collected by MacFarlane, and from    the whole western region, collected by Nelson.]    [Footnote N390: “Instead of a bait, they put on the hook a white    bone, a glass bead, or a bit of red cloth” (when fishing for    sculpins). History of Greenland, vol. 1, p. 95.]  [Illustration: FIG. 275.--Section of whalebone net. 1/3]_Nets (Kubra)._--The most important fishery at the rivers is carriedon by means of gill-nets, set under the ice, and visited every fewdays. In these are taken large numbers of all three species ofwhitefish (Coregonus kenicotti, C. nelsoni, and C. laurettæ.) Thecollection contains three specimens of these nets, two of whaleboneand one of sinew. No. 56754 [147], Fig. 275, is a typical whalebonenet. It is long and shallow, 79 meshes long and 21 deep, made of finestrips of whalebone fastened together as in the whalebone fishinglines. Most of the whalebone is black, but a few light colored stripsare intermixed at random. The length of the mesh is 3¼ inches, and theknot used in making them is the ordinary netting-knot. When not in usethe net is rolled up into a compact ball and tied up with a bit ofstring. When set, this net is 21 feet 7 inches long and 3 feet 4inches deep. The other whalebone net (No. 56753 [172], also fromUtkiavwĭñ), is similar to this, but slightly larger, being 87 meshes(25 feet) long and 22 (3 feet 9 inches) deep. The length of mesh is 3½inches. Fig. 276 (unit of web) is a net (No. 56752 [171] from the samevillage) of the same mesh and depth, but 284 meshes (60 feet) long andmade of twisted sinew twine.  [Illustration: FIG. 276.--Mesh of sinew net. 1/2]I had no opportunity of seeing the method of setting these nets underthe ice, but it is probably the same as that used in setting the sealnets. When in camp at Pernyû in the summer, the natives set these netsin the shoal water of Elson Bay, at right angles to the beach, with astake at each end of the net. They are set by a man in a kayak, and inthem are gilled considerable numbers of whitefish, two species ofsalmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha and O. nerka) and an occasional trout(Salvelinus malma). They take these nets east with them on theirsummer expeditions, but we did not learn the method of using them atthis season. Perhaps they are sometimes used for seining on the beach,as Thomas Simpson says that the Eskimo at Herschel Island (probablyKûñmûd´lĭñ) sold his party “some fine salmon trout, taken in a seineof whalebone, which they dragged ashore by means of several slenderpoles spliced together to a great length.”[N391]    [Footnote N391: Narrative, p. 115.]An Utkiavwĭñ native told us that he found trout (Salvelinus malma) soplentiful at or near the mouth of the Colville, in 1882, that he fedhis dogs with them.  [Illustration: FIG. 277.--Fish trap. 1/23]Fig. 277 is a peculiar net or fish-trap (No. 56755 [190]) fromUtkiavwĭñ, the only specimen of the kind seen. It is a conical,wide-mouthed bag, 8 feet 4 inches long and 5½ feet wide at the mouth,netted all in one piece of twisted sinew, with a 2¼-inch mesh. Thiswas brought over for sale at an early date, before we were wellacquainted with the natives, and we only learned that it was setpermanently for catching fish. Unfortunately, we never saw anotherspecimen, and through the press of other duties never happened to makefurther inquiries about it. From its shape it would appear as if itwere meant to be set in a stream with the mouth towards the current.This contrivance is called sápotĭn, which corresponds to theGreenlandic saputit, a dam for catching fish.From all accounts, the natives east of the Anderson River region wereignorant of the use of the net before they made the acquaintance ofthe whites,[N392] though they now use it in several places, as inGreenland and Labrador. The earliest explorers on the northwest coast,however, found both fish and seal nets in use, though, as I havealready mentioned, the seal net was spoken of at Point Barrow as acomparatively recent invention. At the present day, nets are used allalong the coast from the Mackenzie and Anderson rivers (seeMacFarlane’s Collection) as far south at least as the Yukondelta.[N393] I have not been able to learn whether gill nets are usedin the delta of the Kuskoquim. Petroff[N394] mentions fish traps anddip nets merely. That the natives of Kadiak formerly had no nets Iinfer from Petroff’s statement[N395] that “of late they have begun touse seines of whale sinew.” Nets are generally used on the Siberiancoast. We observed them ourselves at Plover Bay, and Nordenskiöld[N396]describes the nets used at Pitlekaj, which are made of sinew thread.It is almost certain that the American Eskimo learned the use of thenet from the Siberians, as they did the habit of smoking, since theuse of the gill net appears to have been limited to precisely thesame region as the Siberian form of tobacco pipe.[N397]    [Footnote N392: The Greenlanders used a sort of sieve or scoop    net, not seen at Point Barrow, for catching caplin (Mallotus    villosus). Egede, Greenland, p. 108; and Crantz, vol. 1, p. 95.    John Davis, however, says of the Greenlanders in 1586, “They make    nets to take their fish of the finne of a whale.” Hakluyt’s    Voyages, etc. (1589), p. 782.]    [Footnote N393: Dall, Alaska, p. 147; and Petroff, Report, etc.,    p. 127.]    [Footnote N394: Op cit., p. 73.]    [Footnote N395: Op cit., p. 142.]    [Footnote N396: Vega, vol. 2, p. 109.]    [Footnote N397: See the writer’s paper in the American    Anthropologist, vol. 1, pp. 325-336.]  [Illustration: FIG. 278.--Fish spear. 1/8]_Spears._--The only evidence which we have of the use of spears forcatching fish in this region is a single specimen, No. 89901 [1227],Fig. 278, from Utkiavwĭñ, which was newly and rather carelessly madefor sale, but intended, as we were told, for spearing fish. This has aroughly whittled shaft, of spruce, 21½ inches long, armed at one endwith three prongs. The middle prong is of whalebone, 4⅓ inches long,inserted into the tip of the shaft, which is cut into a short neck andwhipped with sinew. The side prongs are also of bone, 9 inches long.Through the tip of each is driven a sharp, slender slightly recurvedspur of bone, about 1½ inches long. Each prong is fastened to theshaft with two small wooden treenails, and they are braced with afigure-of-eight lashing of sinew through holes in the side prongs andaround the middle one. The side prongs are somewhat elastic, so thatwhen the spear is struck down on the back of a fish they spring apartand allow the middle prong to pierce him, and then spring back so thatthe spurs either catch in his sides or meet below his belly, preciselyon the principle of the “patent eel spear.” This implement is almostidentical with one in the National Museum from Hudson Bay, whichappears to be in general use among the eastern Eskimo.[N398] The name,kăki´bua, is very nearly the same as that used by the eastern natives(kākkĭe-wĕi, Parry, and kakívak, Kumlien). This spear is admirablyadapted for catching large fish in shallow rocky streams where a netcan not be used, or where they are caught by dams in tidal streams inthe manner described by Egede and Crantz. There is so little tide,however, on the northwest coast, that this method of fishing can notbe practiced, and, as far as I know, there is no locality in the rangeof the Point Barrow natives, a region of open shoal beaches, andrivers free of rocks, where this spear could be used in which a netwould not serve the purpose much better. Taking into consideration thescarcity of these spears and the general use of nets, I am inclined tobelieve that this spear is an ancient weapon, formerly in general use,but driven out of fashion by the introduction of nets.    [Footnote N398: Kumlien’s description (Contributions, p. 37,    Cumberland Gulf) would apply almost word for word to this spear,    and Captain Parry, (Second Voyage, p. 509) describes a very    similar one in use at Iglulik. The “Perch, headed with two    sharp-hooked Bones,” for spearing salmon--called in the Grenlandsk    Ordbog, kakiak, “en Lyster (med to eller tre Pigge)”--mentioned by    Egede (Greenland, p. 108) is probably the same thing, and a    similar spear is spoken of by Rae (Narrative, p. 172) as in use at    Repulse Bay. A similar weapon, described by Dr. Rink as “Mit einem    in brittischen Columbien vorkommenden identisch,” was found in    east Greenland (Deutsche Geographische Blätter, vol. 9, p. 234).    See the description of the spear found by Schwatka at Back’s Great    Fish River (Nimrod in the North, p. 139), also described by    Klutschak (Als Eskimo, etc., p. 120).]FLINT WORKING.These people still retain the art of making flint arrow andspearheads, and other implements such as the blades for the skinscrapers to be hereafter described. Many of the flint arrowheads andspear points already described were made at Nuwŭk or Utkiavwĭñespecially for sale to us and are as finely formed and neatly finishedas any of the ancient ones. The flints, in many cases water-wornpebbles, appear to have been splintered by percussion into fragmentsof suitable sizes, and these sharp-edged spalls are flaked into shapeby means of a little instrument consisting of a short, straight rod ofsome hard material mounted in a short curved haft. We collected nineof these tools (kĭ´gli) of which two have no blades. No. 89262 [1223]figured in Point Barrow Report, Ethnology, Pl. III, Fig. 7, has beenselected as the type. The handle is of walrus ivory, 7.8 inches long,straight and nearly cylindrical for about 4½ inches, then bending downlike a saw handle and spread out into a spatulate butt. Fitted into adeep groove on the top of the handle so that its tip projects 1.8inches beyond the tip of the latter is a slender four-sided rod ofwhale’s bone, 4.7 inches long. This is held in place by two simplelashings, one of cotton twine and the other of seal thong. The flintto be flaked is held in the left hand and pressed against the fleshypart of the palm which serves as a cushion and is protected by wearinga thick deer-skin mitten. The tool is firmly grasped well forward inthe right hand with the thumb on top of the blade and by pressing thepoint steadily on the edge of the flint, flakes of the desired sizeare made to fly off from the under surface.These tools vary little in pattern, but are made of differentmaterials. Hard bone appears to have been the commonest material forthe blade, as three out of the seven blades are of this substance. Onespecimen (No. 89263 [796] from Utkiavwĭñ) has a blade of iron of thesame shape but only 2 inches long. No. 89264 [1001] also fromUtkiavwĭñ, Fig. 279_a_, has a short blade of black flint flaked into afour-sided rod 1½ inches long. This is held in place by a whipping ofstout seal thong tightened by thrusting a splinter of wood in at theback of the groove.  [Illustration: FIG. 279.--Flint flakers. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 280.--Haft of flint flaker. 1/2]Two specimens (Nos. 89260 [794] Fig. 279_b_ and 89261 [1216] both fromUtkiavwĭñ) have blades of the peculiar Nuɐsuknan concretionspreviously described. Each is an oblong pebble wedged into the grooveand secured by a lashing as usual. No. 89260 [794] has a haft ofantler. This is rather the commonest material for the haft. Twospecimens have hafts of walrus ivory and three of fossil ivory. Thelength of the haft is from 6 to 8 inches, of the blade 1.5 to 4.7inches. Fig. 280 (No. 89265 [979] from Nuwŭk) is the haft of one ofthese tools, made of fossil ivory, yellow from age and stained brownin blotches, which shows the way in which the groove for the blade wasexcavated, namely, by boring a series of large round holes and cuttingaway the material between them. The remains of the holes are still tobe seen in the bottom of the groove. The tip of this haft has beenroughly carved into a bear’s head with the eyes and nostrils incisedand filled with black dirt, and the eyes, nostrils, and mouth of ahuman face have been rudely incised on the under side of the butt andalso blackened. All this carving is new and was done with the view ofincreasing the market value of the object. The original ornamentationconsists of an incised pattern on the upper surface of the butt,colored with red ocher which has turned black from age and dirt.Fig. 281 (No. 89782 [1004_e_]) is one of these tools, very neatlymade, with a haft of reindeer antler and a bone blade, secured by awhipping of seal thong which belongs with the “kit” of tools owned bythe “inland” native, Ilû´bw’ga. Mr. Nelson collected a number ofspecimens of this tool at various points on the northwest coast fromPoint Hope as far south as Norton Bay, but I can find no evidence ofits use elsewhere.  [Illustration: FIG. 281.--Flint flaker with bone blade. 1/3]FIRE MAKING._Drills._--In former times fire was obtained in the method common toso many savages, from the heat developed by the friction of the end ofa stick worked like a drill against a piece of soft wood. Thisinstrument was still in use at least as late as 1837,[N399] butappears to have been wholly abandoned at Point Barrow at the time ofthe _Plover’s_ visit, though still in use at Kotzebue Sound.[N400]    [Footnote N399: “Their own clumsy method of producing fire is by    friction with two pieces of dry wood in the manner of a    drill.”--(T. Simpson, Narrative, p. 162.)]    [Footnote N400: Dr. Simpson, op. cit., p. 242.]  [Illustration: FIG. 282.--Fire drill with mouthpiece and stock. 1/6]A native of Nuwŭk one day brought down for sale what he said was anexact model of the ancient fire drill, nióotĭñ. This is No. 89822[1080], Fig. 282. The drill is a stick of pine 12 inches long, shapedlike the shaft of a common perforating drill, brought to a blunt butrounded point. This is worked by a string, without bow or handles,consisting of a strip of the skin of the bearded seal, 40 inches long,and has for a mouthpiece the astragalus bone of a reindeer, thenatural hollow on one side serving as a socket for the butt of thedrill.[N401] The point of the drill is made to work against the splitsurface of a stick of spruce 18 inches long, along the middle of whichis cut a gash, to give the drill a start. Three equidistant circularpits, charred and blackened, were bored out by the tip of the drill,which developed heat enough to set fire to the sawdust produced.Tinder was probably used to catch and hold the fire.    [Footnote N401: Compare Nordenskiöld’s figure of the fire drill in    use at Pitlekaj (Vega, vol. 2, p. 121), which has a similar bone    for a socket, held not in the mouth but in the left hand.]Most authors who have treated of the Eskimo have described aninstrument of this sort in use either in former times or at thepresent day.[N402]    [Footnote N402: Bessels, Naturalist, vol. 18, pt. 9, p. 867,    speaks of a fire drill used at Smith Sound with a bow and a    mouthpiece of ivory.    A Greenlander; seen by John Davis, in 1586, “beganne to kindle a    fire, in his manner: he took a piece of a boord, wherein was a    hole halfe thorow: into that he puts the end of a roũd sticke like    unto a bedstaffe, wetting the end thereof in traine, and in    fashion of a turner, with a piece of lether, by his violent motion    doth very speedily produce fire.”--Hakluyt’s Voyages, etc. (1589),    p. 782.    “They take a short Block of dry Fir Tree, upon which they rub    another Piece of hard Wood, till by the continued Motion the Fir    catches Fire.”--Egede, Greenland, p. 137.    “If their fire goes out, they can kindle it again by turning round    a stick very quick with a string through a hole in a piece of    wood.”--Crantz, History of Greenland, vol. 1, p. 145.    Lyon (Journal, p. 210) says that at Iglulik they were able to    procure “fire by the friction of a pin of wood in the hole of    another piece and pressed down like a drill from above.” This was    worked with a bow and willow catkins were used for tinder. A man    informed them that “he had learned it from his father rather for    amusement than for utility; the two lumps of iron pyrites    certainly answering the purpose a great deal better.”    “They have a very dextrous Method of kindling Fire; in order to    which, they prepare two small Pieces of dry Wood, which having    made flat, they next make a small Hole in each, and having fitted    into these Holes a little cylindrical Piece of Wood, to which a    Thong is fastened, they whirl it about thereby with such a    Velocity, that by rubbing the Pieces of Wood one against the    other, this Motion soon sets them on fire.”--Ellis, Voyage to    Hudsons Bay, p. 234.    A picture of the process is given opposite page 132, in which a    man holds the socket, while a woman works the thong (western shore    of Hudson Bay, near Chesterfield Inlet).    Rae also mentions a similar drill used in the same region in 1847    (Narrative, p. 187); and there is a specimen in the National    Museum, collected by MacFarlane, and said to be the kind “in use    until lately” in the Mackenzie and Anderson region.    Dall figures a fire drill with bow and mouthpiece formerly in use    at Norton Sound (Alaska, p. 142); and Hooper (Tents, etc., p. 187)    describes a similar drill at Plover Bay.    From Nordenskiöld’s account (Vega, vol. 2, p. 121) the fire drill    seems to be still generally used by the natives at the Vega’s    winter quarters. He says that the women appeared more accustomed    to the use of the drill than the men, and that a little oil was    put on the end of the drill.]Among most Eskimo, however, a bow is used to work the drill. The onlyexceptions to this rule appears to have been the ancient Greenlandersand the people of Hudson Bay (see the passages from Hakluyt, Crantz,and Ellis, just quoted.) Chamisso, however,[N403] speaks of seeing theAleutians at Unalaska produce fire by means of a stick worked by astring making two turns about the stick and held and drawn with bothhands, with the upper end of the stick turning in a piece of wood heldin the mouth. When a piece of fir was turned against another piece ofthe same wood fire was often produced in a few seconds. This passageappears to have escaped the usually keen observation of Mr. W. H.Dall, who, speaking of the ancient Aleutians, says: “The ‘fiddle-bowdrill’ was an instrument largely used in their carving and workingbone and ivory; but for obtaining fire but two pieces of quarz werestruck together,” etc.[N404]    [Footnote N403: Kotzebue’s Voyage, vol. 3, p. 260.]    [Footnote N404: Contribution to N. A. Ethnology, vol. 1, p. 82.]I had no opportunity of seeing this drill manipulated, but I haveconvinced myself by experiment that the stick or “light-stock,” to useNordenskiöld’s expression, must be held down by one foot, the workmankneeling on the other knee._Flint and steel._--Fire is usually obtained nowadays by striking aspark in the ordinary method from a bit of flint with a steel, usuallya bit of some white man’s tool. Both are carried, as in Dr. Simpson’stime, in a little bag slung around the neck, along with some tindermade of the down of willow catkins mixed with charcoal or perhapsgunpowder. The flints usually carried for lighting the pipe, the onlyones I have seen, are very small, and only a tiny fragment of tinderis lighted which is placed on the tobacco. Lucifer matches(kĭlĭăksagan) were eagerly begged, but they did not appear to careenough for them to purchase them. Our friend Nĭkawáalu, from whom weobtained much information about the ancient customs of these people,told us that long ago, “when there was no iron and no flint”--“savikpíñmût, ánma píñmût”[N405]--they used to get “great fire” by strikingtogether two pieces of iron pyrites. Dr. Simpson speaks[N406] of twolumps of iron pyrites being used for striking fire, but he does notmake it clear whether he saw this at Point Barrow or only at KotzebueSound. Iron pyrites appears to have been used quite generally amongthe Eskimo. Bessels saw it used with quartz at Smith Sound, withwillow catkins for tinder[N407] and Lyon mentions the use of twopieces of the same material, with the same kind of tinder, atIglulik.[N408] Willow catkins are also used for tinder at theCoppermine River.[N409]    [Footnote N405: Compare this with Dr. Simpson’s statement, quoted    above, that stones for arrowheads were brought by the Nunatañmiun    from the Ku´wûk River.]    [Footnote N406: Op. cit., p. 243.]    [Footnote N407: Naturalist, vol. 18, pt. 9, p. 867.]    [Footnote N408: Journal, pp. 210 and 231.]    [Footnote N409: Franklin, First Exped., vol. 2, p. 188.]No. 89825 [1133 and 1722] are some of the catkins used for making thetinder, which were gathered in considerable quantities at the rivers.They are called kĭmmiuru, which perhaps means “little dogs,” as we say“catkins” or “pussy willows.”_Kindlings._--From the same place they also brought home willow twigs,9 inches long, and tied with sinews into bunches or fagots of about adozen or a dozen and a half each, which they said were used forkindling fires. (No. 89824 [1725].)BOW-AND-ARROW MAKING.A complete set of bow-and-arrow tools consists of 4 pieces, viz:a marline spike, two twisters, and a feather setter, as shown in Fig.283, No. 89465 [962], from Utkiavwĭñ. The pieces of this set areperforated and strung on a piece of sinew braid, 4 inches long, with aknot at each end.  [Illustration: FIG. 283.--Set of bow-and-arrow tools. 1/3]_The Marline spike._--This is a flat, four-sided rod of walrus ivory,5-6 inches long, tapering to a sharp rounded point at one end, andtapered slightly to the other, which terminates in a small roundedknob. It is very neatly made from, rather old yellow ivory, andornamented on all four faces with conventional incised patternscolored with red ochre.  [Illustration: FIG. 284.--Marline spike. 1/2]This implement is used in putting on the backing of a bow to raiseparts of the cord when an end is to be passed under and in tucking inthe ends in finishing off a whipping. It was probably also used inputting whippings or seizings on any other implements. We collected 10of these tools, all quite similar, and made of walrus ivory, yellowfrom age and handling. They vary in length from 4½ to 6 inches, andare always contracted at the upper end into a sort of neck or handle,surmounted by a knob or crossbar. No. 89463 [836] Fig. 284, fromUtkiavwĭñ has the crossbar carved very neatly into the figure of anAmphipod crustacean without the legs. The eyes, mouth, and vent areindicated by small round holes filled with some black substance, andthere is a row of eight similar holes down the middle of the back. Thetip of this tool, which is 5.9 inches long, has been concaved to anedge so as to make a feather-setter of it. Through the knob at thebutt there is sometimes a large round eye, as in Fig. 285 (No. 89464[842] from Utkiavwĭñ, 4.7 inches long). These tools are sometimesplain, like the specimens last figured, and sometimes ornamented withconventional patterns of incised lines, colored with red ocher, likethe others.  [Illustration: FIG. 285.--Marline spike.]_The twisters_ (No. 89465 [962]) are flat four-sided rods of walrusivory, respectively 4.4 and 4.7 inches long. At each end one broadface is raised into a low transverse ridge about 0.1 inch high and theother rounded off, with the ridge on opposite faces at the two ends.They are ornamented on all four faces with longitudinal incised lines,colored with red ocher.The use of these tools, which was discovered by actual experimentafter our return to this country[N410] is for twisting the strands ofthe sinew backing after it has been put on the bow into the cablesalready described. The manner in which this tool is used is asfollows: The end is inserted between the strands at the middle of thebow, so that the ridge or hook catches the lower strands, and the endis carried over through an arc of 180°, which gives the cable a halfturn of twist. This brings the twister against the bow, so that thetwisting can be carried no further in this direction, and if the toolwere to be removed for a fresh start the strands would have to be heldor fastened in some way, making the process a slow one. Instead, thetool is slid back between the strands till the other end comes wherethe first was, so that the hook at this end catches the strand, andthe workman can give to the cable another half turn of twist. This iscontinued until the cable is sufficiently twisted, the tool slidingback and forth like the handle of a vise. The tools are used in pairs,one being inserted in each cable and manipulated with each hand, so asto give the same amount of twist to each cable. At the present day,these tools are seldom used for bow making, since the sinew-backed bowis so nearly obsolete, but are employed in playing a game of thenature of pitch-penny. (See below, under games and pastimes.)    [Footnote N410: See the writer’s paper on Eskimo bows, Smithsonian    Report for 1884, pt. 2, p. 315.]These tools, of which we collected twenty-six specimens, are all ofwalrus ivory, and of almost exactly the same shape, varying a littlein size and ornamentation. They vary in length from 3 to 5.7 inches,but are usually about 4½ inches long. The commonest width is 0.4inches, the narrowest being 0.3 and the widest 0.7 broad, while thethickness is almost always 0.3, varying hardly 0.1 inch. Most of themare plain, but a few are ornamented with incised lines, and two aremarked with “circles and dots” as in Fig. 286, one of a rather largepair (No. 56521 [249] from Utkiavwĭñ). These are 5.4 inches long,neatly made and quite clean. All the others show signs of age and use.  [Illustration: FIG. 286.--Twister for working sinew backing of bow.  3/4]There are large numbers of these tools in the National Museum fromvarious points in the region where bows of the Arctic type are used,namely, from the Anderson River to Norton Sound, and one from St.Lawrence Island, whence we have received no twisted bows. Their usewas, however, not definitely understood, as they are described simplyas “bow tools,” “bow string twisters” or even “arrow polishers.” Mr.Nelson informs me that the tool is now not used in Norton Sound,except for playing a game, as at Point Barrow, but that the nativestold him that they were formerly used for tightening the backing on abow and also for twisting the hard-laid sinew cord, which is quite asmuch, if not more, used at Norton Sound as the braid so common atPoint Barrow. I find no mention of the use of this tool in any of theauthors who have treated of the Eskimo, except the following in Capt.Beechey’s vocabulary, collected at Kotzebue Sound: “Marline spike,small of ivory, for lacing bows--ke-poot-tak.” The specimens from theMackenzie and Anderson rivers are almost without exception made ofhard bone, while walrus ivory is the common material elsewhere. Thename (kaputɐ) means simply a “twister.”_The feather-setter_ (_ĭ´gugwau_) (No. 89465 [962]) is a flat,slender, rounded rod of walrus ivory, 7 inches long, with the tipabruptly concaved to a thin, rounded edge. The faces are ornamentedwith a pattern of straight incised lines, colored with red ocher. Thistool is used for squeezing the small ends of the feathering into thewood of the arrow shaft close to the nock. Fig. 287 is a similar tool(No. 89486 [1285] from Utkiavwĭñ) also of walrus ivory, 6 inches long,with the upper end roughly whittled to a sharp point. It is probablymade of a broken seal indicator or meat-cache marker. Several otherivory tools previously mentioned have been concaved to an edge at thetip so that they can be used as feather-setters. I do not find thistool mentioned by previous observers, nor have I seen any specimens inthe National Museum.  [Illustration: FIG. 287.--“Feather-setter.” 1/2]Fig. 288 (No. 89459 [1282] from Utkiavwĭñ) represents an unusual tool,the use of which was not ascertained in the hurry of trade. It has apoint like that of a graver, and is made of reindeer antler,ornamented with a pattern of incised lines and bands, colored with redocher, and was perhaps a marline spike for working with sinew cord.  [Illustration: FIG. 288.--Tool of antler. 1/2]SKIN-WORKING._Scrapers (ikun)._--For removing bits of flesh, fat, etc., from a“green” skin, and for “breaking the grain” and removing thesubcutaneous tissue from a dried skin, the women, who appear to domost if not all of this work, use a tool consisting of a blunt stoneblade, mounted in a short, thick haft of wood or ivory, fittingexactly to the inside of the hand and having holes or hollows toreceive the tips of the fingers and thumb. The skin is laid upon thethigh and thoroughly scraped with this tool, which is grasped firmlyin the right hand and pushed from the worker. This tool is also usedfor softening up skins which have become stiffened from being wet andthen dried. The teeth appear to be less often used for such purposesthan among the eastern Eskimo.  [Illustration: FIG. 289.--Skin scraper. 1/2]We obtained eighteen such scrapers, some without blades, and twounmounted blades. Every woman owns one of these tools. While they areall of the same general model, they vary a good deal in details. Fourdifferent forms or subtypes have been recognized in the seriescollected, all modifications of the form seen in Fig. 289, No. 89313[955], which may be called the type. The blade is of brown jasper,rather coarsely flaked, 1.1 inches long. It is wedged with pieces ofskin, into a deep slot in the tip of the handle, which is of fossilivory, slightly yellowed from handling. The left side against whichthe thumb rests is slightly flattened, and the right slightlyexcavated to receive the third and fourth fingers, which are bentround under the lobe, their tips pressing against the concave undersurface of the latter. The fore and middle fingers rest upon the uppersurface.  [Illustration: FIG. 290.--Skin scrapers--handles only. 1/2]No. 89320 [1171] from Utkiavwĭñ, without a blade, is of the samegeneral pattern, but is slightly excavated on the left as well as theright side so as to make a sort of shank. It is of fossil ivory,stained a dingy orange from age and grease. The two incised circlesand dots on the upper surface close to the slot make the end of thehandle look like the head of a Lophius, which it is perhaps meant torepresent. No. 89321 (858), an old fossil ivory handle, has the leftside slightly hollowed to receive the tip of the thumb, and a mediankeel on the upper surface with a barely perceptible hollow on eachside of it for the tips of the fingers. This is a step toward thesecond subtype as shown in Fig. 290 (No. 89317 [748] from Utkiavwĭñ,which has no blade). This is of fossil ivory, thicker and morestrongly arched than the type described, deeply excavated below so asto form a broad lobe at the butt, with the upper surface deeplygrooved to receive the tips of the fore and middle fingers, and aslight hollow on the left side for the thumb. This specimen is veryneatly made and polished, and all the edges are rounded off. One-halfof the handle (lengthwise) and the outer quarter of the other half arestained with age and grease a beautiful amber brown. This specimen wassaid to be as old as the time when men wore but one labret.  [Illustration: FIG. 291.--Skin scrapers. 1/2]The only essential difference between this subtype and the precedingis that the former has deep grooves or hollows for the thumb and twofingers. We collected five specimens of this pattern, all but one withhandles of fossil ivory. The single exception, which came from Sidaru,has a handle of walrus ivory, yellowed with age and grease. Thisspecimen (Fig. 291_a_, No. 89322 [1426]) has an unusually short blade(only 0.4 inch long), and is much cut out on the right side so as tomake a sort of nick. Fig. 291_b_ (No. 89314 [1780]) is a nearly newhandle of this pattern, which was bought of the “Nunatañmiun,” whocame to Pernyû in 1883. It is very highly ornamented, both withincised patterns, colored black, and by carving the space between theunusually deep thumb hollow and those for the fingers into what seemsto be meant for an ear, in high relief, colored red inside.  [Illustration: FIG. 292.--Skin scraper. 1/2]The third subtype has the lobe separated from the body on the rightside only, leaving the left side unexcavated, except by thethumb-hollow, as is shown in Fig. 292 (No. 89316 [1177] fromUtkiavwĭñ) which has a handle of yellowed fossil ivory and a blackflint blade. No. 89310 [1071] Fig. 293, from Utkiavwĭñ, is a ratherunusual modification of this pattern, with a wooden handle, in whichthe bottom is not cut out. The thumb groove is deepened into a largehole which opens into the excavation on the right side, while a largeoblong slot on top, opening into these cavities, takes the place ofthe two finger hollows. The blade was of gray flint and rather longerthan usual.  [Illustration: FIG. 293.--Peculiar modification of scraper. 1/2]The last subtype which, according to my recollection, is the one mostfrequently seen in use at the present day, has the butt producedhorizontally into a broad, flat lobe. The excavation of the right sidemay be continued through to the left in the form of a notch, as shownin Fig. 294 (No. 89315 [1365] from Sidaru) which has a blade of blackflint and a handle of fossil ivory, with hollows for the thumb andfingers; or the left side may be unexcavated except for the thumbgroove as in Fig. 295 (No. 89309 [1135] from Utkiavwĭñ). This specimenhas a rather large wooden handle, with the grooves as before. Itappears, however, to have been remodeled to fit a smaller hand thanthat of the original owner, as the thumb groove has been deepened forabout two-thirds of its original length, and there is a deep, roundhole in the middle of the groove for the second finger. Thepeculiarity of this specimen, however, is that it has a blade ofsandstone, flat and rather thin, with a smooth, rounded edge. Thenatives told us that scraper blades of sandstone were the prevailingform in old times.  [Illustration: FIG. 294.--Skin scraper. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 295.--Skin scraper. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 296.--Skin scraper. 1/2]Fig. 296 (No. 89312 [1336] from Utkiavwĭñ) is another wooden handle,in which the excavation for the third and fourth fingers is merely alarge round hole on the right side, while in front the handle is cutinto two short lobes, between which in a deep groove the forefingerfits. There is a hollow for the thumb under the left lobe and one onthe right for the middle finger. No. 89311 [1079] from the samevillage is almost exactly similar. These are the only two specimens ofthe kind which I recollect seeing. A rather large flint-bladed scraperwith a wooden handle very much the shape of that of No. 89309 [1135]is the tool most generally used at the present day. The blades are allof the same general shape and vary in size from the little one abovementioned (No. 89322 [1426], Fig. 291_a_), only 0.4 inch long, toblades like No. 89612 [820], Fig. 297, from Utkiavwĭñ. This is newlymade from light gray translucent flint and is 5 inches long. The namekibûgû, applied to this specimen by the native from whom it waspurchased, appears to refer either to the material or the unusualsize. The blade is ordinarily called kuki, “a claw.” With the ivoryhandles a blade about 1 or 1½ inches is commonly used and with thewooden ones a considerably larger one, 2 to 3 inches in length. Thehandles vary in size to fit the hands of the owners, but are all toosmall for an average white man’s hand. All that we collected are forthe right hand.  [Illustration: FIG. 297.--Flint blade for skin scraper.]This pattern of skin scraper which appears from the Museum collectionsto be the prevailing one from Point Barrow to Norton Sound, isevidently the direct descendant of the form used still farther south,which consists of a stone or bone blade of the same shape, mounted ona wooden handle often a foot or 18 inches long, which has the otherend bent down into a handle like the butt of a pistol. Shortening thishandle (a process shown by specimens in the Museum) would bring theworker’s hand nearer to the blade, thus enabling him to guide itbetter. Let this process be continued till the whole handle is shortenough to be grasped in the hand and we have the first subtypedescribed, of which the others are clearly improvements.A still more primitive type of scraper is shown by Fig. 298, No. 89651[1295] from Utkiavwĭñ, the only specimen of the kind seen. This has aflint blade, like those of the modern scrapers, inserted in the largerend of a straight haft of reindeer antler, 5½ inches long. We did notlearn the history of this tool in the hurry of trade, but from theshape of the blade it is evidently a scraper. Its use as a skinscraper is rendered still more probable by the fact that the scrapersused by some of the eastern Eskimo (there are specimens in the Museumfrom Cumberland Gulf and Pelly Bay) have straight handles, thoughshorter than this.  [Illustration: FIG. 298.--Straight-hafter scraper.]The Siberian natives use an entirely different form of scraper whichhas a long handle like that of a spoke-shave with a small blade ofstone or iron in the middle and is worked with both hands.[N411] Fig.299 (No. 89488 [1578] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a tool which we never saw inuse but which we were told was intended for scraping skins. It isprobably an obsolete tool, as a knife would better serve the purposeof removing the subcutaneous tissue, etc., while the stone scrapersjust described are better for softening the skin.    [Footnote N411: Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2, pp. 122, and Fig. 1,    p. 117.]It is the distal end of the “cannon” bone or metacarpal, of areindeer, 6.2 inches long, with the two condyles forming the handle.At the other end the posterior face of the shaft is chamfered off soas to expose the medullary cavity for about 2½ inches, leaving a sharpedge on each side. The tip is roughly broken off. The tool appears tobe old but the two condyles have been recently carved rudely into twohuman faces, one male (with marks for labrets) and the other female.There is a somewhat similar tool in the Museum brought by Mr. Nelsonfrom Norton Sound.  [Illustration: FIG. 299.--Bone scraper. 1/2]_Scraper cups (óhovwĭñ)._--In removing the last of the blubber fromthe skins of seals or walruses when they wish to save the oil, theyscrape it off with a little oblong cup of walrus ivory with a sharpedge at one or both ends. The cup, of course, catches the oil which istransferred to a dish. These cups are sometimes, I believe, also usedfor dipping oil. We collected ten of these cups, of which No. 89251[1287], Fig. 300_a_, will serve as the type. This is 3.7 inches long,carved out of a single piece of walrus ivory, and worked down from theinside to a sharp edge on each end. The carving is smoothly done onthe outside, but more roughly within, where it is somewhat hacked. Itis stained a dark yellow with oil and polished on the outside,probably by much handling. Fig. 300_b_ (No. 89258 [1090] also fromUtkiavwĭñ) is a similar cup, but has a sharp edge only at one endwhich is cut out in a concave curve.  [Illustration: FIG. 300.--Scraper cups. 1/2]The ten cups in the collection are all about the same shape and sizeand all of walrus ivory, stained yellow with oil. The largest is 4inches long and 2¾ wide, and the smallest, 3 by 2.1 inches. Themajority are about 3½ by 2½ inches. Five of the ten have sharp edgesat both ends, the rest at one only. Mr. Nelson brought home specimensof this implement from Point Hope and St. Lawrence Island, but I donot find it mentioned elsewhere.With these tools and their knives, they do all the work of preparingskins for clothing, boat covers, etc. I had no opportunity of seeingthe process in all its stages, and can therefore give only a generalaccount of it. Deerskins are always dressed as furs, with the hair on.The skin is rough-dried in the open air, with considerablesubcutaneous tissue adhering to it, and laid aside until needed. Whenwanted for use, a woman takes the skin and works it over carefullywith a stone scraper on the flesh side, removing every scrap ofsubcutaneous tissue and “breaking the grain” of the skin, which leavesa surface resembling white chamois leather and very soft. This is thenrubbed down with a flat piece of sandstone or gypsum, and finally withchalk, so that when finished it seems like pipeclayed leather. Allfurs are prepared in the same way. Small seal skins to be worn withthe hair on are scraped very clean and, I think, soaked in urine,before they are spread out to dry. The black waterproof seal skin hasthe hair shaved off close to the skin, great care being taken to leavethe epidermis intact, and also has a certain amount of tanning inurine. It is probable that a little of the blubber is left on theseskins, to make them oily and waterproof.When, however they wish to prepare the white-tanned seal skin, theskins are brought into the warm house, thawed out or dampened and thenrolled up and allowed to ferment for several days, so that when theyare unrolled hair and epidermis are easily scraped off together. Theskin is then soaked in urine, stretched on a large hoop, and put outto dry in the sun and air. Many of these skins are prepared during thefirst sunny weather in the early spring. The skins of the large seal,walrus or bear when used for boat-covers or boot soles appear to besweated in the same way, as the epidermis is always removed. We didnot learn whether urine was employed on these skins, but I think fromtheir ordinary appearance that they are simply stretched and dried intheir own fat, as appears to be the case with the skin of the beluga,from which the epidermis is easily scraped without sweating.[N412]    [Footnote N412: Crantz describes the process of preparing boat    covers as follows: “The boat skins are selected out of the    stoutest seals’ hides, from which the fat is not quite taken off;    they roll them up, and sit on them, or let them lie in the sun    covered with grass several weeks, ’till the hair will come off.”    History of Greenland, vol. 1, p. 167.]_Combs for deerskins._--The loosened hairs on a deerskin garment areremoved by means of a comb made of a section of the beam of an antler,hollowed out and cut into teeth on the end. This instrument probablyserves also to remove vermin, as its name “kúmotĭn” looks very much asif derived from kúmûk, louse. I must say, however, that the nativeswhom I asked if kúmotĭn had anything to do with kúmûk said it had not.When vermin get troublesome in a garment, it is taken out on thetundra, away from the houses, and beaten with rods like a carpet. Veryold garments when much infested with lice are taken out back of thevillage, cut into small pieces, and burned. It is no uncommon sight inthe spring to see an old woman sitting out on the tundra, busy withher knife cutting up old clothes.We brought home nine of these combs, of which No. 89354 [1879], Fig.301_a_, has been selected as the type. It is 4¼ inches long and hassixteen teeth about 1 inch long. The small holes near the other endare for a lanyard to hang it up by.  [Illustration: FIG. 301.--Combs for cleaning deerskins. 1/2]Six of these combs have teeth at one end only, the other three at bothends. These teeth are generally about fifteen in number, and 1 inch ora little over long. No. 89781 [1005], a very small comb only 2.9inches long, which belonged to the “inland” native Ilûbw’ga, hastwenty teeth 0.6 inch long. These combs are usually about 4 or 4½inches long. No. 89556 [1017], Fig. 301_b_, from Utkiavwĭñ is anunusually long comb, 5.3 inches long, which is peculiar in being solidexcept at the end which is cut into teeth.Fig. 301_c_ (No. 89359 [993]), from Utkiavwĭñ is a double-ended comb,having ten teeth on one end and thirteen on the other. It is 4.1inches long and made with considerable care, being ornamented withincised rings colored with red ocher. This is a common implement atPoint Barrow, but seems unusual elsewhere. There is a single specimenfrom the Diomedes in Mr. Nelson’s collection.MANUFACTURE OF LINES OF THONG.No tools are used for this purpose except a knife. I have seen a smalljackknife used for cutting the fine seal skin lines. The workman takesa wet skin from which the hair and epidermis have been removed andsits down cross-legged on the ground with somebody else to hold theskin stretched for him. Then holding the knife vertically up with theedge away from him, he starts at one corner of the skin and cuts anarrow strip in one continuous piece, going round and round the skin,gathering and stretching the strip with the left hand. They do thiswork quite rapidly and with great skill, cutting single lines upwardof 90 feet long and only one-eighth inch in diameter, almost perfectlyeven. These fine lines of seal-skin thong, which serve a great varietyof purposes, are usually made when they are in the summer camps,before the breaking up of the ice. They are dried by stretching thembetween stakes 6 inches or a foot high, driven into the ground.The stout thongs of the hide of the bearded seal, walrus, or belugaare usually made in the winter and stretched to dry between posts ofwhales’ bones set up in the village, about breast high. While they aredrying, the maker carefully trims and scrapes the edges with hisknife, so as to make an almost round line.[N413] The usual diameter isabout 0.3 inch. These lines are not always made with such care, beingoften merely flat thongs. Fine deer-skin twine, or “babiche,” as it iscalled by the voyageurs, for making the nettings of snow shoes, ismade in the same way. A deer skin is dampened, rolled up, and put upover the lamp for a day or two to remove the hair by sweating, andthen cut into a single long piece of fine thong.    [Footnote N413: Gilder describes a similar process of    manufacturing these lines at Hudson’s Bay. (Schwatka’s Search,    p. 176.)]All the men do not appear able to do this fine work. For instance, ourfriend Mû´ñialu had the babiche for his new snowshoes made by hishouse-mate, the younger Tuñazu. When it is desired to fasten togethertwo pieces of the stouter kinds of thong, what I have so oftenreferred to as the “double-slit splice” is generally employed. This ismade as follows: The two ends to be joined together are each slitlengthwise, and one is passed through the slit in the other. The otherend of this piece is then passed through the slit in the first piece,and drawn through so that the sides of each slit interlace like theloops of a square knot (see diagrams, Fig. 302). The splice is oftenfurther secured by a seizing of sinew braid. Most writers on theEskimo have not gone sufficiently into the details of their arts todescribe their methods of splicing. One writer,[N414] however, indescribing some Eskimo implements from East Greenland, describes andfigures several splices somewhat of this nature, and one in particularespecially complicated by crossing the sides of the slits and passingthe end through several times. This method of uniting thongs isprobably very general among the Eskimo and is also common enough amongcivilized people.    [Footnote N414: W. J. Sollas, in Jour. Anthrop. Inst. of Great    Britain and Ireland, vol. 9, pp. 329-336.]  [Illustration: FIG. 302.--Double-slit splice for rawhide lines.]BUILDERS’ TOOLS._For excavating._--At the present day they are very glad to use whitemen’s picks and shovels when they want to dig in the gravel or cleanout the ice from their houses. They, however, have mattocks andpickaxes (síkla) of their own manufacture, which are still in use.These are always single-pointed and have a bone or ivory head, mountedlike an adz head on a rather short haft. The haft, like those of themauls and adzes already described, is never fitted into the head, butalways applied to the under surface of the latter and held on by alashing of thong.  [Illustration: FIG. 303.--Mattock of whale’s rib. 1/8]  [Illustration: FIG. 304.--Pickax heads of bone, ivory, and whale’s  ribs. 1/4]The only complete implement of the kind which we obtained is No. 73574[297], Fig. 303. The head is of whale’s rib, 17¾ inches long. The buttis shouldered on the under surface to receive the haft and roughenedwith crosscuts to prevent slipping, with two shallow rough transversenotches on the upper surface for the lashings. The haft is of pine,24½ inches long. The lashing is of stout thong of bearded seal hide,in two pieces, one of four turns passing through the hole, round thefront edge of the haft, over the lower notch in the head, and backacross the haft to the hole again. The ends are knotted together ontop of the head by becket-hitching one end into an eye in the other,made by slitting it close to the tip and passing a bight of thestanding part through this slit. The other part is of seven turns, puton in the same way, but crossing back of the haft, and started bylooping one end round the head and through the eye by means of an eyeat the end made as before. It is finished off by winding the end threeor four times round these turns, so as to tighten them up, andhitching it round two of them on one side. This method of haftingdiffers in no essential respect from that used on the mauls and adzesabove described.We have also two heads for such mattocks, which hardly differ from theone described, except the No. 56494 [285] has the notches for thelashings on the side of the head instead of on the upper surface. Itis 16 inches long. The other, No. 89843 [1043], Fig. 304_a_, is a veryrude head made of an almost cylindrical piece of rib. This is a veryold tool, which from its oily condition has evidently been long laidaway in some blubber room at Utkiavwĭñ. It is 15.2 inches long.These blunt-pointed mattocks are not so much used at present as pickswith a sharp point mounted in the same way, and specially adapted forworking in ice or hard frozen soil. I have, however, never seen themused for cutting holes in the ice for fishing, which some authors havesupposed to be what they were meant for. Their shape makes them veryinconvenient for any such a purpose, except when the ice is very thin.The ice pick, like those carried on the butt of the spear, is underany circumstances a more serviceable tool. These sharp pickax headsare generally made of a walrus tusk, the natural shape of whichrequires very little alteration to fit it for the purpose. Wecollected three of these ivory heads, all very nearly alike, of whichNo. 56539_b_ [96], Fig. 304_b_, will serve as the type. This is thetip of a good-sized walrus tusk, 14.2 inches long, preserving verynearly the natural outline of the tusk except at the point, where itis rounded off rather more abruptly above. It is keeled along theupper edge and on the lower edge at the point, so that the latter isfour-sided, and the sides of the butt are flattened. On the under sidethe butt is cut off flat for about 3½ inches, leaving a low flange orridge, and roughened with crosscuts to fit the end of the haft, andthe butt is perforated with two large transverse eyes for the lashing.The other two heads are almost exactly like this and very nearly thesame size.Sharp-pointed pick heads of whale’s bone appear also to have beenused, probably at an earlier date than the neatly finished ivory ones,as we collected three such heads, all very old and roughly made, andhaving notches or grooves for the lashings instead of eyes. Fig.304_c_ is one of these, No. 89844 [1315], from Utkiavwĭñ, very rudelycut from a piece of whale’s rib, 12 inches long.I do not recollect seeing any of these bone-headed picks in use, whilethe ivory-headed one was one of the commonest tools. This Eskimo toolis in use at Pitlekaj, a village supposed to be wholly inhabited bysedentary Chukches.[N415]    [Footnote N415: Nordenskiöld’s figures, Vega, vol. 2, p. 123.]TOOLS FOR SNOW AND ICE WORKING._Snow knives._--For cutting the blocks of snow used in building theapu´ya, or snow hut, they at the present day prefer a saw or a largesteel knife (for instance, a whaleman’s boarding knife), if they canprocure it, but they still have many of the large saber-shaped ivoryknives so commonly used by the Eskimo everywhere for this purpose.These are, however, more generally used for scraping snow off theirclothing, etc., at present. We brought home two of these knives, whichdo not differ in any important respect from the many specimenscollected by other explorers in Alaska.  [Illustration: FIG. 305.--Ivory snow knife. 1/4]No. 89478 [759], Fig. 305, is one of these--saviu´ra, “like a knife.”It is of walrus ivory (following the natural outline of the tusk), 16½inches long. The blade is double-edged, the haft rounded on the edgesand laced along the lower edge for 3¼ inches with a double piece ofsinew braid. The object of this is to give the hand a firmer grip onthe haft. These knives are also used for cutting the blocks of snow tosupply the house with water.  [Illustration: FIG. 306.--Snow shovels. 1/8]_Snow shovels._--The broad, short-handled snow shovel of wood with asharp edge of ivory is the tool universally employed whenever snow isto be shoveled, either to clear it away or for excavating houses orpitfalls in the snowdrifts, or “chinking” up the crevices in the wallsof the snow house, and is an indispensable part of the traveler’soutfit in winter. The shovels (pĭ´ksun) are all made on essentiallythe same pattern, which is well shown by Fig. 306_a_, No. 56739 [30].The blade is 14 inches broad and 11 long. The whole upper surface ofthe shovel is flat. The handle is beveled off on the side to a roundededge below, and is quite thick where it joins the blade, tapering offto the tip. The blade is thick and abruptly rounded off on the upperedge below and gradually thinned down to the edge. The edge of thewood is fitted with a tongue into a groove in the top of the ivoryedge, which is 1½ inches deep. It is fastened on by wooden tree-nailsat irregular intervals, and at one end, where the edge of the groovehas been broken, by a stitch of black whalebone. The wooden part ofthe shovel is made of four unequal pieces of spruce, neatly fitted anddoweled together and held by the ivory edge and three stitches ofblack whalebone close to the upper edge, and countersunk below theflat surface. The whippings of sinew braid on the handle are to give afirm grip for the hands.No. 56738 [27], Fig. 306_b_, is a similar shovel of the same materialand almost exactly the same dimensions, figured to show the way it hasbeen pieced together and mended. The maker of this shovel was able toprocure a broad piece of wood which only had to be pieced out with anarrow strip on the left side, which is fastened on as before. It was,however, not long enough to make the whole of the handle, which has apiece 8½ inches long, neatly scarfed on at the end and secured by sixstout treenails of wood; three at each end of the joint, passingthrough the thin part of the scarf into the thick, but not through thelatter. Nearly the whole handle was seized with sinew braid put on asbefore, but much of this seizing is broken off. At the right side ofthe blade the grain takes a twist, bringing it parallel to the ivoryedge, and rendering it liable to split, as has happened from thewarping of the ivory since the shovel has been in the Museum. Theowner sought to prevent this by fastening to the edge a stout “strap”of walrus ivory 4½ inches, which appears to be an old bird spearpoint. The lower end of this fitted into the groove of the ivory edge,and it was held on by three equidistant lashings of narrow whalebone,each running through a hole in the edge of the wood and round theivory in a deep transverse groove.This pattern of snow shovel is very like that from Iglulik, figured byCapt. Lyon,[N416] but the handle of the latter is so much shorter inproportion to the blade that there is an additional handle like thatof a pot lid near the head of the blade on the upper surface. Theivory edge also appears to be fastened on wholly with stitches.    [Footnote N416: Parry’s Second Voy., pl. opposite p. 548, Fig. 5.]Fig. 307 (No. 89775 [1250] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a peculiar implement,the only one of the kind that we saw. It is a shovel, 17 inches long,made of a whale’s scapula, with the anterior and posterior borders cutoff straight so as to make it 13¼ inches broad, and the superiormargin beveled off to an edge. The handle is made by flattening theneck of the scapula and cutting through it a large horizontalelliptical slot, below which the end of the scapula is worked into arounded bar 1 inch in diameter. The cutting around this slot appearsnew, and red ocher has been rubbed into the crevices. On the otherhand, the beveling of the digging edge appeared to be old. Thoughcolored with red ocher, the edge is gapped as if from use, and thereare fragments of tundra moss sticking to it. It is probably an oldimplement “touched up” for sale. We did not learn whether such toolswere now generally used. This may have been a makeshift or anindividual fancy.  [Illustration: FIG. 307.--Snow shovel made of a whale’s scapula.  1/8]Fig. 308 (No. 89521 [1249] from Utkiavwĭñ) is another peculiar tool ofwhich we saw no other specimen. It appears to be really an oldimplement and was said to have been used for digging or picking in thesnow. It is a stout sharp-pointed piece of bone, 3 inches long,inserted in the end of a piece of a long bone of some animal, 4.7inches long and about 1½ wide, which serves as a haft.  [Illustration: FIG. 308.--Snow pick. 1/2]_Ice picks._--The ivory ice pick (tu´u) always attached to theseal-harpoon has been already described. This differs from the _tôk_of the Greenlanders and other eastern Eskimo in having a sharp bayonetpoint, while the latter is often chisel-pointed. All the men now haveiron ice picks which they use for cutting the holes for fishing,setting seal nets, and such purposes. These are made of some whiteman’s tool which has a socket, like a harpoon iron, a whale lance,a boarding knife or bayonet, and usually have a rather slender bladeabout a foot long, mounted on a pole 6 or 8 feet long. The point issharp and polygonal, generally four-sided. The tool is managed withboth hands and used to split off fragments of ice by rather obliqueblows. In other words, it is used in precisely the same way as thelittle single-handed pick which we use in refrigerators. For chiselingoff projecting corners of ice when making a path out through the icepack, they often use whale spades, of which they have obtained a greatmany from wrecks.  [Illustration: FIG. 309.--Snow drill. 1/3]  [Illustration: FIG. 310.--Ice scoop. 1/12]No. 89483 [1313] from Utkiavwĭñ, is a very old pick made of a piece ofreindeer antler, 11¼ inches long, split lengthwise, and tapered to asharp curved point. The butt is cut into a sort of tang with a lowshoulder. The split face is concave, the soft interior tissue havingbeen removed by decay and perhaps also intentionally. Another peculiartool is shown in Fig. 309 (No. 89479 [1064] from Utkiavwĭñ). This wascalled kăkaiyaxion, and is a rounded piece of antler 10.4 inches long,tapering from the butt where there is a low shoulder and the brokenremains of a rounded tang to be fitted to a shaft. One side is cut offflat from the shoulder to the tip, gradually becoming concave. Theconcavity is deepest near the middle. The tip is slightly expanded,rounded, and somewhat bent toward the convex side. The specimen issmoothly and neatly made and dark brown from age. No other specimenswere seen. We were told that this tool was mounted on a long pole andused for drilling holes in the ice by making the pole revolve with thehands._Ice scoops._--When picking a hole through the ice they use along-handled scoop, made of a piece of antler bent round into a hoop,and netted across the bottom with strips of whalebone, so that thewater may drain off in dipping pieces of ice out of the water. Webrought home one specimen of this universal implement (No. 89903[1696], Fig. 310). The handle is of oak, 5 feet 1¾ inches long andelliptical in section. The rim of the bowl is a long thin strip ofantler, apparently from the “palm,” bent round into a pointed oval, 8½inches long and 5¾ wide, with the ends of the strip overlapping about3 inches at the broader end. The ends are sewed together with twovertical stitches of whalebone. The left end has been broken acrossobliquely near the joint and mended with whalebone stitches. Round thelower edge of the rim runs a row of twenty-seven pairs of small holes0.2 inch from the edge. The holes of each pair are connected by a deepchannel, and a narrow shallow groove, probably for ornament, joins thepairs. On the left side are eight extra holes between the pairs, whichare not used. Through these holes, omitting the first two pairs in theright-hand end, is laced a piece of seal thong, thus: Starting at thepoint of the oval, the two ends of the thong are passed through thepair of holes there from the outside and the bight drawn home into thechannel; the ends are crossed, the left end going to the right, andvice versa, and passed out through the farther hole of the next pairand in through the nearer, and so on till the ends meet at the broadend of the oval where they are tied together, thus making twenty-fiveloops on the inside of the rim into which the netting is fastened.This is made of strips of thin whalebone, interwoven, over and undereach other, passing up through one loop and down through the next.There are eleven longitudinal strands passing obliquely from right toleft, the same number from left to right, and eleven transversestrands, making a network with elongated hexagonal apertures. Thestrips are not one continuous piece. The bowl thus made is fastened tothe handle by three pieces of stout seal thong. The whole lashing wasput on wet, and allowed to shrink.Nordenskiöld mentions and figures a scoop of almost identically thesame pattern, but smaller, in general use for the same purposes atPitlekaj.[N417] A smaller scoop or skimmer (ĕlauatĭn) is alsouniversally used. We inadvertently neglected to preserve a specimen ofthis very common implement, though we had two or three about thestation for our own use. I shall therefore have to describe it frommemory. The handle is a flat, straight stick with rounded edges, about18 inches or 2 feet long, 1½ inches broad, and three-fourths inchthick. The bowl is made of two pieces of antler “palm” of such a shapethat when they are fastened together on the end of the stick they makea shallow cup about 3½ inches long by 3 wide, with a longitudinalcrevice along the middle which allows the water to drain off. The tipof the handle is beveled off on both sides so as to fit into theinside of this cup, along the junction of the two pieces, each ofwhich is fastened to it by one or two neat stitches of whalebone. Thetwo pieces are fastened together in front of the handle with a stitch.    [Footnote N417: Vega, vol. 1, p. 493.]In addition to the use of these scoops for skimming the fishing holes,and reeling up the line, as already described, they also serve asscrapers to remove snow and hoar frost from the clothing. In thewinter most of the men and boys, especially the latter, carry theseskimmers whenever they go out doors, partly for the sake of havingsomething in their hands, as we carry sticks, and partly for use. Theboys are very fond of using them to pick up and sling snowballs, bitsof ice, or frozen dirt, which they do with considerable force andaccuracy.IMPLEMENTS FOR PROCURING AND PREPARING FOOD._Blubberhooks_ (nĭ´ksĭgû).--For catching hold of pieces of blubber orflesh when “cutting in” a whale or walrus, or dragging them round onshore or on the ice, or in the blubber rooms, they use hooks made byfastening a backward-pointing prong of ivory on the end of a woodenhandle, which is bent into a crook at the other end. Those speciallyintended for use in the boats have handles 7 or 8 feet long, whilethose for shore use are only 2 or 3 feet long. These implements, whichare common all along the Alaskan coast, may sometimes be used asboathooks, as appears to be the case farther south, though I never sawthem so employed. We brought home two short hooks and one long one,No. 56766 [126], Fig. 311. This has a prong of walrus ivory fastenedto a spruce pole, 7 feet 7¾ inches long, to the other end of which isfastened a short crook of antler. The pole is elliptical in section.The crook is a nearly straight “branch” of an antler with a transversearm at the base made by cutting out a piece of the “beam” to fitagainst the pole, and is held on by three neat lashings of whaleboneof the usual pattern. The upper two of these are transverse lashingspassing through corresponding holes in the pole and crook. The lowest,which is at the tip of the arm, is at right angles to these, passingthrough wood and antler. The lashing of whalebone close to the tip ofthe crook, passing through a hole and round the under side of thelatter, is to keep the hand from slipping off. The prong is held on bytwo lashings of small seal thong, each passing through a largetransverse hole in the prong and a corresponding one in the pole. Theupper pair of holes do not exactly match. There are also two unusedholes, one in the pole below the upper hole and one above the upperhole in the prong. These holes and the new appearance of the lashingsindicate that the prong is part of another hook recently fitted tothis pole. The two lashings are made by a single piece of thong. Thewhole is old and weathered and rather greasy about the prong and thetip of the pole.  [Illustration: FIG. 311.--Long blubber hook. 1/30]  [Illustration: FIG. 312.--Short-handled blubber hook. 1/6]Fig. 312 (No. 89836 [1203] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a similar hook with ashort handle, 34 inches long, for use on land. The crook is made bybending the handle. The prong, of walrus ivory as before, is 7 incheslong, and held on by two stout lashings of whalebone, which pass roundthe end of the handle instead of through it. The prong and tip of thehandle are very greasy.No. 89837 [1353], from the same village, is a similar hook ratherrudely made. The crook is bent only at an angle of about 45°, andthere is somewhat of a twist to the whole handle. The prong, which isof antler, is 7¾ inches long and shouldered at the butt like that ofthe long hook described. It is fastened on by two thick lashings ofstout seal thong passing around prong and handle and kept fromslipping by notches in the latter, and on the butt end of the formerand by a large flat-headed brass stud driven into the prong below theupper lashing._Fish scaler._--Fig. 313 (No. 89461 [1279] from Utkiavwĭñ) representsa little implement which we never saw in use, but which we were toldwas intended for scraping the scales off a fish. The specimen does notappear to be newly made. It is a piece of hollow “long” bone, 8 incheslong, cut into the shape of the blade of a case knife, flat on oneface with a broad, shallow, longitudinal groove on the other.  [Illustration: FIG. 313.--Fish scaler. 1/2]MAKING AND WORKING FIBER._Twisting and braiding._--We had no opportunity of seeing the processof twisting the sinew twine, which is sometimes used in place of thebraid so often mentioned but more generally when an extra strongthread is desired, as in sewing on boot soles. Fig. 314 (No. 89431[1332] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a little shuttle of walrus ivory, 3 incheslong and 1⅓ broad, which we were told was used in this process. Thebody of this shuttle is reduced to a narrow crosspiece, and the prongsat one end are twice as long as those at the other. The tips of thelong prongs are about ¼ inch apart, while those of the short onesnearly meet. There is a small round hole in one side of the body. Thisspecimen was made for sale. As well as I could understand the seller,the ends of several strands of fine sinew were fastened into the holein the shuttle and twisted by twisting it with one hand, while theother end was held perhaps by the other hand. The part twisted wasthen wound on the shuttle and a fresh length twisted. This would be avery simple form of spinning with a spindle.  [Illustration: FIG. 314.--Ivory shuttle. 1/2]No special implements for twisting have been described among otherEskimo. Mr. E. W. Nelson (in a letter to the writer) says that thenatives of Norton Sound informed him that the cable twisters(kaputa--kíbu´tûk at Norton Sound) were also used for making twistedcord. He describes their use as follows: “The ends of the sinew cordare tied to the center holes in the two ivory pieces, one of thelatter at each end of the cord, and then they are twisted in oppositedirections, thus getting the hard-laid sinew cord used on the bows.”  [Illustration: FIG. 315.--Netting needle. 1/3]The sinew twine used at Point Barrow is generally braided, almostalways in a three-ply braid, usually about the size of stoutpackthread, such as is found on many Eskimo implements from alllocalities represented in the Museum collections. That they also knowhow to braid with four strands is shown by the hair line alreadydescribed (No. 56545 [410]). They also have a special word (which Ican not recall) for braiding with four strands in distinction frombraiding with three (pidrá).  [Illustration: FIG. 316.--Mesh stick. 1/4]_Netting._--Two implements are used as usual in netting, a needle orlong flat shuttle for carrying the twine (Fig. 315, No. 56570 [101]),and a mesh stick for gauging the length of the mesh. The knot is theuniversal “fisherman’s knot” or becket hitch made in the usual manner.The method of using the mesh stick, however, is rather peculiar, andsomewhat clumsy compared with that used by civilized net-makers, as itserves only to measure the mesh and not also to hold the successivemeshes as they are made. It is a long flat piece of bone or antler,shaped like a case knife, with a blade square at heel and point. Thereis often also a little blunt hook (as in Fig. 316, No. 56581 [1021])at the point, bending upward or toward the back of the blade. Theblade is the part of the stick which measures the mesh, and its lengthfrom heel to point is always precisely half the length of the mesh tobe made. It is used as follows: The workman, holding the mesh stick bythe handle in his left hand, with the blade downward, catches the meshinto which the knot is to be made with the hook, and holds it whilethe twine is carried down the left side of the blade, round the heeland through the mesh as usual, and drawn up till the preceding knotcomes just to the point of the blade. This makes a loop of the properlength for a mesh round the stick. The point where the next knot is tobe made is now caught between the thumb and finger of the right handand the mesh stick taken out of the loop. The left thumb and finger,while the other fingers of this hand still hold the handle of thestick, relieve the fingers of the right hand, which goes on to makethe knot in the usual manner.[N418]    [Footnote N418: We had no special opportunities for watching the    natives at work netting, as but few nets happened to be made at    the village during our stay. It was, however, observed that the    mesh stick was taken out every time a knot was tied. Since my    return, after a careful study of the different mesh sticks in our    collection, I have convinced myself by experiment that the above    method of using the tool is the only one which will account for    the shape of the different parts.]We collected thirteen needles of different patterns and sizes. No.56570 [101], Fig. 315, has been selected as the type (ĭ´nmuvwĭñ,mû´kutĭn.) It is of walrus ivory, 11.9 inches long. The small holenear the tip of one prong is for a lanyard to hang it up by when notin use. This needle could be used only for making a large meshed net,perhaps a seal net.We collected seven needles of almost the same pattern as this, varyinga little in proportions. The faces are usually more deeply hollowedout and the ends usually sinuate instead of being straight. Three ofthese are of reindeer antler and the rest of ivory. The longest is 9.9inches long and the shortest 4½. This needle (No. 56574 [24], fromUtkiavwĭñ) is rather broad in proportion, being nearly 1 inch wide. Itis of walrus ivory. No. 89433 [942] is better suited for netting asmall mesh, being only 0.7 inch broad at the widest part. It is madeof reindeer antler and is 7.3 inches long. These needles sometimeshave a small hole through one end of the body for fastening the end ofthe twine, and most have some arrangement for fastening on a lanyard,either a hole as in the type or a groove round the tip of one prong asin No. 56574 [24].  [Illustration: FIG. 317.--Netting needles. 1/2]No. 89427 [1283], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a needle of a slightly differentpattern, being rather thick and not narrowed at the middle. It is ofreindeer antler, 8.7 inches long and 1 wide. No. 89430 [1286], Fig.317_a_, from Utkiavwĭñ, is a very broad needle, with short body andlong prongs, one of which is expanded at the tip and perforated for alanyard. It is a piece of the outside hard tissue of a reindeerantler, 5.4 inches long and 1.2 broad. It is but slightly narrowed atthe middle, while No. 89428 [1381], Fig. 317_b_, from Utkiavwĭñ,a somewhat similar broad needle of the same material is deeply notchedon each side of the body. This is made from antler of smaller diameterthan the preceding, and consequently is not flat, but strongly convex,on one face and correspondingly concave on the other. It is 8.2 incheslong and 1½ wide.  [Illustration: FIG. 318.--Netting needle for seal net. 1/6]For making the seal nets a very large needle is used. The one in thecollection, No. 56581 [102], Fig. 318, from Utkiavwĭñ, is 20½ incheslong and only 1½ wide. It is made of two nearly equal pieces ofantler, which are nearly flat, and lap over each other about 3¾ inchesnear the middle. They are strongly fastened together by five whalebonestitches, one at each corner of the splice and one in the middle. Thecorner stitches run round the edge of the two parts, and through ahole through both parts. The prongs are stout and curved, nearlymeeting at the tips. They are about 3 inches long. The lateraldistortion appears to be due to warping.  [Illustration: FIG. 319.--Netting needle. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 320.--Mesh sticks. 1/2]A peculiar netting needle is shown in Fig. 319 (No. 89429 [1333], fromUtkiavwĭñ), which is new and rather carelessly made from very coarsewalrus ivory. The tips of the prongs, after nearly meeting, divergeagain in the form of the letter U. This needle, which is 9½ incheslong, was said by the maker to be of the pattern used by the“Kûñmû´d’lĭñ.” There are no specimens resembling it in the museumcollections, though it curiously suggests certain implements fromNorton Sound, labeled “reels for holding fine cord,” consisting ofslender rods of antler, terminating at each end in similar shallowU-shaped forks.The mesh stick (kú´brĭn) belonging to the large netting needle, No.56581 [102], may be taken as the type of this implement. It is a pieceof the hard outside tissue of a reindeer antler. The three notches onthe lower edge of the haft are for the fingers. The incised line alongone face of the blade is probably a mark to which the twine is to bedrawn in making a mesh. The blade is just the proper length, 7½inches, for the large mesh of the seal net. The remaining four meshsticks are all small, and intended for making fish nets. Three are ofreindeer antler and the fourth of hard bone, with a wooden haft.Fig. 320_a_ (No. 89436 [1284], from Utkiavwĭñ) is of antler, 7.2inches long, with a blade of 2.7 inches, protected from splitting by astout round peg of hard bone, driven through the handle so as to lieagainst the heel of the blade. It terminates in a blunt point insteadof a hook, and has three finger notches in the haft. No. 89437 [942],also from Utkiavwĭñ, is of the same material, 5.2 inches long, withouta hook and with a blade only 1 inch long. There are two finger notchesin the haft. The last of the antler mesh sticks (No. 89439 [983], fromUtkiavwĭñ, Fig. 320_b_) is double ended, having a hook and a shortblade at each end. The blades are respectively 1.5 and 1.6 incheslong, and the total length is 6.6 inches. Fig. 320_c_ (No. 89435[1019], also from Utkiavwĭñ) has a blade, with a small hook, of whitecompact bone, and what would be the handle lashed to one side of ahaft of soft wood, which is shouldered to receive it. The haft is 4.3inches long, and the two parts are held together by two lashings offine sinew, kept from slipping by notches. The total length is 7.3inches, that of the blade 2.7. Netting needles and mesh sticks ofessentially the same type as those just described, but varying inmaterial and dimensions, are in general use from the Anderson River toBristol Bay, as is shown by the Museum collections._Netting weights._--We collected 16 little ivory implements, each,when complete, consisting of the image of a fish about 3½ to 4 incheslong, suspended by a string about 4 inches long to a little ivoryspring hook. We never happened to see these implements in use, but wewere told that they were used in netting to keep the meshes in propershape. They generally were made in pairs. The only way of using themthat I can think of is first to hook one into the bight of the firstmesh made in starting the net. This would make the successive meshes,as they were netted, hang down out of the way. On starting the nextrow in the opposite direction, the second weight hooked into the firstmesh of this row would draw the successive meshes down on theleft-hand side of the stick, while the other weight would keep themeshes of the first row stretched so that one could be easily caughtat a time. On beginning the third row the first weight would betransferred to the first mesh of this, and so on. Fig. 321_a_ is oneof a pair of these nĕpĭtaúra (No. 56596 [207]) which has been selectedas the type. It is a rather rude figure of a salmon or trout 4 incheslong, neatly carved out of walrus ivory. The string is of braidedsinew and the hook of walrus ivory.  [Illustration: FIG. 321.--Netting weights.]Fig. 321_b_ (No. 89442 [899] from Nuwŭk) is a weight without the hookand made of compact whale’s bone. It is 4.1 inches long, and veryneatly carved, having all the fins in relief, the gill openings,mouth, and eyes incised. No. 56582 [173] from Utkiavwĭñ is one of apair very rudely carved out of a piece of snow-shovel edge. The mouthand gill openings are indicated by incised and blackened lines, thelatter fringed with short lines, each ending in a dot, perhaps torepresent the gill filaments. It is 4.2 inches long, and hastily madefor sale. Fig. 321_c_ (No. 56578 [201] from Utkiavwĭñ) seems to beintended for a polar cod, and has the hole drilled through the root ofthe tail. The lateral line is marked by a scratch, colored with blacklead, and the dark color of the back is represented by curved,transverse scratches also colored with black lead. When the carving issufficiently good to show what sort of a fish is meant, it isgenerally a salmon or trout. Only 3 out of the 16 are of anything butwalrus ivory. These 3 are of compact whale’s bone, and one had smallblue glass beads inlaid for eyes, of which one still remains. Theshortest is 3.4 inches long, and the longest 4.3, but most of them arealmost exactly 4 inches long.  [Illustration: FIG. 322.--Shuttle belonging to set of feather tools.  1/2]_Weaving._--A set of little tools made of bone and reindeer antlerwere brought over for sale, which were said to be those used inweaving the feather belts. I had no opportunity of seeing a belt made,but the work evidently does not require all three of these tools. Thelittle netting needle or shuttle of bone (Fig. 322, No. 89434 [1338])can not be used in feather weaving, because, as already mentioned, thestrips of feather are not fastened together into a continuous cordwhich could be carried on a shuttle. It is 5.9 inches long and 0.7wide. There is also a little mesh stick of antler (Fig. 323, No. 89438[1338]) 6.7 inches long, with a blade 1.9 inches in length, and alittle hook, which appears to be fitted for nothing except netting asmall net. The lower edge of the handle, however, is cut into 10 deeprounded notches, which perhaps serve the purpose of a rude “frame” forkeeping apart the strands of the warp, while the woof of feather ispassed through with the fingers. It would be held with this edge up,and the beginning of the belt being fastened to the wall, the warpstrands would be stretched over this, as over a violin bridge, eachresting in one of the notches. The last tool of the set (Fig. 324, No.89462 [1338]) is undoubtedly a “sword” for pushing home the woof, andprobably also serves to separate the strands of the warp into a“shed.” It is a flat, thin piece of antler, 9 inches long andthree-fourths wide, of which about 6½ inches forms a straight blade 6½inches long, and the rest is bent round to one side and slightly down,forming a handle. When the strands of the warp are stretched over thebridge as above described, pushing this horizontally through themalternately over and under the successive strands, would make a “shed”through which the end of the woof could be thrust with one motion, andpushed up against the preceding strand of the woof by sliding thesword forward. It would then be withdrawn and passed through again,going over the strands it went under before and vice versa, so as toopen a “shed” for the next strand of the woof.  [Illustration: FIG. 323.--Mesh stick. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 324.--“Sword” for feather weaving. 1/2]_Sewing._--For sewing furs and leather they always use thread made bystripping off thin fibers from a piece of dried sinew of the reindeer,as is usual with Eskimo. Cotton or linen thread of civilizedmanufacture is now often used for sewing the cotton frocks, etc., andsometimes for making an ornamental seam on the waterproof gut shirts.The stitches employed have already been described under the head ofclothing (which see). They hold the needle between the thumb andmiddle finger, with the thimble on the forefinger (both are called bythe same name, tĭ´kyǝ) and sew toward them. This appears to be theregular Eskimo method of sewing.[N419]    [Footnote N419: See Parry, Second Voy., p. 537; Lyon, Journal,    p. 93; Kumlien, Contributions, p. 25.]At the present day they are well supplied with steel needles (miksun)of all sizes and patterns, but formerly they used bone needles madefrom the fibula (amĭlyĕrûñ) of the reindeer. We collected sixty ofthese needles, eighteen of which appear to be old and genuine. Therest were more or less carefully made for sale. Nĭkawáalu told us thatonce when he and a young man were out deer hunting a long distancefrom camp their boots gave out. Having killed a deer he made threadfrom the sinew, a needle from the bone, and with pieces of the skinrepaired their boots, so that they got home in comfort.  [Illustration: FIG. 325.--Quill case of bone needles.]No. 89389 [1191], Fig. 325 will serve as the type of these needles.This is a case 3½ inches long, made of the butt of a large quill,closed with a plug of walrus hide, and contains 6 needles. One is 1.8inches long, stout, and round-pointed, with a large eye. It is muchdiscolored from age. The second is also round-pointed but moreslender, 1.9 inches long, and flattened and expanded at the butt. Thethird is 2.4 inches long, and has a four-sided point like a glover’sneedle. All three of these are very neatly made and appear old. Theother three are stout, roughly made, and flat, respectively 2.1, 2.2,and 2.5 inches long. Two of them look suspiciously new. This set wassaid to have been the property of the wife of Puka, Nĭkawáalu’sfather.  [Illustration: FIG. 326.--Needles and thimbles: (_a_) large bone  needle and peculiar thimble; (_b_) leather thimbles with bone  needles. 3/4]Fig. 326_a_ is a peculiarly large and flat needle (No. 89392 [1195]from Utkiavwĭñ) 3.2 inches long, with a round, sharp point and a largeeye, with little grooves running to the butt on each side for thethread to lie in. This needle was perhaps specially meant for sewingboat skins. With this needle belongs a peculiar large bone or ivorythimble. The remaining needles are all very much alike, though someare more roughly made than the others. Three of them have the buttsquare instead of rounded, and half of them, including some which areundoubtedly old, are four-sided at the point like a glover’s needle.The longest is 3 inches long and the shortest 1.4 inches, but thecommonest length is about 2 or 2½ inches. Similar bone needles arementioned by various authors.[N420]    [Footnote N420: Formerly they used the bones of fishes or the very    fine bones of birds instead of needles. Crantz, vol. 1, p. 136.    “Their own clumsy needles of bone,” Parry, Second Voy., p. 537 and    pl. opposite p. 548, Fig. 11. Kumlien also speaks of “steel    needles or bone ones made after the same pattern” at Cumberland    Gulf (Contributions, p. 25).]Nearly all the women now use ordinary metal thimbles, obtained intrade, but they wear them in the old-fashioned way, on the tip of theforefinger. Some of the older women, however, still prefer the ancientleather thimble. There are two patterns of these: one intended for thefore-finger only, and the other of such a shape that it may also beworn on the other fingers as a guard against chafing in pulling stoutthread through thick leather. It is often so used at the present day.We collected three of the first-mentioned pattern, which isrepresented by Fig. 326_b_ (No. 89396 [1202,1246]). It is made bycutting out a narrow ring of raw sealskin 0.7 inch in diameter, with acircular flap 0.5 inch in diameter on the outside of the ring and acorresponding one on the inside of the same size, cut out of themiddle of the ring. The flaps are doubled over so as to make a pad onthe inside of the forefinger when the tip of the latter is insertedinto the ring. The butt of the needle presses against this pad.The third thimble, which belongs with the needlecase (No. 89371[1276]), is of precisely the same form and dimensions.There appeared to be little if any variation among those which we saw.Capt. Lyon[N421] figures two similar thimbles from Iglulik, which aredescribed on page 537 of the same work as being made of leather. Theflaps, however, seem to be only semicircular and not folded over, sothat the shield consists of only one thickness of leather.    [Footnote N421: Parry, Second Voy., pl. opposite p. 550, Fig. 25.]A similar thimble with the flap also not folded is used at CumberlandGulf.[N422]    [Footnote N422: Boas, Central Eskimo, p. 524, Fig. 473 and    Kumlien, Contributions, p. 25.]The other pattern, of which we brought home nine specimens, isrepresented by No. 89389 [1191], which belongs with the set of boneneedles of the same number. It is a tube, open at both ends, one ofwhich is larger than the other, made by bending round a strip of splitwalrus hide and sewing the ends together. It is 0.4 inch long and 2.1in circumference at the larger end. It is worn smooth with handling,and impregnated with grease and dirt and marked with small pits whereit has been pressed against the butt of the needle in use.Four other old thimbles (No. 89393 [1194], from Utkiavwĭñ, are made inthe same way, but are a trifle larger. As they show no needle-marks,they were probably used only as finger guards. The remaining four aresimilar to the above, but newly made, for sale.A most peculiar thimble, the only one of the kind seen, is shown inFig. 326_a_ (No. 89392 [1195] from Utkiavwĭñ, belonging with the largebone needle of the same number already described and figured). This ismade of a single piece of walrus ivory, browned with age, and theround shallow socket is for the butt of the needle. The ends of thehalf ring are slightly expanded and notched on the outside to receivea string to complete the ring so that it can be fitted round thefinger, with the flange in the same position as the pad of a leatherthimble.Needles are kept in a case (ujyami), consisting of a tube of bone orivory about 5 or 6 inches long, through which is drawn a broad strapof leather furnished with a knot at one end to keep it from slippingwholly through. Into one side of this strap the needles are thrustobliquely, so that when the strap is pulled in they are covered by thetube. To the other end of the strap is usually attached an ivory snaphook for fastening the needle case to the girdle of the pantaloons.These needle cases are made of two slightly different patterns, ofwhich the first is represented by No. 89365 [1277], Fig. 327_a_. It isof white walrus ivory, 4½ inches long, and the strap is of seal thongabout 11 inches long and 0.3 inch wide. At one end of this is apear-shaped knob of walrus ivory, which is shouldered off at the smallend and worked into a short flattened shank perforated with a largeeye, through which the end of the strap, which is cut narrow, isthrust. It is fastened by doubling it back and sewing it to thestanding part. A sky-blue transparent glass bead is inlaid in thelarge end of the knob. The other end of the strap is fastened in thesame way into a tranverse slot in the end of the belt hook(tĭ´tkĭbwĭñ) of ivory, 4.7 inches long.  [Illustration: FIG. 327.--Needle cases with belt hooks. 1/3]This pattern appears to be usually made of walrus ivory. Only one ofthe six brought home is of bone, and this is an unusually small one,only 3.6 inches long, made for sale. The usual length is 4½ to 5inches. No. 89363 [1105], Fig. 327_b_, from Utkiavwĭñ, is a tube verymuch like the one described, but is ornamented with an incised patterncolored with red ocher, and has a differently shaped belt hook. Whenthe latter is hooked over the girdle the ring is pushed up the shankover the point of the hook till it fits tight, and thus keeps the hookfrom slipping off the belt.Fig. 328_a_ (No. 89364 [1243] from Utkiavwĭñ) is another ivory needlecase, 4.7 inches long. The tube was once ornamented with incisedpatterns, but these are almost wholly worn off by constant handling.The knob is carved into an ornamental shape, having a circle of sixround knobs round the middle. It has been suggested that this is meantto represent a cloud-berry (Rubus chamæmorus), a fruit known to the“Nunatañmiun” though not at Point Barrow. The hook is a snap hook verymuch like those described in connection with the netting weights, butlarger (3 inches long) and very broad at the upper end, which is madeinto a broad ring. The point of a steel needle still sticking in theflesh side of the strap shows how the needles are carried with thepoints toward the knob.  [Illustration: FIG. 328.--Needle cases: (_a_) case with belt hook;  (_b_) case open, showing bone needles. 1/2]No. 89370 [1033], also from Utkiavwĭñ, has no knob, but the end of thestrap is kept from slipping through by rolling it up transversely andcatching it with a stitch of sinew. It has a broad flat snap hooksimilar to the last, but cut on the edges into ornamental scallops.The tube is ornamented with an incised pattern colored red with ocher,and is 5.2 long. No. 56575 [7] is an old tube of brown walrus ivory,enlarged into a knob at one end. It has no knob or hook, but a newstrap of white seal skin, in the lower end of which is tied a largeknot. The other pattern has the cylinder made of a hollow “long” bone,in its natural shape. This bone appears to be almost always thehumerus of some large bird, probably a swan. The strap has usually noknob, but is kept from slipping through by knotting the end or tyingon a large bead or a bear’s toe, or some such object too large to gothrough the tube. None of these have belt hooks except one new androughly made specimen.These bone tubes are apparently older than the neat ivory cylinders,and it is not unlikely that the belt hook was not invented till theformer was mostly out of fashion. No. 89361 [1239], Fig. 328_b_ fromUtkiavwĭñ, is one of these which has for knob one of the large darkblue glass beads which used to bring such enormous prices in the earlydays of Arctic trading, and which are still the kind most highlyprized. The end of the strap is cut narrow, passed through the bead,and knotted on the end. This case carries a half-dozen of theold-fashioned bone needles, which appear to be genuine. It is 3.7inches long and, roughly speaking, 0.4 in diameter. No. 89369 [1201],also from Utkiavwĭñ, resembles the above, but has a wolverine’s toesewed to the end of the strap. No. 89371 [1276], from Utkiavwĭñ, alsohas the toe of a wolverine for a knob, and has a belt hook with twotongues made of reindeer antler. No. 89366 [1137], from Utkiavwĭñ, isa highly ornamented case of this pattern, which has a shortcylindrical knob, also ornamented. No. 89368 [1089], from Utkiavwĭñ,is not made of bird’s bone, but is a piece of a long bone from somemammal, and has a brown bear’s toe for a knob. No. 89367 [1339], fromthe same village, is roughly made of a branch of antler, 3.9 incheslong and 0.8 wide, hollowed out. It has a knob of whale’s bone, but nobelt hook, the end of the strap being knotted into a leather thimbleof the first pattern. Of the six specimens of this pattern in thecollection only the first is a genuine old implement. All the othersare merely commercial imitations rather carelessly made.This kind of needle case is very commonly used throughout Alaska, asis shown by the enormous collections in the National Museum broughthome by various explorers, Nelson, Turner, Dall and others. The needlecase from Iglulik, figured by Capt. Lyon,[N423] resembles the secondor older pattern, being of bone, not tapered at the ends, and havingneither knob nor belt hook. To the ends of the strap are hung thimbles“and other small articles liable to be lost.”[N424] Dr. Simpson[N425]speaks of the needle case in use at Point Barrow, but merely describesit as “a narrow strip of skin in which the needles are stuck, with atube of bone, ivory, or iron to slide down over them, and kept fromslipping off the lower end by a knob or large bead.” This appears torefer only to the second or older pattern.    [Footnote N423: Parry’s Second Voyage, pl. opposite p. 550, Fig.    25.]    [Footnote N424: Ibid., p. 537.]    [Footnote N425: Op. cit, p. 245.]The old-fashioned ring thimbles were usually carried on the belt hookof the needlecase, but modern thimbles require a box. These boxes(kigiunɐ), which are usually small and cylindrical, also serve forholding thread, beads, and all sorts of little trinkets orknickknacks, and many of them are so old that they were evidently usedfor this purpose long before the introduction of metal thimbles.Little tin canisters, spice boxes, etc., are also used for the samepurpose nowadays. We brought home thirteen of these boxes, of whichNo. 89407 [1158] Fig. 329_a_ has been chosen as the type. It is apiece of the beam of a stout antler, 4.3 inches long, cut off squareon the ends and hollowed out. Into the large end is fitted a flatbottom of thin pine, fastened in by four little treenails of wood. Thecover is of the same material. It is held on by a string of sinewbraid about 11 inches long, which passes out through the lower of thetwo little holes on one side of the box, being held by a knot at theend, in through the upper, then out and in through two similar holesin the middle of the cover, and out through a hole on the other sideof the box. Pulling the end of this string draws the cover down snuglyinto its place.Some of the remaining boxes are made of antler, and vary in lengthfrom 4.7 to 8 inches. The last is, however, unusually large, most ofthe others being about 5 inches long. The covers are generally held onby strings much in the manner described, and the ends are both usuallyof wood, though two old boxes have both ends made of antler, and onehas a top of hard bone. The last is a specimen newly made for sale.These boxes are sometimes ornamented on the outside with incisedlines, colored red or blackened, either conventional patterns as inFig. 329_b_ (No. 89405 [1335], from Utkiavwĭñ) or figures of men andanimals as in Fig. 329_c_ (No. 56615 [41] from the same village). Theformer is a new box, 4.7 inches long, and has the wooden ends bothshouldered to fit tightly. The cover is worked with a string.  [Illustration: FIG. 329.--Trinket boxes. 1/2]No. 56615 [41] on the other hand is very old, and has lost its cover.The wooden bottom is shouldered and held in with treenails. Thesurface is elaborately ornamented with incised and blackened figures.It is divided by longitudinal lines into four nearly equal panels, onwhich the figures are disposed as follows (the animals all beingrepresented as standing on the longitudinal lines, and facing towardthe right, that is, toward the open end of the box): On the firstpanel are 4 reindeer, alternately a buck and a doe, followed by a manin a kaiak, and over his head two small “circles and dots,” one abovethe other. All the deer on this box are represented strictly inprofile, so as to show only two legs and one antler each. On thesecond panel are 4 deer, all does, followed by a man with a bow slungacross his back. On the third, a man in the middle appears to becalling 2 dogs, who, at the left of the panel, are drawing a railedsled. Reversed, and on the upper border of the panel, is a man pushingbehind a similar sled drawn by 3 dogs. The head dog has stopped and issitting down on his haunches. The dogs, like the reindeer, are allstrictly in profile and rather conventionalized. In the fourth panelare 3 reindeer followed by a man in his kaiak, and upside down, above,a deer without legs, supposed to be swimming in the water, and a veryrude figure of a man in his kaiak. These figures probably representactual occurrences, forming a sort of record.  [Illustration: FIG. 330.--Trinket boxes. 1/2]Fig. 330_a_ (No. 89408 [1371] from Sidaru) is a piece of stout antler,4.7 inches long, which has the bottom of pine fitted tightly inwithout fastenings. The cover is of wood, covered, to make it fittight, with parchment, apparently shrunk on and puckered on the uppersurface. A thick hank of untwisted sinew is fastened as a handlethrough the middle of the cover. This box is old and dirty, andcontains an unfinished flint arrow-head. No. 56505 [59] fromUtkiavwĭñ, is a new box, closed at the ends with thick shoulderedplugs of pine wood. The tube is 8 inches long and ornamented with aconventional pattern of incised lines colored with red ocher.Fig. 330_b_ (No. 89402 [1359] also from Utkiavwĭñ), is peculiar fromthe material of which it is made. It is of about the same pattern asthe common antler boxes, but is made of the butt end of the _os penis_of a large walrus, cut off square and hollowed out, and has ends ofhard whale’s bone. Its length is 4.2 inches. No. 89403 [1425] Fig. 331from Sidaru, is made of the hollow butt of a good-sized walrus tusk,3.2 inches long. It has a neatly fitted wooden bottom, held in with 6treenails, two of ivory and four of wood. The box has been cracked andsplit and mended with stitches of sinew and whalebone. Peculiarconventional patterns are incised on the box and cover. A peculiar boxis shown in Fig. 332 (No. 56583 [37] from Utkiavwĭñ). This is ofcompact white bone, with a flat wooden bottom. I do not recollectseeing any other boxes of the same sort.  [Illustration: FIG. 331.--Ivory box. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 332.--Bone box. 1/2]Fig. 333 (No. 89409 [1372]) is the tip of a walrus tusk cut off andhollowed out into a sort of flask, 3.8 inches long, closed at thelarge end by a flat wooden bottom, fastened in with treenails and atthe small end by a stopper of soft wood.  [Illustration: FIG. 333.--Little flask of ivory. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 334.--Box in shape of deer. 1/2]The most peculiar box of all, however, is shown in Fig. 334 (No. 56512[2] from Utkiavwĭñ), the only specimen of the kind seen. It is 5.5inches long, made of reindeer antler, and very neatly carved into amost excellent image of a reindeer lying on its left side, with thehead, which has no antlers, turned down and to the left. The legs arefolded up against the belly, the forelegs with the hoofs pointingbackward, the hind hoofs pointing forward. The eyes are represented bysmall sky-blue glass beads, and the mouth, nostrils, and navel neatlyincised, the last being particularly well-marked. The tips of thehoofs are rounded off, which, taken in connection with the attitudeand the well marked navel, lead me to believe that the image is meantto represent an unborn fetus. The whole of the body is hollowed, theaperture taking up the whole of the buttocks, and closed by a flat,thick plug of soft wood. A round peg of wood is driven in to close anaccidental hole just above the left shoulder. The box is old anddiscolored, and worn smooth with much handling.  [Illustration: FIG. 335.--Small basket. 1/2]Rarely these little workboxes are made of basketwork. We obtained fourspecimens of these small baskets, of which No. 56564 [88] Fig. 335,workbasket (águma, áma, ipiáru), will serve as the type. The neck isof black tanned sealskin, 2½ inches long, and has 1 vertical seam, tothe middle of which is sewed the middle of a piece of fine seal thong,a foot long, which serves to tie up the mouth. The basket appears tobe made of fine twigs or roots of the willow, with the bark removed,and is made by winding an osier spirally into the shape of the basket,and wrapping a narrow splint spirally around the two adjacent parts ofthis, each turn of the splint being separated from the next by a turnof the succeeding tier. The other basket from Utkiavwĭñ (No. 56565[135]) is almost exactly like this, but larger (3.5 inches in diameterand 2.2 high), and has holes round the top of the neck for thedrawstring.  [Illustration: FIG. 336.--Small basket. 1/3]Two baskets from Sidaru are of the same material and workmanship, butsomewhat larger and of a different shape, as shown in Fig. 336, No.89801 [1366], and Fig. 337, No. 89802 [1427]. This was the onlyspecies of basketwork seen among these people and is probably not ofnative manufacture.Prof. O. T. Mason, of the National Museum, has called my attention tothe fact that the method of weaving employed in making these basketsis the same as that used by the Apaches and Navajos, who have beenshown to be linguistically of the same stock as the Athabascan orTinné group of Indians of the North. The first basket collected, No.56564 [88], was said by the owner to have come from the “great river”in the south. Now, the name Kuwûk or Kowak, applied to the westernstream flowing into Hotham Inlet, means simply “great river,” and thisis the region where the Eskimo come into very intimate commercialrelations with Indians of Tinné stock.[N426] Therefore, inconsideration of the Indian workmanship of these baskets, and thestatement that one of them came from the “great river, south,” I amwell convinced that they were made by the Indians of the regionbetween the Koyukuk and Silawĭk Rivers, and sold by them to theKuwûñmiun, whence they could easily find their way to Point Barrowthrough the hands of the “Nunatañmiun” traders.    [Footnote N426: Dall, American Association, Address, 1885, p. 13.]  [Illustration: FIG. 337.--Small basket. 1/3]The Eskimo of Alaska south of Bering Strait make and use baskets ofmany patterns, but east of Point Barrow baskets are exceedingly rare.The only mention of anything of the kind will be found in Lyon’sJournal.[N427] He mentions seeing at Iglulik a “small round basketcomposed of grass in precisely the same manner as those constructed bythe Tibboo, in the southern part of Fezzan, and agreeing with themalso in its shape.” Now, these Africans make baskets of precisely thesame “coiled” work (as Prof. Mason calls it) as the Tinné, so that inall probability what Lyon saw was one of these same baskets, carriedeast in trade, like other western objects already referred to. Thename áma applied to these baskets at Point Barrow (the other two namesappear to be simply “bag” or receptacle) corresponds to theGreenlandic amåt, the long thin runners from the root of a tree, “atpresent used in the plural also for a basket of European basketwork,”(because they had no idea that twigs could be so small)--GrønlandskeOrdbog.    [Footnote N427: P. 172.]No. 89799 [1329] from Utkiavwĭñ, is a peculiar bag, the only one ofthe kind seen, used for the same purpose as the boxes and baskets justdescribed. It is the stomach of a polar bear, with the muscular andglandular layers removed, dried and carefully worked down with a skinscraper into something like goldbeater’s skin. This makes a large,nearly spherical bag 7½ inches in diameter, of a pale brownish color,soft and wrinkled, with a mouth 6 inches wide. A small hole has beenmended by drawing the skin together and winding it round tightly onthe inside with sinew.MEANS OF LOCOMOTION AND TRANSPORTATION.TRAVELING BY WATER._Kaiaks and paddles._--Like all the rest of the Eskimo race, thenatives of Point Barrow use the kaiak, or narrow, light, skin-coveredcanoe, completely decked over except at the middle, where there is ahole or cockpit in which the man sits. Although nearly every maleabove the age of boyhood owns and can manage one of these canoes, theyare much less generally employed than by any other Eskimo whose habitshave been described, except the “Arctic highlanders,” who have noboats, and perhaps those of Siberia and their Chuckche companions. Thekaiak is used only during the season of open water, and then butlittle in the sea in the neighborhood of the villages. Those whoremain near the villages in the summer use the kaiak chiefly formaking the short excursions to the lakes and streams inland, alreadydescribed, after reindeer, and for making short trips from camp tocamp along the coast. At Pernyû they are used in setting thestake-nets and also for retrieving fowl which have fallen in the waterwhen shot.According to Dr. Simpson[N428] the men of the parties which go east inthe summer travel in their kaiaks after reaching the open water “tomake room in the large boat for the oil-skins.” We obtained noinformation regarding this. It is at this time, probably, that thekaiak comes specially in play for spearing molting fowl and“flappers”, and for catching seals with the kúkiga. They manage thekaiak with great skill and confidence, but we never knew them to goout in rough weather, nor did we ever see the practice, so frequentlydescribed elsewhere, of tying the skirts of the waterproof jacketround the coaming of the cockpit so as to exclude the water.    [Footnote N428: Op. cit. p. 264.]It should, however, be borne in mind that from the reasons abovestated our opportunities for observing the use of the kaiak were verylimited. At all events it is certain that the people depend mainly onthe umiak, not only for traveling, but for hunting and fishing aswell, which places them in strong contrast with the Greenlanders, whoare essentially a race of kaiakers and have consequently developed theboat and its appendages to a high state of perfection.We brought home one complete full-sized kaiak, with its paddle, No.57773 [539], Fig. 338_a_ and _b_, which is a very fair representativeof the canoes used at Point Barrow. This is 19 feet long and 18 incheswide amidships. The gunwales are straight, except for a very slightsheer at the bow, and the cockpit is 21 inches long and 18½ incheswide. It has a frame of wood, which appears to be all of spruce, heldtogether by treenails and whalebone lashings, and is covered withwhite-tanned sealskins with the grain side out. The stoutest part ofthe frame is the two gunwales, each 3¼ inches broad and ½-inch thick,flat, and rounded off on the upper edge inside, running the wholelength of the boat and meeting at the stem and stern, graduallytapered up on the lower edge at each end. The ribs, of which there areat least forty-three, are bent into nearly a half-circle, thus makinga U-shaped midship section, and are ¾-inch wide by ⅓-inch thick, flaton the outer side and round on the inner. Their ends are mortised intothe lower edge of the gunwale and fastened with wooden treenails. Theyare set in about 3 inches apart and decrease gradually in size foreand aft. Outside of these are seven equidistant streaks running foreand aft, ¾ inch to 1 inch wide and ¼ inch thick, of which the upper oneach side reaches neither stem nor stern. These are lashed to the ribswith a strip of whalebone, which makes a round turn about one rib,above the streak, going under the rib first, and a similar turn roundthe next rib below the streak (Fig. 339).  [Illustration: FIG. 338.--Kaiak.]There is a stout keelson, hemi-elliptical in section, under thecockpit only. This is 4½ feet long, about 2 inches deep, and 1½ incheswide, and is fastened in the middle and about 1 foot from each end bya strip of whalebone, which passes through a transverse hole in thekeelson, round the rib on one side, back through the keelson, andround the rib on the other side twice. The end is wrapped spirallyround the turns on one side and tucked into the hole in the keelson.The deck beams are not quite so stout as the ribs and are mortisedinto the upper edge of the gunwales a little below the level of thedeck. The ends are secured by lashings or stitches of some materialwhich are concealed by the skin cover. They are about as far apart asthe ribs, but neither exactly correspond nor break joints with thelatter.  [Illustration: FIG. 339.--Method of fastening together frame of  kaiak.]At the after end of the cockpit is an extra stout beam or thwart tosupport the back, 1¾ inches wide and three-quarters inch thick, withrounded edges, the ends of which are apparently lashed with thong. Thefirst beam forward of the cockpit is rounded, and appears to be anatural crook forming a #U#-shaped arch, and is followed by seven#V#-shaped knees, thickest in the middle and enlarged a little at theends, successively decreasing in height to the seventh, which isalmost straight. This makes the rise in the deck forward of thecockpit.Every alternate deck beam is braced to the gunwale at each end by anoblique lashing of whalebone, running from a transverse hole in thebeam about 1 inch from the gunwale to a corresponding hole in thegunwale, three-quarters inch from the lower edge. The lashing makesthree or four turns through these holes and around the lower edge ofthe gunwale, and the end is wrapped spirally round these turns fortheir whole length. Above these beams a narrow batten runs fore andaft amidships from cockpit to stem and stern, mortised into the twobeams at the cockpit, and lashed to the others with whalebone. Thecoaming of the cockpit is made of a single flat piece of wood, 1¾inches broad and one-quarter inch thick, bent into a hoop with theends lapping about 6 inches and “sewed” together with stitches ofwhalebone. Round the upper edge of this, on the outside, is fitted a“half-round” hoop, which appears to be made of willow, three-quartersby one-third inch, with its ends lapped about 4 inches, this lapcoming over the joint of the larger hoop. It is fastened on by shortstitches of whalebone about 5 or 6 inches apart, leaving room enoughbetween the two hoops to allow a lacing of fine whalebone to passthrough. The coaming is put on over the edge of the skin cover, whichis drawn up tight inside of the coaming and over its upper edge andfastened by a lacing of whalebone, which runs spirally round the outerhoop and through holes about one-half inch apart in the edge of thecover.  [Illustration: FIG. 340.--Double kayak paddle. 1/12]The coaming fits over the crown of the arch of the forward deck beamand rests on the middle of the thwart aft, and is secured by lashingsof whalebone, which pass through holes in the coaming and over itsupper edge. The forward lashing makes three turns, which pass roundthe beam with the end wrapped spirally round the parts between beamand coaming; the after lashing, four similar turns, which pass througha hole in the thwart and around its forward edge. On each side is astout vertical brace of wood 3¼ inches long, 1 inch wide, and one-halfinch thick, with rounded edges and corners. The ends are cut outparallel to the breadth, so that one end fits on to the upper edge ofthe gunwale, while the other receives the lower edge of the coaming,protruding on the outside through a hole in the cover.The cover is of six sealskins, put together heads to tails, so thatthere is only one longitudinal seam, which runs irregularly along thedeck. The transverse seams, which run obliquely across the bottom aredouble and sewed with a blind stitch, like the seams already describedon the waterproof boots, from the inside. These seams are nearly 2inches wide. The longitudinal seam is sewed in the same way from theoutside, but not so broadly lapped, with the edge turned over into aroll. There are two pieces of stout thong stretched across the deck,one forward of the cockpit and the other aft, which serve to fastenarticles to the deck. The thong passes out through a hole in thegunwale, one-half inch from the upper edge and 6 inches from thecockpit, on the starboard side forward and on the port side aft, andis secured by a knot in the end inboard. The other end passes inthrough a corresponding hole in the other gunwale and is looselyknotted to the deck beams, so that the line can be slackened off ortautened up at pleasure. Three feet from the bow is a becket forholding spears, etc., fastened into two little holes bored diagonallyoutward through the edge of the gunwales. It is of two parts of sealthong, one part twisted round the other, but is broken in the middle,so that only one-half of it is left. The weight of this kaiak in itspresent dry condition is 32 pounds.This is about the ordinary pattern of kaiak used at Point Barrow, andis a medium-sized one. These boats are made to fit the size of theowner, a youth or small man using a much smaller and lighter kaiakthan a heavy adult. They are never made to carry more than one person,and I have never heard of their being used by the women. In carryingthe kaiak across the land from lake to lake, it is held horizontallyagainst the side with the bow pointing forward, by thrusting theforearm into the cockpit. We never saw them carried on the head, inthe manner practised at Fury and Hecla Straits.[N429]    [Footnote N429: Lyon, Journal, p. 233. See also Capt. Lyon’s    figure in Parry’s 2d Voy., pl. opposite p. 274.]In entering the canoe the man takes great care to wipe his feet cleanof sand and gravel, which would work down under the timbers and chafethe skin. The canoe is launched in shoal water, preferably alongsideof a little bank, and the man steadies it by sticking down his paddleon the outer side and holding it with his left hand, while he balanceshimself on his right foot, and with his free hand carefully wipes hisleft foot. He then steps with his left foot into the kaiak, and stillbalancing himself with the help of the paddle, lifts and wipes hisright foot before he steps in with that. He then pushes his feet andlegs forward under the raised deck, settles himself in a properposition for trimming the boat, and shoves off. As elsewhere, thekaiak is always propelled with a paddle.No. 89246 [539], Fig. 340, is the paddle which belongs to the kaiakjust described. It is 7 feet long. The shaft joining the blades iselliptical in section, with its greatest width at right angles to theplane of the blades so to present the greatest resistance to thestrain of paddling. The shape of the blade, with rounded tip and thinrounded edges is admirably adapted to give the blade a clean entryinto the water. The whole is very neatly and smoothly made, and theblades are painted with red ocher. This is a much more effectivepaddle than those used by the Greenlanders and other eastern Eskimo,the blades of which, probably from the scarcity of wood[N430] are verynarrow, not exceeding 4 inches in width. In Greenland and Labrador,also, the blades are square at the ends like those of ordinary oars,and are usually edged with bone to prevent them from splitting. Theabsence of this bone edging on the paddles from Point Barrow perhapsindicates that they are meant for summer use only and not for workingamong the ice. In accordance with the general custom in northwesternAmerica, the double-bladed paddle (páutĭñ) is used only when greatspeed is desired, as in chasing game. It is handled in the usual way,being grasped with both hands near the middle, and dipped alternatelyon opposite sides. For ordinary traveling they use a single-bladedpaddle (áñun), of the same shape as those used in the umiak butusually somewhat smaller, of which we neglected to procure a specimen.With this they make a few strokes on one side, till the boat begins tosheer, then shift it over and make a few strokes, on the other side.They do this with very great skill, getting considerable speed, andmaking a remarkably straight wake. The use of this single paddleappears to be universal along the coast of Alaska, from Point Barrowsouthward, and it is also used at the Mackenzie and Anderson rivers,as shown by the models collected by MacFarlane in that region. It is,however, unknown among the eastern Eskimo about whom we have anydefinite information on the subject, namely, the Greenlanders, thepeople of Baffin Land, Hudson Strait, and Labrador.[N431]    [Footnote N430: It is a curious fact, however, that the narrowest    kaiak paddles I have ever seen belonged to some Eskimo that I saw    in 1876, at Rigolette, Labrador, who lived in a region    sufficiently well wooded to furnish them with lumber for a small    schooner, which they had built.]    [Footnote N431: For information concerning the last two regions I    am indebted to Mr. L. M. Turner; for the others to the standard    authorities.]Curiously enough the Greenlanders had a superstition of a sort ofmalevolent spirits called kajariak, who were “kayakmen of anextraordinary size, who always seem to be met with at a distance fromland beyond the usual hunting grounds. They were skilled in the artsof sorcery, particularly in the way of raising storms and bringing badweather. Like the umiarissat [other fabulous beings], _they useone-bladed paddles_, like those of the Indians.”[N432] This traditioneither refers back to a time when the ancestors of the Greenlandersused the single paddle or to occasional and perhaps hostile meetingsbetween eastern and western Eskimo.    [Footnote N432: Rink, Tales and Traditions, p. 47. See also p. 374    for a story of the meeting of a Greenlander with one of these    beings.]Though the kaiak is essentially the same wherever used, it differsconsiderably in size and external appearance in different localties.The kaiak of the Greenlanders is perhaps the best-known model, as ithas been figured and described by many authors. It is quite as lightand sharp as the Point Barrow model, but has a flat floor, the bilgebeing angular instead of rounded, and it has considerably more sheerto the deck, the stem and stern being prolonged into long curvedpoints, which project above the water, and are often shod with bone orivory. The coaming of the cockpit also is level, or only slightlyraised forward. The kaiaks used in Baffin Land, Hudson Straits, andLabrador are of a very similar model, but larger and heavier, havingthe projecting points at the bow and stern rather shorter and lesssharp, and the coaming of the cockpit somewhat more raised forward.Both of these forms are represented by specimens and numerous modelsin the museum collections. I have seen one flat-floored kaiak at PointBarrow. It belonged to a youth and was very narrow and light.The kaiak in use at Fury and Hecla Straits, as described by Capt.Lyon[N433] and Capt. Parry[N434] is of a somewhat different model,approaching that used at the Anderson River. It is a large kaiak 25feet long, with the bow and stern sharp and considerably more bent upthan in the Greenland kaiaks, but round-bottomed, like the westernkaiaks. The deck is flat, with the cockpit coaming somewhat raisedforward.[N435]    [Footnote N433: Journal, p. 233.]    [Footnote N434: Second voyage, p. 506, and pls. opposite pp. 274    and 508.]    [Footnote N435: There is quite a discrepancy in regard to this    between Capt. Lyon’s description referred to above and the two    plates drawn by him in Parry’s second voyage. In his journal he    speaks of the coaming of the cockpit being about 9 inches higher    forward than it is aft, while from his figures the difference does    not appear to be more than 3 or 4 inches.]In the kaiaks used at the Anderson and Mackenzie rivers, as shown bythe models in the National Museum, the bending up of the stem andstern posts is carried to an extreme, so that they make an angle ofabout 130° with the level of the deck. The bottom is round and thecockpit nearly level, but sufficient room for the knees and feet isobtained by arching not only the deck beams just forward of thecockpit, but all of them from stem to stern, so that the deck slopesaway to each side like the roof of a house. At Point Barrow, asalready described, the deck beams are arched only just forward of thecockpit, and the stem and stern are not prolonged. This appears to bethe prevailing form of canoe at least as far south as Kotzebue Soundand is sometimes used by the Malemiut of Norton Sound. At PortClarence the heavy, large kaiak, so common from Norton Soundsouthward, appears to be in use from Nordenskiöld’s description, as hespeaks of the kaiaks holding two persons, sitting back to back in thecockpit.[N436] The kaiaks of the southwestern Eskimo are, as far as Ihave been able to learn, large and heavy, with level coamings, withthe deck quite steeply arched fore and aft, and with bow and sternusually of some peculiar shape, as shown by models in the Museum. Seealso Dall’s figure (Alaska, p. 15.)[N437]    [Footnote N436: Vega, vol. 2, p. 228.]    [Footnote N437: I have confined myself in the above comparison    simply to the kaiaks used by undoubted Eskimo. I find merely    casual references to the kaiaks used on the Siberian coast by the    Asiatic Eskimo and their companions the Sedentary Chuckchis, while    a discussion of the canoes of the Aleuts would carry me beyond the    limits of the present work.]While the kaiak, however, differs so much in external appearance indifferent localities, it is probable that in structure it iseverywhere essentially the same. Only two writers have given adetailed description of the frame of a kaiak, and these are fromwidely distant localities, Iglulik and western Greenland, both stillmore widely distant from Point Barrow, and yet both give essentiallythe same component parts as are to be found at Point Barrow, namely,two comparatively stout gunwales running from stem to stern, bracedwith transverse deckbeams,[N438] seven streaks running fore and aftalong the bottom, knees, or ribs in the form of hoops, and a hoop forthe coaming, bound together with whalebone or sinew.[N439]    [Footnote N438: Since the above was written Boas has published a    detailed description of the central kaiaks, in which he says there    are only four streaks besides the keel (Central Eskimo, p. 486).]    [Footnote N439: Dr. Kane’s description, though the best that we    have of the flat-bottomed Greenland kaiak and accompanied by    diagrams, is unfortunately vague in some important respects. It is    in brief as follows: “The skeleton consists of three longitudinal    strips of wood on each side * * * stretching from end to end.    * * * The upper of these, the gunwale * * * is somewhat stouter    than the others. The bottom is framed by three similar    longitudinal strips. These are crossed by other strips or hoops,    which perform the office of knees and ribs. They are placed at a    distance of not more than 8 to 10 inches from one another.    Wherever the parts of this framework meet or cross they are bound    together with reindeer tendon very artistically. * * * The _pah_    or manhole * * * has a rim or lip secured upon the gunwale and    rising a couple of inches above the deck.” (First Grinnell Exp.,    p. 477.) It will be seen that he does not mention any deck beams,    which would be very necessary to keep the gunwales spread apart.    They are shown, however, on Crantz’s crude section of a kaiak    frame. (History of Greenland, vol. 1, pl. vii), and are evidently    mortised into the gunwale, as at Point Barrow. Crantz also    (op. cit., p. 150) speaks of the use of whalebone for fastening    the frame together.    Capt. Lyon’s description of the round-bottomed kaiak used at Fury    and Hecla Straits (Journal, p. 233) is much more explicit. He    describes the frame as consisting of a gunwale on each side 4 or 5    inches wide in the middle and three-fourths inch thick, tapering    at each end, sixty-four hoop-shaped ribs (on a canoe 25 feet    long), seven slight rods outside of the ribs, twenty-two    deck-beams, and a batten running fore and aft, and a hoop round    the cockpit. These large kaiaks weigh 50 or 60 pounds. There is a    very good figure of the Point Barrow kaiak, paddled with a single    paddle, in Smyth’s view of Nuwŭk (Beechey’s Voyage, pl. opposite    p. 307).]  [Illustration: FIG. 341.--Model kaiak and paddle. 1/4]The double-bladed paddle is almost exclusively an Eskimo contrivance.The only other hyperborean race, besides the Aleuts, who use it, arethe Yukagirs, who employ it in their narrow dugout canoes on the RiverKolyma in Siberia.[N440] Double-bladed paddles have also been observedin the Malay Archipelago.    [Footnote N440: Wrangell, Narrative of an Expedition, etc.,    p. 161, footnote.]Fig. 341, (No. 56561 [224] from Utkiavwiñ) is a very neatly made modelof a kaiak, 13.3 inches long. It is quite accurate in all its details,but has only five streaks on the bottom, and its width and depth areabout twice what they should be in proportion to the length. The frameis lashed together with fine sinew and covered with seal entrail. Thepaddle is also out of proportion. Many similar neatly finished modelswere made for sale. The natives are so skillful in making them that itis possible that they are in the habit of making them for the childrento play with. I do not, however, recollect ever seeing a child withone._Umiaks and fittings._--The large skin-covered open boat, essentiallythe same in model as that employed by almost all Eskimo, as well asthe Aleuts and some Siberian races, is the chief means of conveyanceby water, for traveling, hunting, and fishing. Though the women do agreat share of the work of navigating the boat when a single family ora small party is making a journey, it is by no means considered as awoman’s boat, as appears to be the case among the Greenlanders andeastern Eskimo generally.[N441] On the contrary, women are notadmitted into the regularly organized whaling crews, unless theumialik can not procure men enough, and in the “scratch” crewsassembled for walrus hunting or sealing there are usually at least asmany men as women, and the men work as hard as the women. I do not,however, recollect that I ever saw a man pull an oar in the umiak.They appear always to use paddles alone. This is interesting inconnection with the Greenland custom mentioned by Egede in thecontinuation of the passage just quoted: “And when they first set outfor the whale fishing, the men sit in a very negligent posture, withtheir faces turned towards the prow, pulling with their littleordinary paddle; but the women sit in the ordinary way, with theirfaces towards the stern, rowing with long oars.”    [Footnote N441: For example: “For they think it unbecoming a man    to row such a boat, unless great necessity requires it.” Egede,    Greenland, p. 111. “It would be a scandal for a man to meddle,    except the greatest necessity compels him to lend a hand.” Crantz,    vol. 1, p. 149.]We were unable to bring home any specimen of these boats on account oftheir size, but Fig. 342, from a photograph by Lieut. Ray, will give agood idea of the framework. These boats vary considerably in size, butare usually very nearly the dimensions of an ordinary whaleboat--thatis, about 30 feet in length, with a beam of 5 or 6 feet and a depth ofabout 2½ feet. The boat resembles very much in model the Americanfisherman’s dory, having a narrow flat bottom, sharp at both ends,with flaring sides, and considerable rake at stem and stern. Bothfloor and rail have a strong sheer, fore and aft, and the gunwalesextend beyond the stem so as to meet at the bow. Both stem and sternare sharp nearly to the rail, where they flare out and are cut offsquare. These boats are exceedingly light and buoyant, and capable ofconsiderable speed when fully manned. They are very “quick” in theirmotion and quite crank till they get down to their bearings, butbeyond that appear to be very stiff.I never heard of one being capsized, though the natives move aboutaboard of them with perfect freedom. The frame is neatly made ofpieces of driftwood, which it usually takes a considerable time toaccumulate.[N442]    [Footnote N442: Part of the description of the umiak frame is    taken from the model (No. 56563 [225]), as the writer not only had    few opportunities for careful examination of these canoes, but    unfortunately did not realize at the time the importance of    detail.]A stout square timber, of perhaps 3 inches scantling, runs along themiddle of the bottom forming a keel or keelson. This of necessity isusually made of several pieces of wood scarfed together and fastenedwith treenails and whalebone lashings. At each end it is fastened inthe same way to the stem and sternpost, which are both of the sameshape, broad and flat above or inside, but beveled off to a keeloutside, and curving up in a knee, at the same time tapering off tothe point where the bow (or stern) begins to flare. Here it ismortised into the under side of a trapezoidal block of wood, widestand thickest on the inboard end, and concaved off on the under face,to a thin edge outboard. It is held on by a transverse lashing passingthrough holes in the end of the post and the thickest part of theblock. Along each side of the bottom, at what would be the bilge of around bottom boat, runs a stout streak, thinner and wider than thekeelson and set up edgewise. These are spread apart amidships, butbent together fore and aft so as to be scarfed into the stem andsternpost (see diagram, Fig. 343_a_).  [Illustration: FIG. 342.--Frame of umiak.]On the model they are fastened here with treenails, and this isprobably also the case on the large canoes. They are spread apart bycross pieces or floor timbers, flat rather broad boards laid acrossthe keelson with their ends mortised into the bilge streaks. These arelongest amidships and decrease regularly in length fore and aft. Therewere fifteen of them on Nikawáalu’s umiak. On the model they arepegged to the keelson and bilge streaks. The ribs are straight,slender, square timbers, eighteen on each side (on Nikawáalu’s umiak;the canoe photographed has fifteen). These are all of the same length,but fitted obliquely to the outer edge of the bilge-streaks in such away (see diagram, Fig. 343_b_) that those amidships slant considerablyoutward while the others become gradually more and more erect fore andaft, thus producing the sheer in the lines. To these ribs, inside,a little below the middle of each, is fastened a streak on each side,of about the dimensions of the bilge streak, running from stem tostern, and the gunwales are fitted into the notched ends of the ribs,where they are secured by lashings of whalebone. These on Nikawáalu’sumiak were each a single round pole about 2 inches in diameter. Suchlong pieces of wood as this were probably obtained by trade from theNunatañmeun. These extend about 2½ or 3 feet beyond the stem, to whichthey are fastened on each side by whalebone lashings, and meet at asharp angle, being lashed together with whalebone. On the model, thislashing passes through holes in both gunwales and round underneath.The gunwales are fastened to the sternpost in the same way as to thestem, in both cases resting on the upper surface of the block so as toform a low rail, but project only 5 or 6 inches.  [Illustration: FIG. 343.--Construction of umiak: (_a_) method of  fastening bilge streaks to stem; (_b_) method of framing rib to  gunwale, etc.]Between the post and the last pair of long ribs at each end are twopairs of short ribs running only from the gunwale to the insidestreak. The frame is still further strengthened by an outside streakbetween the bilge streak and the inside streak, and Nikawáalu’s canoehad an extra streak of “half-round” willow outside of the latter. Thethwarts rest on the inside streak and are secured by whalebonelashings. The block or head of the stern-post serves as a high seatfor the steersman. Crantz’s[N443] description and diagram show thatthe frame of the Greenland umiak consists of essentially the sametimbers, lacking only the two outside streaks.    [Footnote N443: History of Greenland, vol. 1, p. 148, and pl. vi.]The cover is made of the skins of the larger marine animals. Walrushide is often used and sometimes the skin of the polar bear, whichmakes a beautifully white cover, but the skin of the bearded seal ispreferred, the people from Point Barrow sometimes making journeys toWainwright Inlet in search of such skins, which are dressed with theiroil in them in the manner already referred to. We were informed thatsix of these skins were required to cover one umiak. They are puttogether in the same way as the skins for the kaiak and sewed with thesame seam. The edges of the cover are stretched over the gunwale, andlaced to the inside streak with a stout thong, which passes throughholes in the edge of the cover. At stem and stern the cover is lacedwith a separate thong to a stout transverse lashing of thong runningfrom gunwale to gunwale close to the edge of the posthead.The cover is removed in the winter and stowed away on the cache frameor some other safe place (Mûñialu, when preparing to start for thespring deer hunt in 1883, carefully buried his boat cover in asnowbank) out of reach of the dogs, and the frame is placed bottomupwards on a staging 4 or 5 feet from the ground.When they are ready to refit the canoe for the spring whaling, a holeis cut in the sea ice close to the shore, and the cover immersed inthe sea water for several days to soften it, the hole being coveredwith slabs of snow to keep it from freezing up. Crantz[N444] mentionsa similar custom in Greenland. After removing the hair from theboat-skins “they lay them in salt water for some days to soften themagain, and so cover the women’s boats and kajaks with them.” When notin use, the umiak is drawn up on the beach and usually laid bottomupward with the gear, spears, etc., underneath it, but sometimespropped up on one gunwale to make a shelter against the wind. This isa common practice in the camp at Pernyû, where there is usually atleast one boat set up edgewise, sheltered by which the men sit towhittle and gossip.    [Footnote N444: Vol. 1, p. 167.]In the whaling camp at Imêkpûñ in 1883, the boats which were not readyto go out to the open water were laid up bottom up with one endresting on a sled set up on its side and the other supported by ablock of snow. They do not appear to be in the habit of using thecanoe for a tent, as is said to be the custom among the more southernnatives,[N445] as they always carry a tent with them on theirjourneys. The umiak is propelled by paddles, oars, and a sail, and insmooth weather when the shore is clear of ice by “tracking” along thebeach with men and dogs, one person at least always remaining on boardto steer with a paddle at the stern.    [Footnote N445: See Kotzebue’s Voyage, etc., vol. 1, p. 216.]The sail, which they are only able to use with a free wind, is square,narrow, and rather high, and is nowadays always made of drilling. Darkblue drilling appeared to be the most popular sort at the time of ourvisit. The head of the sail is laced to a light yard, and hoisted tothe masthead by a halyard through a hole in the latter. The mast is astout square pole 10 or 12 feet long and is set up well forward ofamidships, without a step, the square butt resting against a bottomboard, and held up by two forestays and two backstays, running fromthe masthead to the inside streak. All the rigging, stays, halyards,towing line, etc., are made of stout thong. The Greenlanders set upthe mast in the bow of the umiak--as a sailor would say, “in the veryeyes of her,”[N446] but as far as I can learn the Western Eskimo allset it up as at Point Barrow.    [Footnote N446: This is also the custom among the Central Eskimo.    (See Boas “Central Eskimo,” p. 528, Fig. 481.)]The oars are very clumsily made with very narrow blades not over 3inches broad. They are about 7 feet long and somewhat enlarged at theloom. Instead of resting in rowlocks, they are secured by two longloops of thong as in the diagram Fig. 344. To keep the oar fromchafing the skin on the gunwale, they lash to the latter a long plateof bone. No. 89696 [1197] from Utkiavwĭñ is one of these plates. Twoof these oars are commonly used in an umiak, one forward and one aft,and the women row with great vigor, swinging well from the hips, butdo not keep stroke. The use of oars is so unusual among savages thatit would be natural to suppose that these people had adopted thecustom from the whites. If this be the case, the custom reached themlong ago, and through very indirect channels.When Thomas Simpson, in 1837, bought an umiak from some Point Barrownatives at Dease Inlet, he bought with it “four of their slender oars,which they used as tent poles, besides a couple of paddles; fitted theoars with lashings, and arranged our strange vessel so well that theladies were in raptures, declaring us to be genuine Esquimaux, and notpoor white men.”[N447] The custom, moreover, appears to be widespreadsince Lyon speaks of seeing in 1821, “two very clumsy oars with flatblades, pulled by women,” in the umiaks at Hudson Strait.[N448] It waspracticed at a still earlier date in Greenland.[N449]    [Footnote N447: Narrative, p. 148.]    [Footnote N448: Journal, p. 30. Compare also Chappell, “Hudson    Bay,” p. 57.]    [Footnote N449: See Egedo, Greenland, p. 111.]  [Illustration: FIG. 344.--Method of slinging the oar of umiak.]While at Point Barrow the oars have very narrow blades and the doublepaddles very broad ones, the reverse seemed to be the case inGreenland, where the double paddle, as already noticed, has blades notover 3 or 4 inches broad. Crantz describes the oars as “short andbroad before, pretty much like a shovel, but only longer, and * *confined to their places on the gunnel with a strap of seal’sleather.” (Vol. 2, p. 149 and pl. VI) Although both oars and sails areundoubtedly quite ancient inventions (Frobisher in his description ofMeta Incognita in Hakluyt’s Voyages (1589) pp. 621 and 628, speaks ofskin boats with sails of entrail),[N450] I am strongly inclined tobelieve that they are both considerably more recent than the paddles,not only on general principles, but from the fact that the whalingumiaks at Point Barrow use only paddles. There is no practical reasonagainst using either oars or sails, and in fact the latter would oftenbe of great advantage in silently approaching a whale, as the Americanwhalemen have long ago discovered. It seems to me that this is merelyanother case of adhering to an obsolete custom on semireligiousgrounds. The paddles are usually about 4 or 5 feet long, made of onepiece of driftwood, with slender round shafts, and lanceolate bladesabout 6 inches broad, and a short rounded cross handle at the upperend. (Fig. 345 shows two of the paddles belonging to the model.) Thesteersman uses a longer paddle, and stands in the stern or sits up onthe head of the sternpost.    [Footnote N450: These passages being, as far as I know, the    earliest description of the umiak and kaiak are worth quotation:    “Their boats are made all of Seale skins, with a keel of wood    within the skinne; the proportion of them is like a Spanish    shallop, saue only they be flat in the bottome, and sharp at both    endes” (p. 621, 1576). Again: “They haue two sorts of boats made    of leather, set out on the inner side with quarters of wood,    artificially tyed with thongs of the same; the greater sort are    not much unlike our wherries, wherein sixteene or twenty men may    sitte; they have for a sayle, drest the guttes of such beasts as    they kill, very fine and thinne, which they sewe together; the    other boate is but for one man to sitte and rowe in, with one    oare” (p. 628, 1577).]  [Illustration: FIG. 345.--Model of umiak and paddles: (_a_) side  view; (_b_) inside plan.]Fig. 345_a_ represents the model (No. 56563 [225] from Utkiavwĭñ),which gives a very good idea of the shape of one of these boats. It isquite correct in all its parts, though the timbers are rather tooheavy, and there are not so many ribs and floor timbers as in afull-sized canoe. The breadth of beam, 6.2 inches, is at least 1 inchtoo great in proportion to the length, 25 inches. The cover is onepiece of seal skin which has been partially tanned by the“white-tanning” process, and put on wet. In drying it has turnedalmost exactly the color of a genuine boat cover. The frame, as isoften the case with a full-sized boat, is painted all over with redocher. (See Fig. 345_b_, inside plan.)  [Illustration: FIG. 346.--Ivory bailer for umiak. 1/4]For bailing these boats a long narrow dipper of ivory or bone is used,of such a shape as to be especially well suited for working in betweenthe floor timbers. Fig. 346 represents one of these (No. 56536 [40]from Utkiavwĭñ). It is a piece of walrus tusk 16.3 inches long. Thecavity is 1.1 inches deep and was excavated by drilling vertical holesand cutting away the substance between them. Some of the holes havenot been completely worked out. A similar bailer (No. 89835 [1010]also from Utkiavwĭñ) is made of reindeer antler, a substance much moreeasily worked than the ivory, as the soft interior tissue exposed bycutting the upper side flat is readily carved out. As with the walrustusk, the natural curve of the material gives the proper inclinationto the handle. It is 18.3 inches long.When the umiak is fitted out for whaling a stout #U#-shaped crotch ofivory or bone, about 7 inches long and 5 wide, is lashed between thegunwales where they meet at the bow. In this the heavy harpoon restswhen they are approaching a whale. It is only used when whaling. TheMuseum collection contains specimens of this sort from as far south asthe Diomede Islands.We brought home five specimens of these kû´nnɐ, of which No. 56510[117] Fig. 347 has been selected as the type. This is made of twobilaterally symmetrical pieces of white walrus ivory, each piececonsisting of one arm of the crotch and half the shank. Its totallength is 7.8 inches. The two pieces are held together by a stoutwooden tree-nail, and above this a lashing of sinew-braid, lodged intwo deep vertical channels one on each side of the shank just belowthe arms, and wedged above and below on both sides with slips of wood.A hole is drilled through each side of the butt close to the end, andthrough these a lashing is stretched across the reentering angle ofthe butt consisting of four turns of sinew braid with the end closelywrapped round the parts between the holes, and neatly tucked in.  [Illustration: FIG. 347.--Ivory crotch for harpoon. 1/3]Just at the bend of each arm is a small round becket hole, runningobliquely from the back to the outer side. In each of these is a neatbecket, about ¾ inches long, made of several turns of sinew braid,with the end neatly wrapped around them. These beckets serve toreceive the lashings for attaching the crotch to the gunwales. All theornamental figures are incised and blackened.Three of the remaining four specimens are of walrus-ivory, and ofessentially the same pattern, differing only in ornamentation andother minor details. No. 56511 [116], from Utkiavwĭñ, is almostexactly like the type and of very nearly the same size. It is fastenedtogether with a lashing only, but no treenail, and the beckets havebeen removed from the becket holes. The border is colored with redocher, and there are two whales’ tails instead of one on the shank.The other two have the tips of the arms carved into the shape ofwhales’ heads. No. 89418 [1224], Fig. 348, from Utkiavwĭñ, isotherwise of the same shape as those already described, but is lashedtogether with stout seal thong, and has four beckets of the samematerial, two in the usual position and two at the widest part of theshank. These take the place of the loop running across the butt. Onthe middle of the back of each arm is a small cross incised andblackened with a small blue glass bead inlaid in the center, and thereare two whale’s tails on the opposite face of the shank. It is 8inches long.No. 89419 [926], from Nuwŭk, has a nearly straight shank with a flangeon each side at the butt. It is lashed together with whalebone and hasalso a treenail, like the type. The upper beckets are of sinew-braid.A large becket at the butt is made by looping and knotting the ends ofa bit of thong into a hole in each flange. There is one whale’s tailengraved on the front of the shank. When lashed in position the frontor ornamental side faces inboard, as is indicated by the shape of theshank, which is slightly narrower behind than in front, so as to fitbetween the converging gunwales. No. 8917 [1104], Fig. 349, fromNuwuk, the only one of the kind seen, is a very interesting form. Itis made by cutting a horizontal slice out of the lower jaw of awalrus, so that it form the arms of the crotch, while the thicksymphysis is cut into a shank of the usual shape, with the two upperbeckets in the usual place and a large one at the butt, passingthrough a transverse hole. These beckets are roughly made of thong.Its total length is 6.6 inches.  [Illustration: FIG. 348.--Ivory crotch for harpoon.]  [Illustration: FIG. 349.--Crotch for harpoon made of walrus jaw.]This specimen from its soiled condition is undoubtedly quite ancient,and probably of an older type than the highly ornamented ivorycrotches of the present day. The latter are evidently only copies ofthe jawbone crotch in a material susceptible of a higher finish thanthe coarse bone. The only reason for making them in two pieces is thatit is impossible to get a single piece of walrus ivory large enoughfor a whole one. It seems to me highly probable that the crotch wassuggested by the natural shape of the walrus jaw, since these arefrequently used for crotches to receive the cross pieces of the cacheframes. Perhaps, for a while, the whole jaw was simply lashed to thebow of the boat. The next step would obviously be to cut out the shankand reduce the weight of the crotch by trimming off the superfluousmaterial. The reason for making the crotch of ivory is perhaps purelyesthetic; but more likely connected with the notions already referredto which lead them to clean up their boats and gear and adornthemselves and paint their faces when they go to the whale fishery.Although, as I have already stated, there appears to be no essentialdifference in the general plan of the frame of the Greenland umiaksand those used at Point Barrow, there seems to be considerabledifference in the size and outward appearance. As well as can bejudged from the brief descriptions and rude figures of variousauthors[N451] and various models in the National Museum (thecorrectness of which, however, I can not be sure of, without havingseen the originals) the umiak not only in Greenland, but among theEskimo generally as far west as the Mackenzie, is a much more wallsided square ended boat than at Point Barrow, having less sheer to thegunwales with the stem and stern-post nearly vertical.[N452] Mr. L. M.Turner informs me that this is the case at Ungava Bay. It was also alarger boat. Egede says that they “are large and open * * * some ofthem 20 yards long;”[N453] Crantz gives their length as “commonly 6,nay 8 or 9 fathoms long;”[N454] Kumlien says that it required “aboutfifteen skins of Phoca barbata” to cover an umiak at CumberlandGulf,[N455] and Mr. Turner informs me that eight are used at Ungava.Capt. Parry found no umiaks at Fury and Hecla straits[N456] andKumlien says that they are becoming rare at Cumberland Gulf. Theso-called Arctic Highlanders of Smith Sound have no boats of any kind.The model used at Point Barrow probably prevails as far south asKotzebue Sound. The boats that boarded us off Wainwright Inlet in theautumn of 1883, and those of the Nunatañmiun who visited Point Barrow,seemed not to differ from those with which we were familiar, exceptthat the latter were rather light and low sided, nor do I rememberanything peculiar about the boats which we saw at Plover Bay in 1881.    [Footnote N451: Compare for instance Kane’s figure 1st Grinnell    Exp. p. 422, and Lyon, Journal, p. 30.]    [Footnote N452: See Beechey Voyage, p. 252. In describing the    umiaks at Hotham Inlet he says: “The model differs from that of    the umiak of the Hudson Bay in being sharp at both ends.” Smyth    gives a good figure of the Hotham Inlet craft in the plate    opposite p. 250.]    [Footnote N453: Greenland, p. 111.]    [Footnote N454: Vol. 1, p. 148.]    [Footnote N455: Contributions, p. 43. Boas, however, says three to    five skins. (Central Eskimo, p. 528.)]    [Footnote N456: 2d Voy., p. 507.]There is very little accessible detailed information regarding theumiaks used in the rest of Alaska. From Dall’s figure[N457] and a fewmodels in the Museum, the Norton Sound umiak appears to have thegunwales united at both stem and stern. Those that we saw at St.Michael’s in 1883, were so much modified by Russian ideas as to bewholly out of the line of comparison. The same is true of the Aleutian“baidara,” if, indeed, the latter be an umiak at all.    [Footnote N457: Alaska, p. 15.]TRAVELING ON FOOT._Snowshoes (tûglu.)_--Snowshoes of a very efficient pattern and verywell made are now universally employed at Point Barrow. Although thesnow never lies very deep on the ground, and is apt to pile up in harddrifts, it is sufficiently deep and soft in many places, especially onthe grassy parts of the tundra, to make walking without snowshoes veryinconvenient and fatiguing. I have even seen them used on the sea icefor crossing level spaces when a few inches of snow had fallen.Practically, every man in the two villages, and many of the women andboys, have each their own pair of snowshoes, fitted to their size.Each shoe consists of a rim of light wood, bent into the shape of apointed oval, about five times as long as the greatest breadth, andmuch bent up at the rounded end, which is the toe. The sides arebraced apart by two stout cross-bars (_toe_ and _heel bar_) a littlefarther apart than the length of the wearer’s foot. The space betweenthese two bars is netted in large meshes (_foot netting_) with stoutthong for the foot to rest upon, and the spaces at the ends areclosely netted with fine deerskin “babiche”[N458] (_toe_ and _heelnetting_). The straps for the foot are fastened to the foot netting insuch a way that while the strap is firmly fastened round the ankle thesnowshoe is slung to the toe. The wearer walks with long swingingstrides, lifting the toe of the shoe at each step, while the tail orheel drags in the snow. The straps are so contrived that the foot canbe slipped in and out of them without touching them with the fingers,a great advantage in cold weather. When deer hunting, according toLieut. Ray, they take a long piece of thong and knot each end of it tothe toe of one snowshoe. The bight is then looped into the belt behindso that the snowshoes drag out of the way of the heels. When they wishto put on the shoes they draw them up, insert their feet in thestraps, and fasten the slack of the lines into the belt in front witha slip knot. When, however, they come to a piece of ground wheresnowshoes are not needed, they kick them off, slip the knots, and letthem “drop astern.”    [Footnote N458: Twisted sinew is sometimes used. A pair of    snowshoes from Point Barrow, owned by the writer, are netted with    this material.]We brought home three pairs of snowshoes, which represent very wellthe form in general use. No. 89912 [1736], Fig. 350, has been selectedas the type. The rim is of willow, 51 inches long and 10½ inches wideat the broadest part, and is made of two strips about 1 inch thick and¾ wide, joined at the toe by a long lap-splice, held together by fourshort horizontal or slightly oblique stitches of thong. Each strip iselliptical in section, with the long axis vertical, and keeled on theinner face, except between the bars. Each is tapered off considerablyfrom the toe bar to the toe, and slightly tapered toward the heel. Thetwo points are fastened together by a short horizontal stitch ofwhalebone. The tip is produced into a slight “tail,” and the innerside of each shoe is slightly straighter than the outer--that is tosay, they are “rights and lefts.”  [Illustration: FIG. 350.--Snowshoe. 1/8]The bars are elliptical in section, flattened, and have their endsmortised into the rim. They are about a foot apart, and of oak, thetoe bar 9.2 inches long and the heel bar 8.5. Both are of the samebreadth and thickness, 1 by ½ inch. There is also an extra bar forstrengthening the back part of the shoe 10 inches from the point. Itis also of oak, 4.8 inches long, 0.5 wide, and 0.3 thick. The toe andheel nettings are put on first. Small equidistant vertical holes runround the inside of each space. Those in the rim are drilled throughthe keel already mentioned, and joined by a shallow groove above andbelow; those in the bars are about ½ inch from the edge and joined bya groove on the under side of the toe bar only. Into these holes islaced a piece of babiche, which is knotted once into each hole, makinga series of beckets about ¾ inch wide round the inside of the space.There are no lacing holes in the parts spliced at the toe, but thelacing passes through a bight of each stitch. At the toe bar thelacing is carried straight across from rim to rim about three times,the last part being wound round the others.On the left shoe the end is brought back on the left-hand side, passedthrough the first hole in the bar from above, carried along in thegroove on the underside to the next hole, up through this and roundthe lacing, and back through the same hole, the two parts beingtwisted together between the bar and lacing. This is continued,“stopping” the lacing in festoons to the bar, to the last hole on theright, where it is finished off by knotting the end round the last“stop.” The stops are made, apparently, by a separate piece on theright shoe. The lacing on the heel bar is also double or triple, butthe last part, which is wound round the others, is knotted into eachhole as on the rim. The lacings on the rim of the heel space areknotted with a single knot round each end of the extra bar.In describing the nettings it will always be understood that the uppersurface of the shoe is toward the workman, with the point upward, ifdescribing the heel nettings, and vice versa for the toe. To beginwith the heel netting, which is the simpler: This is in two parts, onefrom the heel bar to the extra bar (heel netting proper) and one fromthe latter to the point (point netting). The netting is invariablyfastened to the lacing by passing the end through the becket fromabove and bringing it back over itself. In making the point nettingthe end of the babiche is knotted round the bar at the right-handlower corner with a single knot. The other end goes up to the lacingat the point and comes down to the left-hand lower corner, where it ishitched round the bar, as in Fig. 351, then goes up to the lowestbecket on the left side, crosses to the corresponding one on theright, and comes down and is hitched as before round the bar inside ofthe starting point. This makes a series of strands round the outsideof the space, two running obliquely from right to left, a long one onthe right side and a short one on the left side; two similar strandsfrom left to right, the long one on the left and the short one on theright, and one transverse strand at the base of the triangle (seediagram, Fig. 352_a_). The next round goes up to the first becket atthe top on the left hand, crosses to the corresponding one on theright, and then makes the same strands as the first round, runningparallel to them and about half an inch nearer the center of the space(see diagram, Fig. 352_b_). Each successive round follows the last,coming each time about ½ inch nearer the center, till the space is allfilled in, which brings the end of the last round to the middle of thebar, round which it is knotted with a single knot. This makes threesets of strands, two obliquely longitudinal, one set from right toleft and one from left to right, and one transverse, all of each setparallel and equidistant, or nearly so, and each interwovenalternately over and under each successive strand it meets.  [Illustration: FIG. 351.--Knot in snowshoe.]The right shoe has fourteen longitudinal strands in each set andthirteen transverse; the left, one less in each set. On the left shoethe end is carried up from the last knot to the lacing at the point,and then comes back to the bar, fastening the other part to thenetting with six equidistant half-hitches. The heel netting proper isput on in a slightly different fashion, as the space to be filled isno longer triangular. It starts as before in the right hand lowercorner, where it is knotted into the becket, running across from therim to the heel-bar; goes up to the middle of the extra bar, roundwhich it is hitched as already described, then down to the left handlower corner; up to the first becket on the left rim, across to thecorresponding one on the right, and down to the first becket on theheel bar. This completes the first round (see diagram, Fig. 353_a_).The second round goes up to the hind bar at the left of the first,comes down only to the transverse strand of the first round on theleft, goes up to the becket on the rim above the first, crosses to theright, and comes back to the transverse turn of the first rounds. Allthese strands except the transverse one are on the left of the firstround. The third round follows the first, which brings all its strandsexcept the transverse one to the right of the first round (seediagram, Fig. 353_b_). The successive odd rounds follow the first andthe even rounds the second, bringing the longitudinal strandsalternately to the right and left of the first round, until the endsof the hind bar are reached--that is to say, till the space _outside_of the first round is filled--each transverse strand coming above thepreceding. This is done regularly on the left shoe, the tenth roundcoming to the left end of the bar, and the eleventh to the right. Thetwelfth round comes to the becket in the left hand upper corner, andcrosses to the corresponding becket on the other side. It then followsthe odd rounds, thus making six strands, four longitudinal and twotransverse, as in the point nettings. All the remaining rounds followthis till the whole space is filled in, which brings the end of thelast round to the middle of the heel bar, where it is knotted to thebecket.  [Illustration: FIG. 352.--Point netting of snowshoe heel: (_a_)  first round; (_b_) first and second rounds.]On the right shoe the maker seems to have made a mistake at the eighthround, which obliged him to alter the order of the other strands andfinish with half a round. Instead of taking the end of the eighthround down to the preceding transverse strand only, he has brought itdown to the heel bar, which brings the ninth round to the left,following the even rounds, and coming to the end of the hind bar, thetenth to the right end of the bar, so that it is the eleventh whichmakes the first transverse turn at the top. The pattern is the same asin the point nettings. The right shoe has 25, 24, and 19 strands inthe three sets respectively, and the left, 25, 25, and 19. The toenettings are put on in the same way, the first round going to themiddle becket at the toe, and crossing to the first becket on theright hand, the second going to the first becket on the left hand andcrossing on the right to the first round, and the third going to thefirst round at the toe and crossing on the right to the becket.  [Illustration: FIG. 353.--Heel netting of snow shoe; (_a_) first  round; (_b_) first, second, and third rounds.]All the even rounds go to the becket at the toe and cross to thepreceding even round, and all the odd rounds go to the preceding oddround at the toe and cross to the becket, until the space outside ofthe first round is filled with longitudinal strands, when they beginto make descending transverse turns across the toe, going from thebecket on the left to the corresponding one on the right and thusfollowing the odd rounds. The fourteenth round on the right shoebegins this, the twelfth on the left. This brings the end of the lastround to the middle of the toe bar. It is then carried up to thebecket at the toe, brought down and up again, and the end is used tofasten these three parts to the netting with equidistant halfhitches--fourteen on the right shoe and thirteen on the left. Thepattern, of course, is the same as before, with 33, 33, and 26 strandson the right shoe, and 31, 31, and 25 on the left, in each setrespectively.The foot-netting is of a very different pattern, and consists of seventransverse and thirteen longitudinal strands, of which six, in themiddle, do not reach the toe bar, leaving an oblong transverse hole,through which the toe presses against the snow at the beginning of thestep. The cross strands are a piece of stout thong (the skin of thewalrus or bearded seal), to the end of which is spliced with doubleslits a long piece of thinner seal thong, which makes the longitudinalones. The seven transverse strands pass in and out through holes inthe rim, while the longitudinal strands pass over the bars, except themiddle three pairs, which pass round the horizontal strand behind thetoe hole, drawing it down to the next strand. The end of thethirteenth strand wattles these two firmly together, as it does alsothe two pairs of longitudinal strands on each side of the toe hole,and finishes off the netting by whipping the two sets of strandstogether with a “birdcage stitch.”The object of the complicated wattling round the toe hole is, first,to strengthen the hind border against which the toe presses inwalking, and second to give a firm attachment for the straps, whichare fastened at the junction of the doubled and twisted longitudinalstrands with the first and second transverse ones. Each strap is asingle piece of stout seal thong fastened to the shoe with two loopsas follows: At the inner side of the shoe the end is passed into thetoe hole and makes a round turn about the doubled longitudinalstrands, and then goes under the two cross strands, coming out behindthem and between the twelfth and thirteenth longitudinal strands. Itis then spliced into the standing part with two slits, making a becketabout 3 inches in diameter. The other end, leaving a loop large enoughto go round the wearer’s heel, is passed through the becket just made,wound in the same way as before round the strands at the other cornerof the toe hole, and made into a similar becket by knotting the end tothe standing part with a marlinghitch with the bight left in. On theright shoe this hitch is made in a slit in the standing part. The endis probably left long for the purpose of adjusting the length of thestrap to the wearer’s foot.In putting on the shoe, the toe is thrust sideways through the looptill the bight comes well up over the heel, and then turned round andstuck under the two beckets, which together form a strap to fasten thetoe down to the shoe, leaving the latter free to swing when the heelis raised. By reversing the process the shoe is easily kicked off.These straps must be fitted very nicely or else the shoe is apt tocome off. This is a very neatly made pair of shoes, and the woodworkis all painted red above.No. 89913 [1737] is a pair of similar shoes also from Utkiavwĭñ. Theframe is made in the same way and is wholly of willow except the extrahind bar, which is of walrus ivory. These shoes are shorter andsomewhat broader than the preceding and not so well made. They are48.5 inches long and 11 broad. The two shoes are not perceptiblydifferent in shape. The lacing, which is of sinew braid, is put on inthe same way as on the preceding pair, except that it is fasteneddirectly into the holes on the toe bars. The whole of the heel nettingis in one piece, and made precisely in the same way as the pointnettings of the first pair, the end being carried up the middle to thepoint of the heel and brought down again to the bar as on the toenettings, but fastened with marling hitches. The number of strands isthe same in each shoe, twenty-three in each set. The toe nettingsfollow quite regularly the pattern of the preceding pair.  [Illustration: FIG. 354.--Small snowshoe. 1/8]The shoes are not quite the same size, as the right has 35, 35, and 28strands, and the left 33, 33, and 25, in each set respectively. Thereis no regular rule about the number of strands in any part of thenetting, the object being simply to make the meshes always about thesame size. The foot netting is made of stout and very white thong fromthe bearded seal. These shoes have no strings.No. 89914 [1738] is a pair of rather small shoes from Utkiavwĭñ, oneof which is shown in Fig. 354. They are rights and lefts, and are 42inches long by 10 broad. The frame is wholly of oak, and differs fromthe type only in having no extra hind bar, and having the heel and toebars about equal in length. The points are fastened together with atreenail, as well as with a whalebone stitch. The heel-nettings areput on with perfect regularity, as on the pair last described, but thetoe-nettings, though they start in the usual way, do not follow anyregular rule of sucession, the rounds being put on sometimes insideand sometimes outside of the preceding, till the whole space isfilled. The foot-nettings are somewhat clumsily made, especially onthe right shoe, which appears to have been broken in several places,and “cobbled” by an unskillful workman. There are only five transversestrands which are double on the left shoe, and the longitudinalstrands are not whipped to these, but interwoven, and each pairtwisted together between the transverse strands. There is no wattlingback of the toe hole, and one pair of longitudinal strands at the sideof the latter is not doubled on the left shoe. The strings are put onas on the type except that the ends are knotted instead of beingspliced. This pair of shoes was used by the writer on many shortexcursions around the station during the winters of 1881-’82 and1882-’83. They were old when purchased.I had but one opportunity of seeing the process of making the framesof the snowshoes. Ilûbw’ga, the “inland” native frequently mentioned,a particularly skillful workman, undertook to make a pair of snowshoesfor Lieut. Ray at our quarters, but did not succeed in finishing them,as the ash lumber which we brought from San Francisco proved toobrittle for the purpose. Having a long piece of wood, he “got out” thewhole rim in one piece. Ordinarily the splice at the toe must be made,at least temporarily, before the frame can be bent into shape. Hesoftened up the wood by wrapping it in rags wet with hot water. Someof the other natives, however, recommended that the wood should beimmersed in the salt water for a day or two, from which I infer thatthis is a common practice. After slowly bending the toe, with greatcare, nearly into shape, he inserted into the bend a flat block ofwood of the proper shape for the toe and lashed the frame to this.A pointed block was also used to give the proper shape to the heel;the bars being inserted in the mortises before the ends were broughttogether. The temporary lashings are kept on till the wood dries intoshape. The toes are turned up by tying the shoes together, sole tosole, and inserting a transverse stick between the tips of the toes.The use of finely finished snowshoes of this pattern is ofcomparatively recent date at Point Barrow. Dr. Simpson[N459] isexplicit concerning the use of snowshoes in his time (1853-’55). Hesays: “Snowshoes are so seldom used in the north where the driftedsnow presents a hard frozen surface to walk upon, that certainly nothalf a dozen pairs were in existence at Point Barrow at the time ofour arrival, and those were of an inferior sort.” I have alreadymentioned the universal employment of these snowshoes at the presentday, so that the custom must have arisen in the last thirty years. Thepattern of shoe now used is identical with those of the Tinné orAthabascan Indians (as is plainly shown by the National Museumcollections), and I am inclined to believe that the Point Barrownatives have learned to use them from the “Nunatañmiun,” from whom,indeed, they purchase ready-made snowshoes at the present day, as weourselves observed. The “Nunatañmiun,” or the closely related peopleof the Kuwûk River, are known to have intimate trading relations withthe Indians, and even in Simpson’s time[N460] used the Indian shoe,sometimes at least. The fact that in recent times families of the“Nunatañmiun” have established the habit of spending the winter withthe people of Point Barrow and associating with them in the winterdeer-hunt, would explain how the latter came to recognize the superiorexcellence of the Indian shoe.    [Footnote N459: Op. cit., p. 243.]    [Footnote N460: Op. cit., p. 244.]This is more likely than that they learned to use them from theeastern natives, whom they only meet for a short time in summer,though the latter used the Indian style of snowshoes at least as earlyas 1826. Franklin[N461] speaks of seeing, at Demarcation Point, a pairof snowshoes netted with cords of deerskin and shaped like those ofthe Indians of the Mackenzie.    [Footnote N461: 2d Exped., p. 142.]Most of the other Eskimo of Alaska, who need to use snowshoes at all,use a style of shoe very much less efficient and more roughly made,the rim being of heavy, rather crooked pieces of willow or alder.Simpson’s description will apply very well to this form, which is usedeven as far north as Icy Cape, whence Mr. Nelson brought home a pair.It also appears to be the prevailing, if not the only, form on theSiberian coast and St. Lawrence Island, judging from Nordinskiöld’sfigure[N462] and Mr. Nelson’s collections.    [Footnote N462: Vega, vol. 2, p. 102 _a_.]Simpson says:[N463] “The most common one is two pieces of alder, abouttwo feet and a half long, curved towards each other at the ends, wherethey are bound together, and kept apart in the middle by twocrosspieces, each end of which is held in a mortise. Between thecrosspieces is stretched a stout thong, lengthwise and across, for thefoot to rest upon, with another which first forms a loop to allow thetoes to pass beneath; this is carried round the back of the ankle tothe opposite side of the foot, so as to sling the snowshoe under thejoint of the great toe.”    [Footnote N463: Op. cit., p. 243.]When there are toe and heel nettings, they are of seal thong with alarge open mesh. The snowshoe from Norton Sound, figured byDall,[N464] is a rather neatly made variety of this form. South of theYukon, the use of the snowshoe appears to be confined to the Indians.As shown by the Museum collections, the strings are always of thepattern described throughout the whole northwestern region.[N465]    [Footnote N464: Alaska, p. 190, Fig. A.]    [Footnote N465: See, also, Dall, Alaska, p. 190, and Figs. A and    C.]Snowshoes appear to be rarely used among the eastern Eskimo. The onlywriter who mentions them is Kumlien.[N466] He says: “When travelingover the frozen wastes in winter, they [i.e., the natives ofCumberland Gulf] use snowshoes. These are half-moon shaped, ofwhalebone, with sealskin thongs tightly drawn across. They are about16 inches long. Another pattern is merely a frame of wood, about thesame length and 8 or 10 inches wide, with sealskin thongs for the footto rest on.”    [Footnote N466: Contributions, p. 42.]The latter is apparently quite like the western snowshoes described bySimpson._Staff._--The only staff used by the young and vigorous is the shaftof the spear, when one is carried. The aged and feeble, however,support their steps with one or two staffs about 5 feet long, oftenshod with bone or ivory. (The old man whom Franklin met on theCoppermine River walked with the help of two sticks.[N467]) Fig. 355from a photograph represents old Yûksĭña from Nuwŭk, with his twostaffs, without which he was hardly able to walk.    [Footnote N467: 1st Exp., vol. 2, p. 180.]  [Illustration: FIG. 355.--Old “Chief” with staffs.]LAND CONVEYANCES._Sledges._--The only land conveyance employed at Point Barrow is theuniversal sledge of the Eskimo, of which there are two forms ingeneral use, one, kă´motĭ, with a high rail on each side, andespecially intended for carrying loads of the smaller articles,clothing, camp equipage, etc., and the other (unia) low and flat,without rail or “upstander,” for carrying bulky objects, like wholecarcasses of deer, frozen seals, rough dried deerskins, etc., andespecially used for carrying the umiak across the land or solid ice.Both kinds are made without nails, but are fastened together bymortises and lashings and stitches of thong and whalebone. I have,however, seen one unia, which was made in 1883, fastened together withnails, a rather inferior substitute for the lashings, as they not onlywould not hold so firmly, but would also be liable to break in coldweather.Both kinds of sledge are made of driftwood and shod with strips ofwhale’s jaw, about three-fourths of an inch thick, fastened on withbone treenails. These bone runners, which are about 2 inches wide, runsufficiently well over ice, hard snow, the frozen gravel of the beachor even on the bare tundra, but for carrying a heavy load over thesofter snow of the interior they are shod with ice in a mannerpeculiar to this region.It is well known that not only the Eskimo generally, but otherhyperborean people coat the runners of their sleds with ice to makethem run more smoothly, but this is usually only a comparatively thincrust, produced by pouring water on the runners or applying a mixtureof snow or mud and water.[N468] Mr. Turner informs me that at Ungavathey are particular to use fine black vegetable mold for this purpose.    [Footnote N468: For example, Lyon says that at Fury and Hecla    Straits the runners are coated with ice by mixing snow and fresh    water (Journal, p. 235); (See also Parry, 2d Voyage, p. 515). At    Cumberland Gulf “they pour warmed blood on the under surface of    the bone shoeing; some use water, but this does not last nearly so    long as the blood and is more apt to chip off.” Kumlien,    Contributions, p. 42; (See also Hall, Arctic Researches, p. 582).    Around Repulse Bay they ice the runners by squirting over them    water which has been warmed in the mouth, putting on successive    layers till they get a smooth surface. This is renewed the first    thing every morning. Gilder, Schwatka’s Search, p. 66. A native of    the eastern shore of Labrador, according to Sir John Richardson    (Searching Expedition, vol. 2, p. 82), applied to the runners coat    after coat of earth or clay tempered with hot water, and then    washed the runners with water, polishing the ice with his naked    hand. MacFarlane in his MS. notes speaks of covering the sled    runners with “earth, water, and ice” in the Mackenzie region.    Petitot (Monographie, etc., p. XVII) says the runners in the    Mackenzie and Anderson district are shod with “un bourrelet de    limon et de glace,” which has to be often renewed. Nordenskiöld    says that at Pitlekaj “the runners, before the start, are    carefully covered with a layer of ice from two to three    millimeters in thickness by repeatedly pouring water over them,”    (Vega, vol. 2, p. 94), and according to Wrangell (Narrative, etc.,    p. 101, footnote) it is the common custom in northern Siberia to    pour water over the runners every evening to produce a thin crust    of ice.]The method at Point Barrow is quite different from this. To eachrunner is fitted a heavy shoe of clear ice, as long as the runner, andfully 1 foot high by 6 inches thick. The sledge with these ice runnersis estimated to weigh, even when unloaded, upwards of 200 or 300pounds, but it appears that the smoothness of running more thancounterbalances the extra weight. At any rate these shoes are almostuniversally employed on the sleds which make the long journey from therivers in the spring with heavy loads of meat, fish, and skins. Onenative, in 1883, shod his sledges with salt-water ice in this waybefore starting for the hunting grounds. As these ice shoes areusually put on at the rivers, I had no opportunity of seeing theprocess, though I have seen the sledges thus shod after their returnto the village. Lieut. Ray, who saw the process, describes it asfollows:  “From the ice on a pond that is free from fracture they cut the  pieces the length of a sled runner, 8 inches thick and 10 inches  wide; into these they cut a groove deep enough to receive the sled  runner up to the beam; the sled is carefully fitted into the groove,  and secured by pouring in water, a little at a time and allowing it  to freeze. Great care is taken in this part of the operation, for  should the workman apply more than a few drops at a time, the slab  of ice would be split and the work all to do over again; after the  ice is firmly secured the sled is turned bottom up and the ice-shoe  is carefully rounded with a knife, and then smoothed by wetting the  naked hand and passing it over the surface until it becomes  perfectly glazed.”[N469]    [Footnote N469: Rep. Point Barrow Exp., p. 27.]  [Illustration: FIG. 356.--Railed sledge, diagrammatic (from  photograph).]In traveling they take great care of these runners, keeping themsmooth and polished, and mending all cracks by pouring in fresh water.They are also careful to shade them from the noonday sun, which atthis season of the year is warm enough to loosen the shoes, for thispurpose hanging a cloth or skin over the sunny side of the sled.[N470]    [Footnote N470: Schwatka, in “Nimrod in the North,” (p. 159)    describes a practice among the “Netschillik,” of King William’s    Land, which appears very much like this, though his description is    somewhat obscure in details. It is as follows: “We found the    runners shod with pure ice. Trenches the length of the sledge are    dug in the ice, and into these the runners are lowered some two or    three inches, yet not touching the bottom of the trench by fully    the same distance. Water is then poured in and allowed to freeze,    and when the sledge is lifted out it is shod with shoes of    perfectly pure and transparent ice.” Strangely enough, these    curious ice shoes are not mentioned by Schwatka’s companions,    Gilder and Klutschak, nor by Schwatka himself in his paper on the    “Netschillik” in _Science_, although Klutschak describes and    figures a sledge made wholly of ice among the Netsillingmiut.    (“Als Eskimo, etc.” p. 76). Also referred to by Boas (“Central    Eskimo,” p. 533).]We were unfortunately not able to bring home specimens of either styleof large sled. The rail sled (kămotĭ) is usually about 8 or 9 feetlong, and 2½ to 3 feet wide, and the rail at the back not over 2½ feethigh. The thick curved runners, about 5 or 6 inches wide (see diagram,Fig. 356, made from a small photograph) meet the curved slender rails(which are usually round) in front, but are separated from them behindby four stout vertical posts on each side, increasing in length towardthe other end and mortised into the runners and rails. An equal numberof stout wooden arches half the height of the posts are mortised intothe runners, each arch a little in front of each pair of posts.A longitudinal strip runs along the middle of each side, and slats arelaid across these, supported by the arches. The sledge is rather heavyand clumsy, but usually carefully made and often painted with redocher.  [Illustration: FIG. 357.--Flat sledge.]Of the unia or flat sledge we have, fortunately a good photograph,Fig. 357. To the thick straight wooden runners are fastened directlyseven cross slats, which project about 2 inches at each end beyond therunner, to which they are fastened by two stitches of whalebone each.A longitudinal strip runs along above the slats on each side. Thesesledges are generally made on the same pattern, varying somewhat insize. A common size is about 6 feet long, about 2½ feet wide, and 9 or10 inches high. Very small sledges of this pattern are sometimes made,especially for the purpose, as we were told, of carrying provisions,perhaps when one or two persons desire to make a rapid journey of somelength, or for carrying a small share of meat from camp to camp.[N471]    [Footnote N471: The word used was “kau-kau.” Perhaps it referred    to a seal for food, as the sledge appears very like one described    by Hooper (Corwin Report, p. 105) as used on the “Arctic Coast.”    “When sealing on solid ice a small sled is sometimes used, the    runners of which are made of walrus tusks. It is perhaps 16 inches    long by 14 inches wide and 3 inches high. It is used in dragging    the carcass of the seal over the ice.”    We, however, never saw such sleds used for dragging seals. This    one may have been imported from farther south. See also, Beechey,    Voyage, etc., p. 251, where he speaks of seeing at Kotzebue Sound,    a drawing on ivory of “a seal dragged home on a small sledge.”]  [Illustration: FIG. 358.--Small sledge with ivory runners. 2/21]One of these (Fig. 358, No. 89889 [1140], from Utkiavwĭñ), which showssigns of long use, was brought home. It is 20.7 inches long and 13broad, and has ivory runners, with three wooden slats across them,held down by a low wooden rail on each side. Each runner is a slicefrom a single large walrus tusk, with the butt at the back of thesled. The slats, which are pieces of a ship’s paneling, are lashed tothe upper edge of the runners so as to project about one-half inch oneach side. The rails flare slightly outward. The whole is fastenedtogether by lashings of rather broad whalebone, passing through a holenear the upper edge of the runner, a notch in the end of the slat anda hole in the slat inside of the rail. There are two lashings at eachend of each broad slat and one in the middle, at each end of thenarrow one. The last and the ones at each end of the sled also securethe rail by passing through a hole near its edge, in which are cutsquare notches to make room for the other lashings. The trace is astrip of seal thong about 5 feet long and one-fourth inch wide, splitat one end for about 1 foot into two parts. The other end is slit intwo for about 3 inches. This is probably a broken loop, which servedfor fastening the trace to a dog’s harness.I do not recollect ever seeing so small a sled in actual use, thoughLieut. Ray says he has frequently seen them drawn by one dog. Thepeople who came down from Nuwŭk with a small load of things for tradesometimes used a small unía about 3 feet long, with one dog, and thesame was often used by the girls for bringing in firewood from thebeach.A very peculiar sled was formerly used at Point Barrow, but we have nomeans of knowing how common it was. It was a sort of toboggan, made bylashing together lengthwise slabs of whalebone, but is now whollyobsolete, since whalebone has too high a market value to permit of itsbeing used for any such purpose. We obtained one specimen about 10feet long, but it was unfortunately in such a dilapidated conditionthat we were unable to bring it home. I find no previous mention ofthe use of such sleds by any Eskimo. It is not necessary to supposethat this sled is modeled after the toboggan of the Hudson Bayvoyagers, of which these people might have obtained knowledge throughthe eastern natives, since the simple act of dragging home a “slab” ofwhalebone would naturally suggest this contrivance.We did bring home one small sled of this kind (No. 89875 [772], Fig.359, from Utkiavwĭñ), which from its size was probably a child’s toy,though from its greasy condition it seems to have been used fordragging pieces of blubber. It is made of the tips of 6 small “slabs”of black whalebone, each about 2 inches wide at the broad end, and puttogether side by side so as to form a triangle 19¼ inches long and 9¾wide, the apex being the front of the sled, and the left-hand edge ofeach slab slightly overlapping the edge of the preceding. They arefastened together by three transverse bands, passing through loops inthe upper surface of each slot, made by cutting two parallellongitudinal slits about one-half inch long and one-fourth inch apartpart way through, and raising up the surface between them. Thehindmost band is a strip of whalebone nearly one-half inch wide,passing through these loops, and wound closely in a spiral around astraight rod of whalebone, 0.4 inch wide and 0.1 inch thick, as longas the band. The ends of the band are knotted into rings or becketsabout 2¼ inches in diameter. The other two bands are simple, narrowstrips of whalebone, running straight across through the loops andknotted at the ends into similar beckets. These beckets were obviouslyfor tying on the load.The sled with side rails does not appear to be used east of theMackenzie region, but is found only slightly modified at least as farsouth as Norton Sound.[N472] The sledge used on the Asiatic coast,however, as shown in Nordenskiöld’s figure,[N473] belongs to a totallydifferent family, being undoubtedly borrowed from the reindeerChukches.[N474] The sleds of the eastern Eskimo vary somewhat inpattern and material, but may be described in general terms asessentially the same as the unía, but usually provided with what iscalled an “upstander,” namely, two upright posts at each side of theback of the sled, often connected by a cross rail, which serve toguide the sled from behind. Many descriptions and figures of thesesleds will be found in the various descriptions of the eastern Eskimo.    [Footnote N472: See Dall’s figure, Alaska, p. 165.]    [Footnote N473: Vega, vol. 1, p. 498.]    [Footnote N474: Compare also the various illustrations in Hooper’s    “Tents of the Tuski.”·]  [Illustration: FIG. 359.--Small toboggan of whalebone. 1/6]_Dogs and harness._--These sledges are drawn by dogs, which, as far asI am able to judge, are of the same breed as those used by the easternEskimo. They are, as a rule, rather large and stout. A number of thedogs at Utkiavwĭñ would compare favorably in size with the averageNewfoundland dogs, and they appear to be capable of well sustainedexertion. The commonest color is the regular “brindle” of the wolf,though white, brindle-and-white, and black-and-white dogs are notuncommon. There was, however, but one wholly black dog in the twovillages. This was a very handsome animal known by the name of Allúa(“coal”).Every dog has his name and knows it. Their disposition is ratherquarrelsome, especially among themselves, but they are notparticularly ferocious, seldom doing more than howl and yelp at astranger, and it is not difficult usually to make friends with them.There was very little difficulty in petting the half dozen dogs whichwe had at the station, and they grew to be very much attached to thelaborer who used to feed them. The natives treat their dogs well as arule, seldom beating them wantonly or severely. Though they do notallow them to come into the houses, the dogs seem to have considerableattachment to their masters. Considerable care is bestowed on thepuppies. Those born in winter are frequently reared in the iglu, andthe women often carry a young puppy around in the jacket as they woulda child.We saw no traces of the disease resembling hydrophobia, which haswrought such havoc in Greenland and Baffin Land. I once, however, sawa puppy apparently suffering from fits of some kind, running wildlyround and round, yelping furiously, and occasionally rolling over andkicking. The natives said, “Mûlukû´lĭrua, asi´rua”, (“He ishowling[?];[N475] he is bad”), and some of the boys finally took itout on the tundra and knocked it on the head.    [Footnote N475: I failed to get the translation of this word, but    it seems to be connected with the Greenlandic mâlavok, he howls    (a dog--).]The dog harness, ánun (Gr. anut), consists of a broad strip of stoutrawhide (from the bearded seal or walrus), with three parallel loopsat one end, frequently made by simply cutting long slits side by sidein the thong and bending it into shape. The head is passed through themiddle loop and a foreleg through each of the side-loops, bringing themain part of the thong over the back. This serves as a trace, and isfurnished at the end with a toggle of bone or wood, by which it isfastened to beckets in a long line of thong, the end of which isusually made fast to the middle of the first slat of the sledge. Thedogs are attached in a long line, alternately on opposite sides ofthis trace, just so far apart that one dog can not reach his leaderwhen both are pulling.The most spirited dog is usually put at the head of the line asleader, and the natives sometimes select a bitch in heat for thisposition, as the dogs are sure to follow her. The same custom has beenobserved by Kumlien at Cumberland Gulf.[N476] Ten dogs are considereda large team, and few of the natives can muster so many. When thesledge is heavily loaded men and women frequently help to drag it. Thedogs are never _driven_, and except over a well known trail, like thatbetween Utkiavwĭñ and the whaling camp in 1883, will not travel unlessa woman trots along in front, encouraging them with cries of “Añ! añ!tû´lla! tû´lla!” (Come! come on!), while the man or woman who runsbehind the sled to guide it and keep it from capsizing, urges them onwith cries of “Kŭ! kŭ!” (Get on! get on!), occasionally reproving anindividual dog by name. After they are well started, they go onwithout much urging if nothing distracts their attention. It is noteasy to stop a dog team when the destination is reached. Commands andshouts of “Lie down!” are seldom sufficient, and the people generallyhave to pull back on the sled and drag back on the harness till theteam comes to a halt.    [Footnote N476: Contributions, p. 51.]The leader, who is usually a woman or child sometimes guides the teamby a line attached to the trace, and Lieut. Ray says he has seen them,when traveling in the interior, tie a piece of blubber or meat on theend of a string and drag it on the snow just ahead of the leader. Thenatives seldom ride on the sledge except with a light load on a smoothroad. A few old and decrepit people like Yû´ksĭña always traveled onsledges between the villages, and the people who came down with emptysledges for provisions from the whaling camp, always rode on the wellbeaten trail where the dogs would run without leading.[N477] The dogwhip so universally employed by the eastern Eskimo, is not used atPoint Barrow, but when Lieut. Ray made a whip for driving his team,the natives called it ĭpirau´ta, a name essentially identical withthat used in the east. They especially distinguished ĭpirau´ta, a whipwith a lash, from a cudgel, anau´ta. The latter word has also the samemeaning in the eastern dialects.    [Footnote N477: Compare Dall, Alaska, p. 25.]We saw nothing of the custom of protecting the dogs’ feet withsealskin shoes, so prevalent on the Siberian coast.[N478] Curiouslyenough the only other localities in which the use of this contrivanceis mentioned are in the extreme east.[N479] During the first warmweather in the spring, before the dogs have shed their heavy wintercoats, they suffer a great deal from the heat and can go only a shortdistance without lying down to rest.    [Footnote N478: See Hooper, Tents, etc., p. 195, and Nordenskiöld,    Vega, vol. 2, p. 96, where one of these shoes is figured.]    [Footnote N479: See Kumlien, Contributions, p. 42.]The method of harnessing and driving the dogs varies considerably indifferent localities. Among the eastern natives the dogs are usuallyharnessed abreast, each with a separate trace running to the sledge,and the driver generally rides, guiding the dogs with a whip. Theleader usually has a longer trace than the rest. The harness used atFury and Hecla Straits is precisely the same as that at Point Barrow,but in Greenland, according to Dr. Kane, it consists of a “simplebreast-strap,” with a single trace. The illustration, however, inRink’s Tales and Traditions, opposite p. 232, which was drawn by anative Greenlander, shows a pattern of harness similar to that used inSiberia and described by Nordenskiöld[N480] as “made of inch-widestraps of skin, forming a neck or shoulder band, united on both sidesby a strap to a girth, to one side of which the draft strap isfastened.” It is a curious fact that the two extremes of the Eskimorace (for even if the people of Pitlekaj be Chukchi in blood, they areEskimo in culture) should use the same pattern of harness, while adifferent form prevails between them. The Siberians also habituallyride upon the sledges, and use a whip, and on some parts of the coast,at least, harness the dogs abreast. In the region about Pitlekaj,however, the dogs are harnessed “tandem” in pairs, as is the case atNorton Sound, where a more efficient harness is also used, which isprobably not Eskimo, but learned from the whites.[N481]Nordenskiöld[N482] expresses the opinion that the Eskimo method ofharnessing the dogs abreast indicates that the Eskimos have livedlonger than the Chukchis north of the limit of trees; in other words,that the method of harnessing the dogs tandem is the older one, andthat the Eskimo have learned to harness them abreast since they leftthe woodland regions. I can hardly agree with these conclusions, forit seems to me that the easiest and most natural method of attachingthe dogs would be to fasten each directly to the sled by its owntrace. Now, when many dogs are attached to the sled in this way, theouter dogs can not apply their strength in a direct line but must pullobliquely, and, moreover, as we know to be the case, so many longtraces are constantly becoming entangled, and each individual dog hasto be kept straight by the driver. If, however, the dogs be made fastto a long line, one behind the other, not only does each pull straightahead, but if the leader be kept to the track he pulls the other dogsafter him, relieving the driver of the greater part of the care ofthem.    [Footnote N480: Vega, vol. 2; p. 95.]    [Footnote N481: See Dall, Alaska, pp. 163 and 166.]    [Footnote N482: Vega, vol. 2, p. 95, foot note.]It seems to me therefore, that the tandem method is an improvement indog harnessing, which has been adopted only by the natives ofnortheastern Siberia, and northwestern America, and has no connectionwith the wooded or unwooded state of the country.[N483]    [Footnote N483: For descriptions of the sledges and methods of    harnessing used by the eastern Eskimo, see Bessel’s Naturalist,    vol. 18, pt. 9, p. 868, figs. 4 and 5 (Smith Sound); Kane, 2d    Grinnell Exp., vol. 1, p. 205 (Smith Sound) and first Grinnell    Exp., p. 443 (Greenland); Kumlien, Contributions, p. 42, and Boas,    “Central Eskimo,” pp. 529-538 (Cumberland Gulf); Parry, 2d voyage,    p. 514, and Lyon, Journal, p. 235 (Iglulik); Gilder, Schwatka’s    Search, pp. 50, 52, and 66, and Schwatka’s “Nimrod in the North,”    pp. 152, 153 (NW. shore of Hudson Bay and King Williams Land).]HUNTING SCORES.The only thing that we saw of the nature of numerical records were theseries of animals engraved upon ivory, already alluded to. In mostcases we were unable to learn whether the figures really representedan actual record or not, though the bag handle, No. 89424 [890]already figured, was said to contain the actual score of whales killedby old Yú´ksĭña. The custom does not appear to be so prevalent as atNorton Sound (see above, p. 117). Many of these possible scores beingengraved on ivory implements have already been described. With oneexception they only record the capture of whales or reindeer. Theexception (No. 89425 [1732], Fig. 153_b_) presents a series of tenbearded seals. The reindeer are usually depicted in a naturalattitude, and some of the circumstances of the hunt are usuallyrepresented. For instance, a man is figured aiming with a bow andarrow toward a line of reindeer, indicating that such a number weretaken by shooting, while a string of deer, represented without legs asthey would appear swimming, followed by a rude figure of a man in akaiak, means that so many were lanced in the water. Other incidents ofthe excursion are also sometimes represented. On these records thewhale is always represented by a rude figure of the tail cut off atthe “small,” and often represented as hanging from a horizontal line.  [Illustration: FIG. 360.--Hunting score engraved on ivory.]We also brought home four engraved pieces of ivory, which are nothingelse than records of real or imaginary scenes. I have figured all ofthese. Fig. 360 (No. 89487 [1026] from Nuwŭk) is a narrow flat tabletof ivory, 4.8 inches long and 1 inch wide, with a string at one end tohang it up by. On each face is an ornamental border inclosing a numberof incised figures, which probably represent actual scenes, as thetablet is not new.The figures on the obverse face are colored with red ocher. At theupper end, standing on a cross line, with his head toward the end, isa rudely drawn man, holding his right hand up and his left down, withthe fingers outspread. At his left stands a boy with both hands down.These figures probably represent the hunter and his son. Just belowthe cross line is a man raising a spear to strike an animal which isperhaps meant for a reindeer without horns. Three deer, also withouthorns, stand with their feet on one border with their heads toward theupper end, and on the other border near the other end are two buckswith large antlers heading the other way, and behind them a man in akaiak. Between him and the animal which the first man is spearing isan object which may represent the crescent moon. The story may perhapsbe freely translated as follows: “When the moon was young the man andhis son killed six reindeer, two of them bucks with large antlers. Onethey speared on land, the rest they chased with the kaiak.”On the reverse the figures and border are colored black with soot. Inthe left-hand lower corner is a she bear and her cub heading to theleft, followed by a man who is about to shoot an arrow at them. Thencome two more bears heading toward the right, and in the right-handlower corner is a whale with two floats attached to him by a harpoonline. Above this is an umiak with four men in it approaching anotherwhale which has already received one harpoon with its two floats. Theharpoon which is to be thrust at him may be seen sticking out over thebow of the boat. Then come two whales in a line, one heading to theleft and one to the right. In the left-hand upper corner is a figurewhich may represent a boat, bottom up, on the staging of four posts.We did not learn the actual history of this tablet, which was broughtdown for sale with a number of other things.Fig. 361 (No. 89473 [1349] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a piece of an oldsnow-shovel edge with freshly incised figures on both faces, which theartist said represented his own record. The figures are all coloredwith red ocher. On the obverse the figures all stand on a roughlydrawn ground line. At the left is a man pointing his rifle at a bear,which stands on its hind legs facing him. Then comes a she bearwalking toward the left followed by a cub, then two large bears alsowalking to the left, and a she bear in the same attitude, followed bytwo cubs, one behind the other. This was explained by the artist asfollows: “These are all the bears I have killed. This one alone(pointing to the ‘rampant’ one) was bad. All the others were good.” Weheard at the time of his giving the death shot to the last bear as itwas charging his comrade, who had wounded it with his muzzle-loader.On the reverse, the figures are in the same position. The same manpoints his rifle at a string of three wolves. His explanation was:“These are the wolves I have killed.”  [Illustration: FIG. 361.--Hunting score engraved on ivory, obverse  and reverse. 1/3]  [Illustration: FIG. 362.--Hunting score engraved on ivory. 1/3]Fig. 362 (No. 89474 [1334] from Utkiavwĭñ) is newly made, but was saidto be the record of a man of our acquaintance named Mûñĭñolu. It is aflat piece of the outside of a walrus tusk 9.7 inches long and 1.8wide at the broader end. The figures are incised on one face only, andcolored with red ocher. The face is divided lengthwise into two panelsby a horizontal line. In the upper panel, at the left, is a man facingto the right and pointing a gun at a line of three standing deer,facing toward the left. Two are bucks and one a doe. Then come twobucks, represented without legs, as if swimming in the water, followedby a rude figure of a man in a kaiak. Below the line at the left is anumiak with five men, and then a row of twelve conventionalized whales’tails, of which all but the first, second, and fifth are joined to thehorizontal line by a short straight line. The record may be freelytranslated as follows: “I went out with my gun and killed three largereindeer, two bucks and a doe. I also speared two large bucks in thewater. My whaling crew have taken twelve whales.” The number of whalesis open to suspicion, as they just fill up the board.  [Illustration: FIG. 363.--Hunting score engraved on ivory, obverse  and reverse.]Fig. 363 (No. 56517 [121] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a piece of an oldsnow-shovel edge 4.2 inches long, with a loop of thong at the upperside to hang it up by. It is covered on both faces with freshlyincised figures, colored with red ocher, representing some real orimaginary occurrence.The obverse is bordered with a single narrow line. At the left is aman standing with arms outstretched supporting himself by two slenderstaffs as long as he is. In the middle are three rude figures oftents, very high and slender. At the right is a hornless reindeerheading to the left, with a man standing on its back with his legsstraddled apart and his arms uplifted. On the reverse, there is noborder, but a single dog and a man who supports himself with a longstaff are dragging an empty rail sledge toward the left.I find no mention of the use of any such scores among the easternEskimo, but they are very common among those of the west, as shown bythe Museum collections. They record in this way, not only huntingexploits but all sorts of trivial occurrences.GAMES AND PASTIMES._Gambling._--These people have only one game which appears to be ofthe nature of gambling. It is played with the twisters and marlinespikes used for backing the bow, and already described, though Lieut.Ray says he has seen it played with any bits of stick or bone. I neverhad an opportunity of watching a game of this sort played, as it isnot often played at the village. It is a very popular amusement at thedeer-hunting camps, where Lieut. Ray often saw it played. According tohim the players are divided into sides, who sit on the ground about 3yards apart, each side sticking up one of the marline spikes for amark to throw the twisters at. Six of the latter, he believes, make afull set. One side tosses the whole set one at a time at the oppositestake, and the points which they make are counted up by theiropponents from the position of the twisters as they fall. He did notlearn how the points were reckoned, except that twisters with a markon them counted differently from the plain ones, or how long the gamelasted, each side taking its turn of casting at the opposite stake.He, however, got the impression that the winning side kept thetwisters belonging to their opponents. Mr. Nelson informs me in aletter that a similar game is played with the same implements atNorton Sound.No. 56532 [9], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a bag full of these tools as usedfor playing this game. It contains 18 twisters, of different patterns,and 7 marline spikes. The bag is of membrane, perhaps a bladder. It isovoid in shape, all in one piece, with a long opening in one side,which is closed by a piece of sinew braid about 40 inches long. Thisis knotted by one end round a fold of membrane at one end of themouth, and when the bag is shut up is wrapped round the middle of it.Some of these people have learned what cards are from the Nunatañmiun,though they do not know how to use them. They described how they wereused by the “Nunatañmiun,” however, going through the motions ofdealing cards. They told us that the latter played a great deal, and“gave much.” This “giving much” evidently referred to gambling, forthey told Capt. Herendeen how two of the “Nunatañmiun” would sit downto play, one with a big pile of furs and one without any, and whenthey got up the furs would all belong to the other man.Fig. 364 (No. 56531 [21]) represents some of a bunch of 25 littleivory images which were strung on a bit of seal thong. One is a neatlycarved fox, 2.7 inches long, and the rest are ducks or geese, ratherroughly carved, with flat bellies. The largest of these is 1.3 incheslong and the smallest 0.8 inch. These were purchased at Plover Bay,eastern Siberia, during our brief visit in August, 1881, and weresupposed to be merely works of art. I was, however, very muchinterested on my return to Washington to find that Dr. Franz Boas hadbrought from Cumberland Gulf a number of precisely similar images,which are there used for playing a game of the nature of “jackstones.”The player tosses up a handful of these images, and scores points forthe number that sit upright when they fall.[N484] It is thereforequite likely that they are used for a similar purpose at Plover Bay.If this be so, it is a remarkable point of similarity between thesewidely separated Eskimo, for I can learn nothing of a similar customat any intermediate point.    [Footnote N484: This game is briefly referred to by Hall, Arctic    Researches, p. 570.]  [Illustration: FIG. 364.--Game of fox and geese, from Plover Bay.]  [Illustration: FIG. 365.--Dancing cap. 1/4]_Festivals._--The most important festivals are apparentlysemireligious in character and partake strongly of the nature ofdramatic representations. At these festivals they make use of manyarticles of dress and adornment, not worn on other occasions, and evensome “properties” and mechanical contrivances to add to the dramaticeffect. All festivals are accompanied by singing, drumming, anddancing.At the formal festivals, in the early winter, the performers aredressed in new deerskin clothing, with the snow-white flesh sideoutward, and in certain parts of the performance wear on their headstall conical caps covered with rows of mountain sheep teeth whichrattle as the wearer dances.We brought home one of these dancing caps (kă´brû, käluka´) (No. 89820[863] Fig. 365), made of deerskin with the hair inward and clippedclose. The outside is painted all over with red ocher. The front isnearly all in one piece, but the back is irregularly pieced and gored.It is surmounted by a thick tuft of brown and white wolverine furabout 5 inches long, sewed into the apex. To the middle of one side atthe edge is sewed a narrow strip of deerskin with the hair clippedclose, which is long enough to go under the wearer’s chin and beknotted into a slit close to the edge of the other side of the cap. Onthe front edge is sewed a row of thirty-five incisor teeth of themountain sheep by a thread running through a hole drilled through theroot of each.The series is regularly graduated, having the largest teeth in themiddle and the smallest on the ends. Above this is a narrow strip ofbrown deerskin running two-thirds round the cap and sewed on fleshside out so that the hair projects as a fringe below. Above this arethree ornamental bands about 2 inches apart running two-thirds roundthe cap, each fringed on the lower edge with sheep teeth strung as onthe edge of the cap. The lower row contains 54 teeth, the middle 29,and the upper 31. The lowest band is made of 2 strips of mountainsheepskin with a narrow strip of black sealskin between them, and anarrow strip of brown deerskin with the hair out; the next is ofcoarse gray deerskin with the hair out; and the uppermost of browndeerskin with the flesh side out. The cap is old and dirty, and hasbeen long in use.  [Illustration: FIG. 366.--Wooden mask. 1/4]The custom of wearing this style of cap appears to be peculiar to thenorthwestern Eskimo, as I find no mention for it elsewhere. It isperhaps derived indirectly from the northern Indians, some of whom arerepresented as wearing a similar headdress.In certain parts of the same ceremony as witnessed by Lieut. Ray thedancers also wore rattle mittens, which were shaken in time to themusic. A pair of these were offered for sale once, but Lieut. Ray didnot consider them sufficiently of pure Eskimo manufacture to be worththe price asked for them. They were made of sealskin and covered allover the back with empty Winchester cartridge shells loosely attachedby a string through a hole in the bottom, so as to strike against eachother when the mitten was shaken. The five men who wore these mittenswore on their heads the stuffed skins of various animals, the wolf,bear, fox, lynx, and dog, which they were supposed to represent. Thesearticles were never offered for sale, as they were probably too highlyvalued.We collected twelve wooden masks, which we were told were worn in someof these ceremonies, though none of our party ever witnessed anyperformance in which they were used. Some of them are of undoubtedage. No. 56499 [6] (Fig. 366) has been selected as the type of thesemasks (ki´nau, from ki´na, face). This is a rather good representationof a male human face, 8.8 inches long and 5.8 wide. It is quitesmoothly carved out of cottonwood, and the back is neatly hollowedout, being more deeply excavated round the eyes and mouth and insideof the nose. The mouth is represented as wide open, showing the tip ofthe tongue attached to the underlip, and has six small teeth whichlook like dog’s incisors inserted in a row in the middle of the upperlip. The eyebrows and moustache are marked out with blacklead, andthere are traces of red ocher on the cheeks. The holes for the stringsare in the edge about on a level with the eyes. One end of a string ofseal thong long enough to go around the wearer’s head is passed outthrough the hole on the right side, slit close to the tip, and theother end passed through this. The other end is passed out through thehole on the left and made fast with two half hitches. A row of smallholes round the edge of the mask shows where a hood has been tackedon. This mask is rather old and somewhat soiled.  [Illustration: FIG. 367.--Wooden mask and dancing gorget. 1/4]A very old weathered mask (No. 56497 [235] from Utkiavwĭñ), 7.8 incheslong, and made of soft wood, apparently pine, is similar to thepreceding, but has no tongue, and the teeth in both jaws arerepresented as a continuous ridge. It has an “imperial” as well as amoustache, marked with blacklead like the eyebrows. The cheeks arecolored with red ocher. The edge is much gapped and broken, but showsthe remains of a deep narrow groove running round on the outside about¼ inch from the edge, and pierced with small holes for fastening on ahood.Figure 367 (No. 89817 [856] also from Utkiavwĭñ) is a mask much likethe preceding, 7.5 inches long, and made of spruce. It is peculiar inhaving the outer corners of the eyes rather depressed, and in additionto the moustache and imperial has a broad “whaleman’s mark” drawn withblack lead across the eyes. It is grooved round the edge for fasteningon a hood. The lower part of the face has been split off at thecorners of the mouth and mended on with two stitches of whalebone, anda piece which was broken out at the left-hand corner of the mouth issecured by a wooden peg at the inner edge and a stitch of whalebone onthe lower side. This mask has been for a long time fastened to anornamented wooden gorget, and appeared to have been exposed to theweather, perhaps at the cemetery. The string is made of unusuallystout sinew braid.  [Illustration: FIG. 368.--Old grotesque mask. 1/4]The remaining four ancient human masks are all masculine, and only onehas any indication of labrets. On this mask, No. 89812 [1063], thereare two small holes in the position of the labrets. It is probablethat the wearers of these masks are supposed to represent the ancientEskimo, who wore no labrets. A mask which was carelessly made for sale(No. 89814 [1056] from Utkiavwĭñ), however, has large plug-labretscarved out. Though roughly carved this mask is a very characteristicEskimo face, and would almost pass as the portrait of a man of ouracquaintance in Utkiavwĭñ. The two little roughly carved human faceson the top of this mask are probably merely for ornament. No suchthings are to be seen on any of the old masks which have been actuallyused. This mask seems to have been whittled out of the bottom of anold meat tray, and has a string of whalebone. Most of the genuinemasks are of excellent workmanship, but two are quite roughly carved.One of these especially is such a bungling piece of work that it wouldbe set down as commercial were it not weathered and evidently old. Thepainting never goes farther than marking out the beard and eyebrowswith soot or black lead, and sometimes reddening the cheeks withocher. Fig. 368 (No. 89816 [1583] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a very old maskof cottonwood, blackened with age and so rudely carved that the workwas probably done with a stone tool. It is grooved around the edge forfastening on a hood and is 6.8 inches long.The only female human masks seen are new and made for sale. One ofthese (No. 89819 [1057], Fig. 369, from Utkiavwĭñ) is roughly whittledfrom the bottom of an old meat tray, and has the hair, eyebrows, and asingle line of tattooing on the chin painted with soot. It is 8.7inches long and has strings of whalebone.Another (No. 56498 [73] from Utkiavwĭñ) is about the size of thecommon masks and tolerably well made. It has the hair and eyebrowsmarked with black lead. The last is a foot long, and like the onefigured is roughly whittled out of the bottom of an old meat tray. Ithas the hair, eyebrows, and a single stripe of tattooing on the chinmarked with black lead. This came from Utkiavwĭñ (No. 89811 [1037]).  [Illustration: FIG. 369.--Rude mask of wood. 1/4]Another “commercial” mask (No. 89813 [1074] from Utkiavwĭñ) is veryelaborate, but roughly and carelessly made. It is almost flat, withthe features hardly raised in relief. In each corner of the mouth isinserted a slender ivory tusk about 1 inch long, and besides theeyebrows, moustache, and imperial, there is a broad “whaleman’s mark”running obliquely across the right cheek from the bridge of the nose.Six long feathers are stuck in the edge of the forehead. Curiouslyenough these are the feathers of the South American ostrich, and camefrom the feather duster in use at our station.Fig. 370 (No. 56496 [258] from Utkiavwĭñ) represents, rather rudely,a wolf’s face and ears, and is the only animal mask we obtained orsaw. It is of cottonwood, old and weathered, and is 4.7 inches longand 6.5 wide. It is painted on the edge with red ocher and has astreak of the same color down the ridge of the nose. The string is ofwhalebone and unbraided sinew pieced together.  [Illustration: FIG. 370.--Wolf mask of wood. 1/4]  [Illustration: FIG. 371.--Very ancient small mask. 1/4]Fig. 371 (No. 89815 [1050] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a mask that seems almosttoo small to have been worn, being only 6.1 inches long and 4.7 wide.It is very old, made of blackened cottonwood, and is the rudestrepresentation of the human face which we saw. It is simply an ovaldisk, concavo-convex, with holes cut for the eyes, nostrils, andmouth. The rough cutting about the chin appears to have been done witha stone tool, and the mouth seems to be smeared with blood. The stringpassed through the holes in the forehead to hang it up by is muchnewer than the mask, being braided from cotton twine and fastened to acommon galvanized boat nail.The more southern Eskimo of Alaska are in the habit of using in theirdances very elaborate and highly ornamented and painted masks, ofwhich the National Museum possesses a very large collection. Theancient Aleuts also used masks.[N485] On the other hand, no otherEskimo, save those of Alaska, ever use masks in their performances, asfar as I can learn, with the solitary exception of the people ofBaffin Land, where a mask of the hide of the bearded seal is worn oncertain occasions.[N486] Nordenskiöld saw one wooden mask among thepeople near the _Vega’s_ winter quarters, but learned that this hadbeen brought from Bering Strait, and probably from America.[N487]    [Footnote N485: See Dall, Alaska, p. 389, and contributions to    N. A. Ethn., vol. 1, p. 90.]    [Footnote N486: See Kumlien, Contributions, p. 43. Kumlien says    merely “a mask of skins.” Dr. Boas is my authority for the    statement that the skin of the bearded seal is used.]    [Footnote N487: Vega, vol. 2, p. 21.]The masks appear to become more numerous and more elaborate the nearerwe get to the part of Alaska inhabited by the Indians of the T’linketstock, who, as is well known employ, in their ceremonies remarkablyelaborate wooden masks and headdresses. It may be suggested that thiscustom of using masks came from the influence of these Indians,reaching in the simple form already described as far as Point Barrow,but not beyond.[N488] With these masks was worn a gorget orbreast-plate, consisting of a half-moon shaped piece of board about 18inches long, painted with rude figures of men and animals, and slungabout the neck. We brought home three of these gorgets, all old andweathered.    [Footnote N488: See also Dall’s paper in the Third Annual Report    of the Bureau of Ethnology, pp. 67-203, where the subject of    mask-wearing is very thoroughly discussed in its most important    relations.]No. 89818 [1132], Fig. 372_a_, has been selected as the type of thegorget (sûkĭmûñ). It is made of spruce, is 18.5 inches long, and hastwo beckets of stout sinew braid, one to go round the neck and theother round the body under the wearer’s arms. The figures are allpainted on the front face. In the middle is a man painted with redocher; all the rest of the figures are black and probably painted withsoot. The man with his arms outstretched stands on a large whale,represented as spouting. He holds a small whale in each hand. At hisright is a small cross-shaped object which perhaps represents a bird,then a man facing toward the left and darting a harpoon with bothhands, and a bear facing to the left. On the left of the red man aretwo umiaks with five men in each, a whale nearly effaced, and three ofthe cross-shaped objects already mentioned. Below them, also, freshlydrawn with a hard, blunt lead pencil or the point of a bullet, are awhale, an umiak, and a three-cornered object the nature of which I cannot make out.Fig. 372_b_ (No. 56493 [266] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a similar gorget,which has evidently been long exposed to the weather, perhaps at thecemetery, as the figures are all effaced except in the middle, whereit was probably covered by a mask as in Fig. 367 (No. 89817 [855] fromthe same village). There seems to have been a red border on theserrated edge. In the middle is the same red man as before standing onthe black whale and holding a whale in each hand. At his right is ablack umiak with five men in it, and at his left a partially effacedfigure which is perhaps another boat. The strings are put on asbefore, except that the two beckets are separate. The upper is made ofsinew braid, and the lower, which is now broken, of seal thong. Thisgorget is 15.5 inches long and 4.7 wide. No. 89817 [855] (Fig. 367already referred to) has a mask tied over the middle by means of thebeckets, so that the figures in the middle are much fresher than thoseon the ends. The edges are painted red. In the middle is the same redman or giant holding the whale. The other figures are painted withsoot.  [Illustration: FIG. 372.--Dancing gorgets of wood. 1/4]This man or giant, able to hold out a whale, appears to be a legendarycharacter, as we have his image carved in ivory. We unfortunately didnot succeed in learning anything more about him, except that his name(apparently) was “kikámigo.” Hanging by the head to each elbow of thisfigure is a seal, and opposite its thighs two of the usualconventional whale’s tails, one on each side, with the flukes turnedfrom him. The one on his left is attached to his waist by a straightline from its upper corner. At its right hand are a number of objectsirregularly grouped. At the top an umiak with five men towing at athree-cornered object, which probably represents a dead whale; then asmaller umiak containing five men and apparently “fast” to a whale,which is spouting. A figure above this, almost obliterated, appears tobe a small whale. Below are a large seal, three of the cross-shapedfigures, four small whales, and one figure so much effaced that it cannot be made out. On the left hand of the figure are two umiaks, and awhale with a line and float attached to him, then four crosses and alarge seal in the corner. Below are four whales of different sizes,two bears, and a dog or wolf.These gorgets appear to have gone out of fashion, as we saw none whichwere not very old, or which appeared to have been used recently. Fromthe nature of the figures upon them, they were probably used in someof the ceremonies connected with the whale fishing. Kika´mĭgo may bethe “divinity” who controls the whales and other sea animals.[N489]    [Footnote N489: Cf. Crantz, vol. 1, p. 206.]_Mechanical contrivances._--In one of the performances which Capt.Herendeen witnessed, there stood in the middle of the floor facingeach other, the stuffed skins of a fox and a raven. These were mountedon whalebone springs and moved by strings, so that the fox sprang atthe raven and the raven pecked at the fox, while the singing anddancing went on. These animals were never offered for sale, but theybrought over a stuffed fox very cleverly mounted so as to spring at alemming, which by means of strings was made to run in and out of twoholes in the board on which the fox was mounted. (No. 89893 [1378]from Utkiavwĭñ.) We unfortunately did not learn the story or mythconnected with this representation.[N490] It was the skin of an Arcticfox in the summer pelage, with the paws and all the bones removed, andclumsily stuffed with rope yarn, not filling out the legs. A stick wasthrust into the tail to within about two inches of the tip, so that itwas curled up over the back. The skin was taken off whole by a singleopening near the vent, which was left open, and through which wasthrust into the body a strip of whalebone 2 inches wide and about ⅛inch thick, which protruded about 4¼ inches and was fastened to thefront edge of the hole by tying the flap of skin to the whalebone withthree or four turns of sinew braid, kept from slipping by a notch ineach edge of the whalebone.    [Footnote N490: This very interesting specimen was unfortunately    destroyed by moths at the National Museum after the description    was written, but before it could be figured.]The fox was attached to a piece of the paneling of a ship’s bulkhead,29 inches long and 7.5 wide, by bending forward 2¾ inches of the endof the whalebone, and lashing it down parallel to the length of theboard with four turns of stout thong, kept from slipping by a notch ineach edge of the whalebone and running through holes in the board. Thefox was thus held up by the spring parallel to the length of the boardwith its head and forelegs raised. A string of sinew braid 10 feetlong was passed through a hole in the septum of the fox’s nose andknotted once so as to leave two equal ends. These ends were carrieddown through two holes, one in each edge of the board 9½ inches fromthe forward end, and each was tied to a roughly-rounded bit of pinestick round which it was reeled when not in use. By pulling thesestrings together, the fox was made to dart down his head, which wasraised by the spring as soon as the string was slackened. By pullingone or the other string the fox could be made to dart to one or theother side of the board.One man manipulated the fox, pulling a string with each hand. Thelemming’s holes were about 1¼ inches in diameter, one in each edge ofthe board and at such a distance from the end that when the string,which was 7 feet 4 inches long, was drawn through them, it crossed theboard just where the fox’s nose struck, when it was pulled down. Theends of the string were reeled round bits of stick. The lemming was anarrow strip of wolf’s fur, about 3 inches long, doubled in themiddle, with the middle of the string hitched into the bight. Bypulling the ends of the string alternately, the lemming was made tojump out of the hole on one side, run across the board and into theother, very much as a live lemming runs from one tunnel to another onthe tundra. It took two persons, one on each side, to handle thelemming. The foxskin and spring appeared to be older than the rest ofthe machine. The board was originally 10 inches or 1 foot longer ateach end, but had to be cut off to pack it.Petroff mentions a similar custom among the “Nushegagmute” of BristolBay, of introducing stuffed animals moved with hidden strings in theirperformances;[N491] and Dall[N492] describes a festival at NortonSound, where a dead seal was brought in and moved about with strings.    [Footnote N491: Report, p. 135.]    [Footnote N492: Alaska, p. 156.]_Description of festivals._--It is greatly to be regretted that we hadnot established such intimate relations with the natives, asafterwards was the case, in the winter of 1881-’82, since this was theonly one of the two seasons that the great winter festival was held atUtkiavwĭñ. In the winter of 1882-’83 there had been so many deaths inthe village that the natives did not feel like celebrating any regularfestival, and only indulged in a few impromptu dances late in theseason. These were unfortunately held in the evening when the writer’stour of duty at the station prevented his witnessing them. Those ofthe party who did go over brought back only fragmentary and rathervague accounts of the performance. The confining nature of the work atthe station prevented our witnessing any of the celebrations at Nuwŭkor at Pernyû, when the “Nunatañmiun” visitors were entertained.The best accounts we have of any performance is given by Lieut. Ray.He and Capt. Herendeen went over to Utkiavwĭñ by special invitation onDecember 3, 1881, and witnessed one scene of the “wood,” or “treedance.” Many visitors were present from Nuwŭk on the occasion of thisdance, which lasted for two days and nights. On arriving at thevillage they found a crowd of upwards of 200 people assembled roundthe entrance of the kû´dyĭgĭ. In front of the entrance were drawn upin line five men and two women dancing to the music of a drum and twosingers.They were all dressed in new deerskin clothes, with the snow-whiteflesh side turned out, and wore conical dance caps like that alreadydescribed. They kept time to the music with their feet, moving theirbodies to right and left with spasmodic jerks. To quote from Lieut.Ray’s MS. notes:  Each dancer in turn sprang to the front and in extravagant gestures  went through the motions of killing seal, walrus, and deer, and the  pursuit of the whale. Each, as he finished, took his place in the  line, was cheered by the crowd, then added his voice to the  monotonous chant of the singers.After all had finished as many as could get in entered the “dancehouse.” At one end of this a small space was partitioned off with apiece of an old sail, and from the roof in the middle hung an objectintended to represent a tree. This was made of two oblong boxes about6 inches in diameter, open at both ends, the lower about 2½ feet longand the upper about 1½, hinged together with seal thong. At one sidehung a wolf’s skull, and on the other a dried raven. Two performerssat in the middle of the floor with their legs extended one betweenthe other’s legs, with his nose touching the tree. A row of old menbeat drums and sang, while the performers chanted a monotonous song,in which could be heard the words “rum, tobacco, seal, deer, andwhale.”Presently the bottom of the curtain was lifted and out crawled fivemen on all fours, wearing on their heads the stuffed skins of theheads of different animals--the wolf, bear, fox, lynx, and dog. Theyswung their heads from side to side in unison, keeping time to themusic, uttering a low growl at each swing and shaking their rattlemittens. This they kept up for fifteen or twenty minutes, while thechant still went on, and the chief performer, with excited gestures,embraced the tree and rubbed his nose against it from time to time. Atlast all “sprang to their feet with a howl, and ended the dance withwild gestures.” Similar scenes, with new performers, which our partydid not stay to witness, succeeded this, with feasting in thedifferent houses.Capt. Herendeen also witnessed a small dance, lasting only oneevening, which bore a curious resemblance to some of the so-called“favor figures” performed in the “German cotillon” of civilizeddancers. This kind of dance was performed purely for pleasure, and hadnothing religious or dramatic about it. The music was furnished by theusual orchestra of old men, who beat drums and sang a monotonous song.Each person who intended to take part in the dance came provided withsome small article to be given away as a “favor,” and rising in histurn, danced a few minutes, and then called out the name of thepartner he wished to give it to. The latter then rose, and havingreceived the “favor,” danced a while with him, and then both resumedtheir places among the spectators.We never heard of any such elaborate “donation parties” as aredescribed at Norton Sound and the Yukon region, where a man “saves uphis property for years” to distribute it among his guests.[N493]A festival, however, was held at Nuwŭk in June, 1883, which apparentlyresembled the second kind described by Dall.[N494] Two men came downfrom Nuwŭk to invite Lieut. Ray and Capt. Herendeen, telling them whatpresents they were expected to bring. Unfortunately it was consideredthat too much was asked and the invitation was declined. Themessengers carried “notched sticks.”[N495]  [Illustration: FIG. 373.--Youth dancing to the aurora.]Dances in which the children only take part, entirely for amusement,sometimes take place in the kû´dyĭgĭ, and people occasionally amusethemselves by dancing in the iglu. I have often seen the natives,especially the children and young people, dancing in the open air, andthe dancing was always of very much the same character. The feet werebut slightly moved, keeping time to the music, while the body swayedgracefully and the arms were waved from side to side. All the dancingwhich I saw was rather quiet and graceful, but they told us that whenthey got warmed up at a great dance they went at it with tremendousvigor, throwing off their garments to the waist. The dance whichaccompanies the song sung by the children to the aurora, however, ismore violent. The dancer clenches his fists and, bending his elbows,strikes them against the sides of his body, keeping time to the songand stamping vigorously with the right foot, springing up and downwith the left knee (see Fig. 373, from a sketch by the writer).We never heard of any of the licentious festivals or orgies describedby Egede[N496] and Kumlien.[N497]    [Footnote N493: See Dall, Alaska, p. 151.]    [Footnote N494: Ibid, p. 154.]    [Footnote N495: Compare the wand “curiously ornamented and carved”    carried by the messenger who was sent out to invite the guests to    the festival at Norton Sound, Alaska, p. 154.]    [Footnote N496: Greenland, p. 139.]    [Footnote N497: Contributions, p. 43.]The festivals of the eastern Eskimo appear to be less formal andelaborate than those in the west, consisting simply of singing anddancing.[N498]    [Footnote N498: Descriptions of Eskimo festivals are to be found    in Egede’s Greenland, p. 152, and Crantz, History of Greenland,    vol. 1, p. 175, where he mentions the sun feast held at the winter    solstice. This very likely corresponds to the December festival at    Point Barrow. If the latter be really a rite instituted by the    ancestors of the present Eskimo when they lived in lower latitudes    to celebrate the winter solstice, it is easy to understand why it    should be held at about the same time by the people of Kotzebue    Sound, as stated by Dr. Simpson, op. cit., p. 262, where, as he    says, the reindeer might be successfully pursued throughout the    winter. It is much more likely, considering the custom in    Greenland, that this is the reason for having the festival at this    season than that the time should be selected by the people at    Point Barrow as a season when “hunting or fishing can not well be    attended to,” as Simpson thinks. We should remember that this is    the very time of the year that the seal netting is at its height    at Point Barrow. See also Parry, Second Voyage, p. 538; Kumlien,    Contributions, p. 43; Gilder, Schwatka’s Search, p. 43; Beechey,    Voyage, p. 288 (Kotzebue Sound); Dall, Alaska, p. 149 (very full    and detailed); Petroff, Report, etc., pp. 125, 126, 129, 131    (quoted from Zagoskin), 135, 137 (quoted from Shelikhof), and 144    (quoted from Davidof); Hooper, Tents, etc., pp. 85, 136; and    Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2, pp. 22, 131.]TOYS AND SPORTS FOR CHILDREN AND OTHERS._Playthings._--Though the children amuse themselves with a great manysports and plays, we saw very few toys or playthings in use. Webrought home six objects which appear to have no use except asplaythings.Fig. 374_a_ (No. 89806 [1189] from Nuwŭk) is a whirligig in principlevery like that made for civilized children. It is a block of spruce,fitted with a shaft of narwhal ivory. This fits loosely in thestraight tubular handle, which is a section of the branch of anantler, with the soft inside tissue cut out. A string of seal thongpasses through a hole in the middle of the handle and is fastened tothe shaft. This string is about 8 feet long, and about half of it istied up into the hank to make a handle for pulling it. It works verymuch like a civilized child’s whirligig. The string is wound aroundthe shaft and a smart pull on the handle unwinds it, making the blockspin round rapidly. The reaction, spinning it in the oppositedirection, winds up the string again. A couple of loose hawk’sfeathers are stuck into the tip of the block, which is painted withred ocher for about an inch. Four equidistant stripes of the samecolor run down the sides to a border of the same width round the base.This was made for sale and appears to be an unusual toy. I do notrecollect ever seeing the children play with such a toy. It is calledkai´psa (Gr. kâvsâk, “a whirligig or similar toy”).Fig. 374_b_ is a similar whirligig from Utkiavwĭñ (No. 89807 [1356]).The block, which is 4.2 inches long, is made of the solid tip of amountain sheep’s horn, and is elaborately ornamented with aconventional pattern of lines and “circles and dots,” incised andcolored red with ocher. The shaft is of hard bone, and the line has alittle wooden handle at the end. The block is so heavy that it willhardly spin.  [Illustration: FIG. 374.--Whirligigs. 3/8]Fig. 375 (No. 56491 [46] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a teetotum (also calledkaipsa). The shaft is of pine and the disk of spruce and is ornamentedwith black lead marks, forming a border about one-quarter inch broadon each face. The upper face is divided into quadrants by four narrowlines radiating from the hole, and each quadrant is divided into twoby bands one-quarter inch broad. The order of these lines is reversedon the under face. This is spun, like a common teetotum, with thefingers, and does not seem to be common. I do not recollect everseeing anyone except the maker of this toy spinning one.  [Illustration: FIG. 375.--Teetotum. 1/8]The same is true of No. 89722 [1087] (Fig. 376, from Utkiavwĭñ) whichis what American boys would call a “buzz” toy. It is of pine wood, andthrough two round holes in the middle are passed the ends of a pieceof stout sinew braid, which are knotted together. When the board isplaced in the middle of the string it can be made to spin round andwhiz by alternately pulling and relaxing the ends of the string. Theboard is rather elaborately painted. One end has a border of blacklead on both faces, the other a similar border of red paint, whichappears to be red lead. Broad red bands form a square 1 inch acrossaround the holes, with lines radiating from each corner to the cornersof the board, on both faces. On the spaces between these lines arefigures rudely drawn with black lead. On one face, in the first space,is a goose; in the second, a man with a staff; in the third, theconventional figure of a whale’s tail; and in the fourth, a whale withline and float attached to him, pursued by a whaling umiak. On theother side, the first space contains a dog or wolf walking; thesecond, two of these animals, sitting on their haunches, facing eachother; the third, another walking; and the fourth, a reindeer in thesame attitude.  [Illustration: FIG. 376.--Buzz toy. 1/2]Fig. 377 (No. 89800 [1331] from Utkiavwĭñ), on the other hand, is atoy which the children often play with. It is the well known“whizzing-stick” found among savages in so many widely distant partsof the world, and often used in religious ceremonies. The Eskimo nameis ĭmĭglúta. It consists of a thin board of pine wood, fastened by astring of sinew braid about 1 foot long to the end of a slender rod,which serves as a handle. When swung rapidly round by the handle itmakes a loud, whizzing sound. It is very neatly made, and painted withblack lead and red ocher. The tips of the board are black for aboutone-half inch and the rest is red, and the upper half of the handlemarked with five rings about one-half inch wide and 1 inch apart,alternately black and red. This appears to be purely a child’s toy andhas no mystical signification. I never saw one in the hands of anadult. This specimen was made and brought over for sale by a lad aboutthirteen or fourteen years old.  [Illustration: FIG. 377.--Whizzing stick.]  [Illustration: FIG. 378.--Pebble snapper.]Fig. 378 (No. 56687 [181] from Utkiavwĭñ) is another plaything rathercommon with the boys, which takes the place of the American boy’s“bean snapper.” It is known by the name of mĭtĭ´glĭgaun, and is a rodof whalebone, stiff and black, 4.8 inches long and 0.5 wide, narrowedand bent sharply up for about an inch at one end. On the upper side ofthis end, close to the tip, is a little hollow, large enough to hold asmall pebble, and the other is cut into sharp teeth. This is purely aninstrument of mischief and is used for shooting tiny pebbles at peoplewhen they are looking the other way. Mûñialu showed us, with greatglee, in an expressive pantomime, how a boy would hit a person in theeye with a little pebble, and, when the man turned round angrily,would have the snapper slipped up his sleeve and be looking earnestlyin another direction. The toothed end, he said, was for mischievouslyscratching hairs out of a man’s coat when he was looking another way.The “snapper” is used as follows: It is held in the left hand,a little pebble is set in the socket, and the tip of the whalebonebent back with the right hand. When this end is let go the elasticityof the whalebone drives the pebble at the mark with considerableforce. As far as I can learn this mischievous toy is peculiar to theNorthwest._Dolls._--Though several dolls and various suits of miniature clothingwere made and brought over for sale, they do not appear to be popularwith the little girls. I do not recollect ever seeing a child playingwith a doll. Those in the collection, indeed, seem rather lessintended for playthings than as, so to speak, works of art to catchthe fancy of the strangers. Such an object is No. 89728 [1304] (Fig.379 from Utkiavwĭñ.) This is a human head carved out of pine wood, andshouldered off at the neck into a stout round peg, which is fittedinto the middle of a thick elliptical pedestal of the same wood, flaton the bottom and convex on top. The head is dressed in a neatly madehood of thin deerskin with the flesh side cut off round the shouldersand exposing only the face. The face is very neatly carved, and hasbits of green oxidized copper inlaid for the eyes. The cheeks, gums,and inside of the mouth are colored with red ocher, and the hair,eyebrows, and beard with black lead. The top of the pedestal ispainted red and divided into eight equal parts by shallow groovescolored with black lead. The height of the whole object is 4½ inches,and the workmanship is remarkably good.  [Illustration: FIG. 379.--Carving of human head.]No. 89827 [1138] (from Utkiavwĭñ), on the other hand, is very roughlyand carelessly made. It is 18.2 inches long, roughly whittled out of aflat piece of redwood board into the shape of a man with his legs wideapart and holding up his hands on each side of his head. The arms arevery short and broad, with five fingers all nearly of the same length,and the legs are simply two straight four-sided pegs rounded on theedges. It is dressed in a hooded frock of seal gut reaching to theknees and leaving only the face and hands uncovered, and has sealskinknee boots on the legs. The face is rudely in relief, with two narrowbits of ivory inlaid for eyes, and a long canine tusk of the samematerial inserted in each corner of the mouth. Three small round bitsof wood are inlaid in the forehead, one in the middle and one overeach eye, and one in the right cheek above the corner of the mouth.The gut frock is carelessly made of irregular pieces. It is trimmedround the bottom and the edge of the hood with a strip of dogskin, butis left with a raw edge round the wrists. The boots are rather wellmade models of the regular waterproof boots, with soles of whitesealskin and a band round the top 1 inch wide of the same material.A short peg projects from the top of the forehead. A string of stoutsinew braid about 2 feet long is passed through a hole in the middleof the body and a knot tied in the end in front. Though the design iselaborate the workmanship is very rude, and the clothes seem to bemade of odds and ends. The maker perhaps had in mind a fabulous manwith teeth like a walrus, about whom we heard some fragmentarytraditions.  [Illustration: FIG. 380.--Mechanical doll: drum player.]Fig. 380 (No. 89826 [1358] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a clever, thoughsomewhat roughly made, mechanical doll. It represents a man dressed indeerskins sitting with his legs outstretched and holding in hisextended left hand a drum and in his right a stick, as if beating thedrum. The arms are of whalebone, and by pressing them he can be madeto beat the drum. The doll is made of a single piece of wood--a knotwith two branches, which make the legs. (I learned this from Capt.Herendeen, who saw this doll at the village before it was finished.)The height of the sitting figure is 11½ inches.  [Illustration: FIG. 381.--Mechanical toy: kaiak paddler.]A still more ingenious mechanical toy which, however, like thepreceding, was made for sale, is shown in Fig. 381 (No. 89855 [1351]from Utkiavwĭñ). This is a man sitting in a kaiak in the attitude ofpaddling on the left side with a single-bladed paddle. His arms are ofwhalebone, and by means of strings he can be made to paddle and turnhis head from side to side. The kaiak is 29 inches long, very neatlycarved from a single block of wood, and solid except at the cockpit.The bottom is flat, to allow it to stand on the floor, but it isotherwise precisely of the model of the kaiaks in the Museum from theMackenzie and Anderson region. The nation who made it called it a“Kûñmû´d’lĭñ” kaiak. It is painted all over with red ocher, except onthe bottom. The figure has no legs and fits into the cockpit, which iswithout any coaming. The head is separate and mounted on a long,slender pivot, which is fitted into a hole in the neck just looselyenough to allow it to turn easily. It is dressed in a hood of sealgut. The face is very natural, though rather rudely carved, and islightly colored all over with red ocher, with the mouth painted deeplyred, and the eyebrows, eyes, nostrils, and beard marked with blacklead. The arms are narrow strips of whalebone, the ends of whichprotrude at the wrists, and are tied to the paddle by the ends of thestrings which work it. The body is covered with a gut shirt.  [Illustration: FIG. 382.--Kaiak carved from a block of wood.]The paddle is of the common shape, and has the blade and the lower endof the shaft painted red. The strings for working this contrivance areof fine sinew braid. One string is tied into a little hole in the edgeof the hood, where the left ear would be, the other passes round theedge of the hood, and is tied at the right ear. These strings crossback of the head, and pass through two neat little ivory eyeboltsinserted in the deck, 1 inch abaft the cockpit, and 1 inch apart. Thestrings from the hands are not crossed, but pass through two similareyebolts, one at each edge of the deck, 2.5 inches from the cockpit.The ends of each set of strings are tied together. When the right pairand left pair of strings are pulled alternately, the man makes astroke and looks to the right, then “recovers” and looks to the left.Both stroke and “recovery” are aided by the elasticity of the arms.This specimen shows a great deal of mechanical ingenuity, and was theonly finished object of the kind seen.Fig. 382 (No. 89856 [783] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a kaiak intended for asimilar toy, which, when brought over for sale, had an unfinishedarmless doll in the cockpit. This was, unfortunately, lost inunpacking. The kaiak, which is 27.6 inches long, is not new, but hasbeen freshly scraped and painted on deck. It is also a foreign kaiak,being precisely like a model brought by Mr. Nelson from Norton Sound.It is not unlikely that this boat itself came from that region throughthe “Nunatañmiun,” unless, possibly, a southern kaiak had passedthrough the hands of enough people to reach a point where some PointBarrow native might see it. As far as we know no Point Barrow nativesvisit the regions where this form is used, and the model seems tooaccurate to have been made from a description._Juvenile implements._--We sometimes saw the children playing withlittle models of the implements and utensils used by their parents.Perhaps the commonest thing of this sort is the boy’s bow. As soon asa boy is able to walk his father makes him a little bow suited to hisstrength, with blunt arrows, with which he plays with the other boys,shooting at marks--for instance, the fetal reindeer brought home fromthe spring hunt--till he is old enough to shoot small birds andlemmings. We also saw children playing with little drums, and one manmade his little boy an elaborate kă´moti about 4 feet long. In thecollection are a number of miniature implements, spears, etc., some ofwhich have been already described, which were perhaps intended asplaythings for the children. As, however, they were all newly made, itis possible that they were merely intended to catch the fancy of thestrangers.No. 89451 [1113], from Nuwŭk, is a little snow shovel 4.5 inches long,with a blade 2.1 inches wide, rather roughly carved from a piece ofwalrus ivory.No. 89695 [1280] from Utkiavwĭñ, is a similar model of a deer lance,7 inches long, all in one piece and made of reindeer antler.No. 89797 [1186] from Utkiavwĭñ, is a quite well made model of thedrum used for accompanying singing and dancing, and is almost largeenough to have been used for a plaything. The stick is entirely out ofproportion, being merely a roughly whittled bit of lath, 13 incheslong._Games and sports._--The men have very few sports, though I havesometimes known them to amuse themselves by shooting at a mark withtheir rifles, and I once heard of a number of them wrestling. As faras I could learn, they wrestle “catch-as-catch-can” without anyparticular system. We never heard of anything like the athletic sportsmentioned by Egede[N499] and Crantz[N500] or the pugilism described bySchwatka among the people of King William’s Land, when two men standup to each other and exchange buffets till one or the other givesin.[N501] The women are very fond of playing “cat’s cradle” wheneverthey have leisure, and make a number of complicated figures with thestring, many of which represent various animals. One favorite figureis a very clever representation of a reindeer, which is made by movingthe fingers to run down hill from one hand to the other.[N502] Anotherfavorite amusement with the women and children is tossing threebullets or small pebbles with the right hand, after the manner of ajuggler, keeping one ball constantly in the air. Some of the women arevery skillful at this, keeping the balls up for a long time. This playis accompanied by a chant sung to a monotonous tune with very littleair, but strongly marked time. I never succeeded in catching the wordsof this chant, which are uttered with considerable rapidity, and donot appear to be ordinary words. It begins “yúɐ yúɐ yuká, yúɐ yúɐyuká;” and some of the words are certainly indelicate to judge fromthe unequivocal gestures by which I once saw them accompanied.    [Footnote N499: Greenland, p. 162.]    [Footnote N500: Vol. 1, p. 177.]    [Footnote N501: Science, vol. 4, No. 98, p. 545.]    [Footnote N502: Hall (Arctic Researches, p. 129) says the “cat’s    cradle” is a favorite amusement in Baffin Land, where they make    many figures, including representations of the deer, whale, seal,    and walrus.]In the winter the young women and girls are often to be seen tossing asnowball with their feet. A girl wets some snow and makes a ball aboutas big as her two fists, which of course immediately becomes a lump ofice. This she balances on the toe of one foot and with a kick and ajump tosses it over to the other foot which catches it and tosses itback. Some women will keep this up for a number of strokes.The young people of both sexes also sometimes play football, kickingabout an old mitten or boot stuffed with rags or bits of waste skin.I never saw them set up goals and play a regular game as they did inGreenland.[N503]    [Footnote N503: See Egede, p. 161, and Crantz, vol. 1, p. 177.]The little girls also play with the skipping rope. I once watchedthree little girls jumping. Two swung the rope and the other stood inthe middle and jumped. First they swung the rope under her feet to theright, then back under her feet to the left, and then once or twicewholly round under her feet and over her head, and then beganagain.[N504] They also play at housekeeping, laying sticks round torepresent the sides of the house, or outlining the house by pressingup ridges of snow between their feet. Sometimes they mark out acomplicated labyrinth on the snow in this way, and the game appears tobe that one shall guard this and try to catch the others if they comein, as in many of the games of civilized children.    [Footnote N504: Compare Parry’s Second Voyage, p. 541.]I have already spoken of the formal children’s dances. They often alsodance by themselves, beating on old tin cans for drums. One night Isaw a party of children having quite an elaborate performance near ourstation. The snow at the time was drifted up close under the eaves ofthe house. On the edge of the roof sat three little boys, each beatingvigorously on an empty tomato can and singing at the top of his lungs,while another boy and a little girl were dancing on the snow wavingtheir arms and singing as usual, and at the same time trying to avoidanother girl about thirteen years old, who represented a demon. Shewas stooping forward, and moving slowly round in time with the music,turning from side to side and rolling her eyes fiercely, while shelicked the blade of an open clasp knife, drawing it slowly across herlips. They seemed intensely in earnest, and were enjoying themselveshugely. After dancing a while at the station they went over to thevillage, and as they told me the next day spent the whole nightsinging in a vacant snow-house.They also amuse themselves in the winter by sliding on their kneesdown the steepest snowdrifts under the cliffs. A good deal of thetime, however, they are following their parents or other grown people,catching little fish or fetching twigs for firewood or helping drivethe dogs, though as a rule they are not made to do any regular workuntil they are pretty well grown.MUSIC._Musical instruments._--The only musical instrument in use among thesepeople is the universal drum[N505] or tambourine (kĕlyau), consistingof a membrane stretched over a hoop with a handle on one side, andused from Greenland to Siberia. It is always accompanied by the voicesinging or chanting. The player holds the handle in his left hand withthe membrane away from him, and strikes alternately on each side ofthe rim with a short heavy piece of ivory, or a long slender wand,rotating the drum slightly at the same time to meet the stroke. Thisproduces a loud, resonant, and somewhat musical note. There appears,however, to be no system of tuning these drums, the pitch of the notedepending entirely on accident.    [Footnote N505: Nordenskiöld calls this “the drum, or more    correctly, tambourine, so common among most of the Polar peoples,    European, Asiatic, and American; among the Lapps, the Samoyeds,    the Tunguses, and the Eskimo.” (Vega, vol. 2, p. 128).]  [Illustration: FIG. 383.--Drum.]We collected four of these drums, of which every household possessesat least one. They are all of essentially the same construction, butvary in size. No. 56741 [79], Fig. 383, has been selected as the type.The frame is a flat strip of willow 67 inches long, 1 inch wide, and0.3 inch thick, bent till the two ends meet, thus making a hoop 22.2inches long and 19 inches wide. The ends are fastened together by astrap of walrus ivory on the inside of the hoop, secured to the woodby neat stitches of black whalebone. The handle is of walrus ivory 5.2inches long. The larger end is rather rudely carved into a human face.Back of this head and 1 inch from the large end of the handle is asquare transverse notch, deep and sufficiently wide to fit over bothrim and strap at the joint. It is held on by a lashing of sinew braidpassing through holes in rim and strap, one on each side of thehandle, and a large transverse hole in the latter, below and a littlein front of the notch. The membrane, which appears to be a sheet ofthe peritoneum of a seal, is stretched over the other side of thehoop, which is beveled on the outside edge, and its edge is broughtdown to a deep groove 0.2 inch from the edge of the hoop and 0.3 inchwide, running round the hoop, where it is secured by three or fourturns of sinew braid. The end of this string is crossed back and forthfour or five times round the handle, where it is fitted to the hoopand then wrapped around it and finished off with a knot.No. 56742 [514], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a similar drum, but somewhatlarger, the hoop being 24.6 inches long and 22 inches wide. It is ofthe same materials, except that the strap at the joint is of reindeerantler. Opposite the joint the hoop appears to have shown signs ofweakness, as it has been strengthened with two straps of walrus ivory,one on the inside and one on the outside of the hoop, fastenedtogether by stitches of sinew which pass through the wood and throughboth straps. The inside strap is 4.7 inches long, the outer 3.5 incheslong, and only half the width of the rim, and is let into the latter.This strap appears to have been put on first, as at each end there isa stitch which only runs through the wood. The handle is fastened onas before, but has two transverse holes instead of one, and has fourdeep rounded notches for the fingers. (See Fig. 384.) The joint istightened by driving a thin sliver of wood in at the bottom of thenotch.  [Illustration: FIG. 384.--Handle of drum secured to rim.]No. 56743 [31], from Utkiavwĭñ, closely resembles the type, but has anotch for the thumb as well as for the forefinger on the handle. Thehoop is 23.5 inches long and 21 wide. No. 56740 [80] from the samevillage is rather smaller than the ordinary drums, having a hoop 16.2inches long and 14.7 wide. The handle is of antler, but has the usualface on the large end.We also brought home eight handles for these drums, which exhibit butslight variations. The commonest material for the handle is walrusivory. Only two out of the twelve are of antler. They are usuallyabout 5 inches long (the longest is 5.4 inches and the shortest 4.6).Handles with grooves for the fingers and sometimes for the thumb seemto be quite as common as the plain handles. Fig. 385_a_ represents anivory handle from Nuwŭk (No. 89267 [898]), which has a groove for eachfinger and a shallow one on the right side for the thumb. It is 5inches long.With one exception all these handles have the large end more or lessneatly carved into a human face, with the mouth open as if singing,probably from an idea similar to that which makes the decorativeartists of civilized countries ornament the pipes of a great organwith singing faces. This face is usually in the position shown in thespecimens figured, but No. 89266 [784] (Fig. 385_b_), a handle ofantler from Utkiavwĭñ, has the axis of the face parallel to that ofthe handle. Nos. 89269 [975] and 56515 [76], both from Utkiavwĭñ, arepeculiar in their ornamentation. They are both of walrus ivory. Theformer has a well-carved face at the large end with small blue beadsinlaid for eyes. In addition to this the small end has been ratherfreshly carved into a rather rude seal’s head, and an ornamentalpattern has been incised round the middle. This specimen exhibits thegrooves for the fingers very well. The latter is a plain handle, buthas a little sharp tusk inserted at each corner of the mouth. The onlyhandle without a human face on the large end (No. 56514 [65] Fig.385_c_, from Utkiavwĭñ) is peculiar in many respects. It is the buttend of a small walrus tusk, with a large pulp cavity, the edges ofwhich are much notched and irregularly broken. The notch for fittingit to the handle is at the smaller end, which is neatly carved into avery good figure of a walrus head, with the tusks bent back to theunder side of the handle. The head has oval bits of wood inlaid foreyes. None of the drums or handles in the collection are newly made.  [Illustration: FIG. 385.--Drum handles. 1/2]The stick employed for beating these drums is commonly a slenderelastic wand about 2½ feet long, but they also sometimes use a shortthick stick of ivory resembling that used by the eastern Eskimo.[N506]We brought home two of these sticks, both of which belong with thedrum No. 56743 [31]. Fig. 386_a_ (No. 56540 [31]) is a roughlycylindrical rod of ivory with a hole for a lanyard. The larger end isornamented by rudely incised and darkened lines which represent theeyes and outline of the mouth of a “bow-head” whale. Fig. 386_b_(No. 56540 [31_a_]) is a plain round stick of ivory 9.4 inches long.It is rather roughly made and somewhat warped. The use of the longstick is perhaps derived from Siberia, where the short thick stickdoes not appear to be used.[N507]    [Footnote N506: See, for example, Bessell’s Naturalist, vol. 18,    pt. 9, p. 881. (The people of Smith Sound use the femur of a    walrus or seal. Cf. Capt. Lyon’s picture, Parry’s 2d Voyage, pl.    opposite p. 530, and Gilder, Schwatka’s Search, p. 43, where the    people of the west shore of Hudson Bay are described as using a    “wooden drumstick shaped like a potato-masher.”)]    [Footnote N507: See Hooper, Tents, etc., p. 51, and Nordenskiöld,    Vega, vol. 2, pp. 23 and 128; figure on p. 24.]Holes in the membrane of the drum are sometimes mended with pieces ofthe crop of the ptarmigan. At any rate, this is what I was told by anative, who begged from me the crops of two of these birds that I wasskinning, saying that he wanted them to mend his drum. These drums arealways beaten as an accompaniment to invocations of spirits orincantations. This practice is so common that some authors are in thehabit of always speaking of them as “shaman drums”. As I have alreadystated, their most common use is purely as a musical instrument, andthey are used not only by the so-called “shamans” but by everybody.  [Illustration: FIG. 386.--Ivory drumsticks. 1/4]_Character and frequency of music._--Their music consists ofmonotonous chants, usually with very little perceptible air, andpitched generally in a minor key. I could not perceive that they hadany idea of “tune,” in the musical sense, but when several sangtogether each pitched the tune to suit himself. They, however, keepexcellent time. The ordinary songs are in “common” or 4/4 time.[N508]The words are often extemporaneous, and at tolerably regular intervalscomes the refrain, “A yáña yáña, a yáña ya,” which takes the place ofthe “ámna aja” of the eastern Eskimo. Sometimes, when they are hummingor singing to themselves, the words are nothing but this refrain.Their voices, as a general thing, are musical.    [Footnote N508: Compare Crantz, vol. 1, p. 176.]Like all Eskimo, they are very fond of music, and are constantlysinging and humming to themselves, sometimes, according to Capt.Herendeen, waking up in the night to sing. Besides their regularfestivals they often amuse themselves in their houses by singing tothe drum. They are fond of civilized music, and, having usually veryquick and rather acute ears, readily catch the tunes, which they singwith curiously mutilated words. We found “Shoo Fly” and “Little BrownJug” great favorites at the time of our arrival, and one old womanfrom Nuwŭk, told us with great glee, how Magwa (Maguire) used to sing“Tolderolderol.” Our two violins, the doctor’s and the cook’s, were aconstant source of delight to them.Capt. Parry[N509] gives an excellent account of the music of thepeople of Fury and Hecla Straits.[N510]    [Footnote N509: 2d Voyage, p. 541.]    [Footnote N510: See also the passage from Crantz, quoted above;    Dall, Alaska, p. 16; and Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2, pp. 23 and    130.]I regret extremely that I was not enough of a musician to write downon the spot the different tunes sung by these people. The ordinarymonotonous chant is so devoid of air that I can not possibly recollectit, and the same is true of the chant which accompanies the game ofpebble-tossing. I was able, however, to catch by ear the song sung bythe children when they dance to the aurora. I never had the whole ofthis song, which we were told had a large number of stanzas. The firstthree are as follows:  1. Kióya ke, kióya ke,     A, yáñɐ, yañɐ, ya,     Hwi, hwi, hwi, hwi!  2. Túdlĭmaná, túdlĭmaná,     A yáñɐ, yañɐ, ya,     Hwi, hwi, hwi, hwi!  3. Kálutaná, kalutaná,     A yáñɐ, yáñɐ, ya,     Hwi, hwi, hwi, hwi!We did not succeed in learning the meaning of these words, except, ofcourse, that the first word, kióya, is aurora. When there is a brightaurora, the children often keep on dancing and singing this song tilllate into the night. A tune was introduced in the spring of 1883 by aparty of men from Kĭlauwĭtáwĭñ, who came up to take part in thewhale-fishing at Utkiavwĭñ. It became at once exceedingly popular, andeverybody was singing or humming it. It is peculiar in being in waltzor 3/4 time, and has considerably more air than the ordinary tunes.I heard no words sung to it except: “O hai hai yáña, O hai yáña,O haíja he, haíja he.” Mr. Dall informs me that he recognizes thistune as one sung by the Indians on the Yukon.ART.The artistic sense appears to be much more highly developed among thewestern Eskimo than among those of the east. Among the latter,decoration appears to be applied almost solely to the clothing, whiletools and utensils are usually left plain, and if ornamented are onlyadorned with carving or incised lines.[N511] West of the MackenzieRiver, and especially south of Bering Strait, Eskimo decorative artreaches its highest development, as shown by the collections in theNational Museum. Not only is everything finished with the most extremecare, but all wooden objects are gaily painted with various pigments,and all articles of bone and ivory are covered with ornamentalcarvings and incised lines forming conventional patterns.    [Footnote N511: See the various accounts of the eastern Eskimo    already referred to.]There are in the collections also many objects that appear to havebeen made simply for the pleasure of exercising the ingenuity inrepresenting natural or fanciful objects, and are thus purely works ofart. Want of space forbids any further discussion of these interestingobjects. There is in the Museum sufficient material for a largemonograph on Eskimo art. As would naturally be expected, art at PointBarrow occupies a somewhat intermediate position between the highlydeveloped art of the southwest and the simple art of the east. I havegiven sufficient figures in my description of their clothing andvarious implements to illustrate the condition of purely decorativeart. A few words may be added by way of résumé. It will be noticedthat whenever the bone or ivory parts of weapons are decorated theornamentation is usually in the form of incised lines colored with redocher or soot. These lines rarely represent any natural objects, butgenerally form rather elegant conventional patterns, most commonlydouble or single borders, often joined by oblique cross lines orfringed with short, pointed parallel lines.A common ornament is the incised “circle and dot,” so often referredto in the foregoing descriptions. This is a circle about one-quarterinch in diameter, described as accurately as if done with compasses,with a deeply incised dot exactly in the center. This ornament is muchmore common south of Bering Strait, where, as Mr. L. M. Turner informsme, it is a conventionalized representation of a flower. Some of theolder implements in our collection, ornamented with this figure, mayhave been obtained by trade from the southern natives, but the PointBarrow people certainly know how to make it, as there are a number ofnewly made articles in the collection thus ornamented. Unfortunately,we saw none of these objects in the process of manufacture, as theywere made by the natives during odd moments of leisure, and at thetime I did not realize the importance of finding out the process. Notool by which these figures could be made so accurately was everoffered for sale.Neither Mr. Turner nor Mr. Dall, both of whom, as is well known, spentlong periods among the natives of the Yukon region, ever observed theprocess of making this ornament. The latter, however, suggests that itis perhaps done with an improvised centerbit, made by sticking twoiron points close together in the end of a handle. While weapons aredecorated only with conventional patterns, other implements of bone orivory, especially those pertaining to the chase, like the seal drags,etc., already mentioned, are frequently carved into the shape ofanimals, as well as being ornamented with conventional patterns.Carvings of animals’ heads usually have the mouth, nostrils, etc.,indicated by blackened incisions, and often have small, colored beads,bits of wood, or ivory inlaid for the eyes. When beads are used, theperforation of the bead is generally made to represent the pupil ofthe eye. Beads were also used for ornamenting dishes and other woodenobjects.The harpoon blade boxes of wood carved into the shape of the animal tobe pursued have been already described. Other wooden objects, like theshafts of lances, and arrows, paddles, boxes, dishes, the woodwork ofsnowshoes, sledges, umiaks, etc., are frequently painted either allover, or in stripes or bands. The pigment generally used is red ocher,sometimes set off with stripes of black lead. The only case in which adifferent pigment is used is that of some arrows from Sidaru, which,in addition to the usual black or red rings, have a rather dingy greenring round the shaft. This green looks as if it might have beenderived from the “green fungus or _peziza_,” mentioned by Dall as inuse among the ancient Aleuts.[N512] The red ocher is applied smoothlyin a rather thin coat which looks as if it were always put on in themanner observed by Capt. Herendeen, who saw a man painting a new sledat Utkiavwĭñ. He licked the freshly scraped wood with his tongue, soas to moisten it with saliva and then rubbed it with a lump of redocher. The custom of painting wooden objects with red ocher seemed tobe rather more common among the “Nunatañmiun,” from whom perhaps thePoint Barrow people borrowed the fashion, which is not mentioned amongthe eastern Eskimo. Nordenskiöld states that red is the favorite coloramong the natives of Pitlekaj.[N513]    [Footnote N512: Contributions to N. A. Ethn., vol. 1, p. 86.]    [Footnote N513: Vega, vol. 2, p. 135.]The painting of the arrow shafts in many cases curiously resembles themarks used by modern archers to distinguish the ownership of theirshafts, and may have formerly served the same purpose. We made noinquiries about the matter on the spot, and there is no certainevidence in the series of arrows collected that these are or are notmarks of ownership. Some arrows, apparently the property of the sameman, have different marks, while arrows from different villages aresimilarly marked. On examining our series of fifty arrows from thethree villages (fourteen from Nuwŭk, twenty from Utkiavwĭñ, andsixteen from Sidaru) it will be seen that the commonest style ofpainting is to have the shaft painted red from the beginning or middleof the feathering to about one-fifth of its length from the head.Twenty arrows are marked in this way--eleven from Nuwŭk, belonging toat least two distinct sets, and nine from Utkiavwĭñ, belonging tothree sets. Nine have about 8 inches of the middle of the shaftpainted red, with a black ring at the middle of the feathering. Sevenof these are from Sidaru, one from Nuwŭk, and one from Utkiavwĭñ. Fivefrom Sidaru have a red ring round the middle, and a green one aboutthe middle of the feathering, and four of the same set have also a redring in front of the green one. Three from Utkiavwĭñ, belonging todifferent sets, have the shaft painted red from the middle to thebeginning of the feathering, and three red rings 2 inches from thenock. Seven belonging to these sets from the two northern villages areunpainted.A set of two small arrows which belong with the boy’s bow No. 89904[786] are peculiar in their marking. About 5½ inches of the middle ofthe shaft is painted red, there is a black ring round the middle, anda black spiral running the whole length of the feathering.The only decorative work in metal is to be seen in the pipes and theiraccompanying picks and fire steel which have already been described.In addition to these illustrations of decorative art, we brought homea series of seventy-nine objects which may be considered as purelyworks of art without reference to decoration. Some of the olderobjects in this series perhaps also served the purpose of amulets orcharms,[N514] but a number of the new ones were made simply as worksof fancy for sale to us. These objects are all carvings of variousmaterials, sometimes very rude and sometimes very neatly finished, butin most cases even when rudely made highly characteristic of theobject represented.[N515] Walrus ivory, usually from the tusks, butsometimes from the teeth, is the commonest material for thesecarvings. Thirty-six of the series are made of this material, which isvery well suited for the purpose, being worked with tolerable ease,and capable of receiving a high finish. Soapstone, from the ease withwhich it can be cut, is also rather a favorite material. Seventeen ofthese carvings are made of soapstone, in many cases evidently piecesof an old lamp or kettle. Other mineral substances appear to be rarelyused. Three images, all made for sale and by the same hand, are ofsoft white gypsum and one tiny image of a bear is rudely flaked out ofgray flint. (There are in the collection a number of rude images ofwhales, made by flaking from flint, jasper, and glass, but as thesewere ascertained without doubt to be amulets, they will be describedunder that head.) Eleven are made of wood, nine of bone, one ofantler, and one of the tooth of the polar bear. Twenty-three of thesecarvings represent human beings, sometimes intentionally grotesque andcaricatured; twenty-one, bowhead whales; fourteen, polar bears; five,seals; three, walruses; one, a beluga; one, a fish; and seven,fanciful monsters. Four are ornamented objects made for sale; not,strictly speaking, images.    [Footnote N514: Compare Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2, p. 126 and    Rink, Tales, etc., p. 52.]    [Footnote N515: Compare Bessels, Naturalist, vol. 18, No. 9,    p. 880, where he speaks of finding among the people of Smith Sound    ivory carvings representing animals and human figures “exceedingly    characteristic.” (See also Fig. 21 of the same paper.)]Six of the representations of the human face or figure are of wood,and with one exception were all freshly made for sale. Fig. 387represents the only antique specimen of this kind (No. 56496 [655]).This was found among the débris in one of the old ruined houses inUtkiavwĭñ by Lieut. Ray, and is very old, blackened, and dirty. Thecarving was evidently done with a blunt instrument, probably a stonetool. This specimen, which was perhaps the head of a doll, is 7.1inches in total length, with a head 3.4 inches long. We saw no similarobject of modern construction.  [Illustration: FIG. 387.--Ancient carving, human head. 1/2]  [Illustration: FIG. 388.--Wooden figures.]Figs. 388_a_ and 388_b_ (Nos. 89726 [1192] and 89727 [1193], fromUtkiavwĭñ) are a pair of rather roughly whittled human figures, a manand woman, respectively, both without clothes (except that the womanhas a black-lead mark round the calf of each leg to indicate the topsof the boots). They were made for sale, and are perhaps unfinisheddolls. The man (No. 89726 [1192]) is 11 inches long and tolerably wellproportioned, except about the feet, which are very clumsily made. Theeyes and mouth are incised and the hair colored with black-lead. Thewoman (No. 89727 [1193]) is a very similar figure, but only 9.2 incheslong. She has prominent breasts, and her legs are shorter inproportion than the man’s.No. 89725 [1185], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a clumsy image of a man, rudelywhittled out of a flat, hardwood stick, 7¼ inches long. The body andlegs are long, the latter somewhat straddling, with clumsy feet. Theoutstretched arms are very short and stumpy. It has been painted allover with a thin coat of red ocher, and the legs and feet have a coatof black lead over this. The hair also is marked out with black lead,and a small opaque white bead is fastened with a peg to the middle ofthe breast. This image was made for the market.No. 56495_a_ [203], from Utkiavwĭñ, is of a pair of very rude images,also made solely for the market. Each is 8 inches long, and is merelyan oblong piece of board, flat and rough on the back, roughly beveledfrom the middle to each side in front. One end is surmounted by arather rudely carved human head, with the features in relief and theeyes and mouth incised. The eyebrows are marked out with black lead,and there is a longitudinal line of black lead down the middle of thefront.  [Illustration: FIG. 389.--Carving, face of Eskimo man. 1/2]Fig. 389 (No. 89724 [1123] from Nuwŭk) is the face of a male Eskimo,3.2 inches long, carved out of a flat piece of some coniferous woodweathered to a dark, reddish brown. The labrets are represented by twosmall, red glass beads with white centers, fastened on in the properposition with wooden pegs. There is a deep groove around the edge ofthe face into which is fastened a strip of yellowish wolfskin withlong fur to represent the trimming around the hood of the jacket. Thisspecimen was made for sale, and the carving is well executed. It is acharacteristic Eskimo face, and would pass for a portrait of Apaidyáo,a well known young Eskimo, who was employed by Lieut. Ray as a guideand hunter.  [Illustration: FIG. 390.--Grotesque soapstone image, “walrus man.”]We collected only two soap-stone carvings representing men, both ofwhich were newly made. One of these, Fig. 390 (No. 89569 [1095] fromNuwŭk), is a grotesque image 2.9 inches long, roughly carved from aflat piece of an old lamp or pot. This is almost exactly the form inwhich the Eskimo, especially the children, usually draw a man. Thewriter’s _portrait_ has been drawn in very much the same shape. Thefeatures are very rudely indicated, and a long projecting tusk of boneis inserted at each corner of the mouth and glued in with refuse oil.This figure is probably meant to represent the “man with tusks,”before referred to, who figures in several of the legendary fragmentswhich we obtained.No. 89568 [1108], from Utkiavwĭñ, probably represents the same being.It is a mask of soapstone, a piece of an old lamp, 2.8 inches long,with very characteristic features in low relief, and a pair of sharp,projecting, decurved tusks, about 1 inch long, which appear to be madeof the vibrissæ of the walrus. The back of the mask is roughlyhollowed out. No. 89575 [1014], from Nuwŭk, is a clumsy and carelesslymade image of a man, 3.4 inches long, whittled out of a flat, roughpiece of soft, white gypsum. The arms are short and clumsy and thelegs straddling, and there is a large elliptical hole through themiddle of the body. The features are indicated only by digging littlecavities for the eyes, nostrils, and mouth. This and two other imagesof the same material, a bear equally rude, and a very well carved andcharacteristic beluga, were made by the ingenious young native, Yöksa,previously mentioned.  [Illustration: FIG. 391.--Bone image of dancer.]The best bone figure of a man is shown in Fig. 391 (No. 89353 [1025],from Nuwŭk), also newly made. This is an image, 5 inches long, of thegiant “Kikámigo,” previously mentioned, and is a very excellent pieceof workmanship. The material is rather vascular compact bone. On thehead is a conical dancing cap, 1.4 inches high, made of deerskin, withthe flesh side out, and colored with red ocher, with a tuft of wolfhairs, 3 inches long, protruding from the apex. Around the middle ofthe cap is a narrow strip of the same material fringed on the loweredge with fifteen flat, narrow pendants of ivory, made to representmountain-sheep teeth. To the back of this strip is fastened ahalf-downy feather nearly 4 inches long. A slender wooden stick isstuck into the strip behind, so that the tip reaches just above theapex of the cap. To a notch in the end of this is tied a bit ofdressed deerskin, 1¼ inches long, cut into three strips.Fig. 392 (No. 89348 [1127], from Utkiavwĭñ) is an image neatly carvedfrom whale’s bone, which may have been meant for an amulet, orpossibly the handle of a drill cord, as it is not new, and has twooblique holes in the middle of the back, which meet so as to form alongitudinal channel for a string. The eyes, mouth, and labret holesare incised and filled with black dirt. The total length is 3.3inches.  [Illustration: FIG. 392.--Bone image of man. 1/2]Fig. 393 (No. 89344 [1272], from Utkiavwĭñ) is a very grotesque imageof a naked man, rudely carved from compact, rather porous bone,impregnated with oil, but scraped smooth. It is 5 inches long. Themouth and eyes are incised and blackened, and the nostrils simplybored out.The ivory carvings representing human figures are all of rather rudeworkmanship. No. 89352 [1100], Fig. 394, from Nuwŭk, is a tolerablygood figure, 3.3 inches long, of a sitting man holding up his handsbefore his face. This specimen is old and is made of walrus ivoryyellow from age and oil. No. 89351 [1085] from Nuwŭk, is a similarimage, 3.8 inches long, newly made, with the arms at the sides,roughly carved from coarse walrus ivory. The eyes and mouth areincised and filled with dark colored dirt. Fig. 395 (No. 89349 [980],from Nuwŭk) is an old image made of yellow walrus ivory and closelyresembling the bone image (No. 89348 [1127]) already figured, but withthe hands by the sides. It is 2.7 inches long and has a string 4inches long tied into the channel in the back.  [Illustration: FIG. 393.--Grotesque bone image.]  [Illustration: FIG. 394.--Ivory image, sitting man.]  [Illustration: FIG. 395.--Human figure carved from walrus ivory.]Nos. 89346 and 89347 [990], from Nuwŭk, are a pair of little men,standing erect, about 2 inches high, rather roughly carved, ofslightly yellow walrus ivory. Both have large, clumsy feet and legs,and the eyes, nostrils, and mouth incised and filled in as usual withdark colored dirt. The arms are in high relief. No. 89346 [990_b_] hashis hands clasped in front of him, while No. 89347 [990_a_] has themclasped behind his back. The legs of the latter are excavated on theinside as if to fit it upon the end of some object. It is moreprobable, however, that this image was carved from the foreshaft of aseal-dart, and that the excavation is merely the slot in the end ofthe latter. These two images are evidently modern, but do not appearfreshly made. No. 89345 [1273] from Utkiavwĭñ is a very rude image,2.6 inches long, having a very small head and no arms. It is somewhatdiscolored walrus ivory and quite dirty, and though evidently modern,from the appearance of the ivory, does not appear to be freshly made.This figure is even ruder in design than those from Siberia figured byNordenskiöld.[N516]    [Footnote N516: Vega, vol. 2, p. 127.]  [Illustration: FIG. 396.--Ivory carving, three human heads.]The best of our human figures from Point Barrow show much greater art,both in workmanship and design, than those just mentioned, but can notcompare with the elegant figures in the museum from the more southernparts of Alaska. The four remaining ivory carvings represent the humanface alone. No. 89342 [989], Fig. 396, from Nuwŭk, is a thick piece ofwalrus ivory 3.3 inches long and 1.6 wide, carved into three humanfaces, a man in the middle and a woman on each side, joined togetherat the side of the head. Though the workmanship is rough, the facesare characteristic. The man has labrets and a curved line of tattooingat each corner of the mouth, indicating the successful whaleman, andthe women, the usual tattooing on the chin. The eyes, nostrils,mouths, labrets, and tattooing are incised and blackened as usual.This specimen, though apparently modern, does not seem fresh enough tohave been made for sale. The seller called it “a man and his twowives” without giving them any names. It may be intended as a portraitof some celebrated whaleman.Fig. 397 is one of a pair of very rude faces (No. 56523 [52] fromUtkiavwĭñ), 1½ inches long, which were made for sale. It is simply awalrus-tooth cut off square on the ends and on one side rudely carvedinto a face, with the eyes and mouth incised and filled in with darkcolored dirt. Fig. 398 (No. 89343 [1124] from Nuwŭk) is a flat pieceof ivory (a bit of an old snow shovel edge), 4 inches long and 1.2inches wide, roughly carved and covered with incised figures. Theupper edge is carved into five heads: First, a rude bear’s head, withthe eyes and nostrils incised and blackened as usual; then four humanheads, with a face on each side. The front faces have the noses andbrows in low relief and the eyes, nostrils, and mouths incised andblackened; the back ones are flat, with the last three featuresindicated as before. At the end is a rude figure of a bear, headingtoward the right, with the ears in relief, the eyes and mouth roughlyincised and blackened, and the legs indicated by roughly incised andblackened lines on the obverse face. Both faces are covered withrudely incised and blackened lines.  [Illustration: FIG. 397.--Human head carved from a walrus tooth.]On the obverse there is a single vertical line between each pair ofheads. Below the bear’s head is a bear heading toward the right; underthe first human head, an umiak with four men; under the second,a “killer” (Orca) heading toward the right; under the third, two ofthe usual conventionalized whales’ tails suspended from a cross-line;and under the last, a “killer” with very large “flukes” heading towardthe left.  [Illustration: FIG. 398.--Elaborate ivory carving.]On the reverse there are, below the bear, a bear heading toward theright, below each of the human heads a whale’s tail with the flukesup, and under the bear’s head a bear heading toward the right. Thisend is perforated with a large round hole, into which is knotted a bitof deer sinew about 3 inches long, the other end of which is tiedround the junction of two little bowhead whales, each about 1 inchlong and carved out of a single piece of ivory, head to head. They arerather rudely carved and have the spiracles incised and blackened.This object appears freshly made, but perhaps commemorates theexploits of some four hunters. It was purchased along with otherobjects and its history was not learned at the time.  [Illustration: FIG. 399.--Bear carved of soapstone. 3/4]Perhaps the best image of a polar bear is No. 89566 [1252], Fig. 399,from Utkiavwĭñ, which is quite characteristic. It represents the bearstanding and was carved out of soft, gray soapstone with a knife, andfinished off smoothly with a file. It is 4 inches long. No. 89571[116_b_], from Nuwŭk, is a very rude flat soapstone bear, 1.9 incheslong, in profile, showing only one fore and one hind leg. It was madefor sale, but No. 89576 [966], from the same village, which is almostexactly like this, though smaller, is old. No. 89574 [1027], fromNuwŭk, is the gypsum carving of a bear, above referred to, which isvery like the preceding two specimens. It is 2.5 inches long and has alarge tail and large clumsy legs.No. 89578 [1051], Fig. 400, from Utkiavwĭñ, is a thin profile figureof a polar bear, made by flaking from dark gray flint. It is 1.4inches long, and the tail is disproportionately long. The specimendoes not appear to be new, and was perhaps intended for an amulet,like the flint whales already mentioned.  [Illustration: FIG. 400.--Bear flaked from flint.]The only bone figure of a bear in the collection, No. 89335 [1275],Fig. 401_a_, from Utkiavwĭñ, is very crude. It has a very long, slimbody and neck, and short, slender legs. The mouth, eyes, and nostrilsare incised and are blackened as usual. The carving is rudely done,but the specimen, which was made for sale, has been scraped smooth. Itis 5.5 inches long, and made of whale’s bone, soaked in oil to make itappear old.  [Illustration: FIG. 401.--Bone figures: (_a_) bear; (_b_) bear’s  head.]Fig. 401_b_ (No. 89471 [997], from Utkiavwĭñ) is the end of some oldimplement, 6 inches long, one end of which is carved into a ratherrude bear’s head, with the ears, nostrils, outline of the mouth, andthe vibrissæ incised and blackened. Sky-blue glass beads are inlaidfor the eyes and bits of tooth for the canine tusks. On the throat isa conventional figure with two “circles and dots,” all incised andblackened. The carving is freshly done, but soiled, to make it lookold.The three newly made ivory bears are all represented standing and arequite characteristic. All have the eyes, nostrils, and mouth incisedand blackened. Fig. 402_a_ (No. 89337 [1274], from Utkiavwĭñ) is thebest in execution. It is made of white ivory and is 3.3 inches long.No. 56524, [92], from Nuwŭk, is a small bear, 1.7 inches long, notquite so well carved, and disproportionally long-legged. The left hindleg has been broken off close to the body and doweled on with a woodenpeg. Another little bear from Nuwŭk (No. 89841 [992]) is still morerudely carved, but closely resembles the preceding.A larger carving, rather roughly executed (No. 89338 [1098], fromNuwŭk), represents a standing bear 3.2 inches long, holding a whalecrosswise in his mouth. The whale is a separate piece, held in by awooden peg driven through the bear’s lower jaw. This specimen is newlymade from rather coarse walrus ivory.Fig. 402_b_ (No. 89340 [953], from Utkiavwĭñ) is a very ancient ivoryimage of a bear, 3.4 inches long, which was evidently intended for anamulet, as there is a stout lug on the belly, into which are bored twooblique holes, so as to make a longitudinal channel for a string. Intothis is knotted a stout cord of loosely twisted sinew. The executionof the image is particularly good, but the design is very rude. Thespecimen is so ancient that the ivory of which it is made has becomealmost black.  [Illustration: FIG. 402.--Ivory figures of bears.]No. 56528_a_ [56_a_] from Utkiavwĭñ is a walrus tooth, 1.6 incheslong, carved into the shape of a bear’s head. Both design andexecution are very rude. Light blue glass beads are inlaid for theeyes, and the nostrils and outline of the mouth are incised and filledin with black dirt. It was made for sale. A still more rude carving,also made for sale, is No. 56528, from Utkiavwĭñ, which is an old andweathered canine tooth of the polar bear, with the point freshlywhittled so as to look something like a bear’s head. Two sky-blueglass beads are inlaid to represent the eyes and one for the nose, andthe mouth is incised and blackened.The walrus does not appear to be a favorite subject forrepresentation. The part of the collection already described showsthat it occurs very seldom as a decoration, and we obtained only threeimages of this animal, one in soapstone and two in ivory, all smalland very rude, both in design and execution. They are all newly made.The best image is shown in Fig. 403_a_ (No. 89333 [1384] fromUtkiavwĭñ). This is 2.3 inches long and made of coarse walrus ivory.The head is rather good, but the body simply tapers to a broken point.A bit of wood is inlaid for the left eye, but the right is merelyrepresented by a hole.Fig. 403_b_ (No. 89334 [1067], from Utkiavwĭñ) is exceedingly rude.The eyes, nostrils, and mouth are incised and blackened as usual, andthe vibrissæ (“whiskers”) are represented by rather large round pitson the snout, also filled in with black dirt. It is 2.9 inches long,and appears to have been dipped in the oil-bucket to make it look old.Both the images bear a strong resemblance to the rude carvings ofwalruses from Siberia figured by Nordenskiöld.[N517] No. 89570 [1271]from Nuwŭk is of soapstone, 2 inches long, with tusks rudely carvedfrom walrus ivory. The head is but roughly indicated, while the bodyis shaped like a slug, and is bifid at the pointed end to representthe hind flippers. The eyes and nostrils are roughly incised.    [Footnote N517: Vega, vol. 2, p. 142.]  [Illustration: FIG. 403.--Rude ivory figures of walrus.]  [Illustration: FIG. 404.--Images of seal--wood and bone.]The seal, on the other hand, is a favorite object for artisticrepresentation. It is seen often, as already described, as adecoration on various implements, especially the drag lines,generally in a very characteristic shape, and the five seal imagesin the collection are excellent in design and execution. Almostall are decidedly superior to those from Pitlekaj, figured byNordenskiöld.[N517b] All are newly made except No. 89737 [857_a_].Fig. 404_a_, from Utkiavwĭñ, which is 4.2 inches long, and made ofspruce, very old, weathered, and discolored with dirt and grease. Itis nicely carved and scraped smooth, and is very good in its generalproportions, though the details are not represented as in the otherimages.    [Footnote N517b: Vega, vol. 2, p. 142.]The best figure (No. 89330 [999] figured in the Point Barrow Rept.Ethnol., Pl. V, Fig. 6, from Utkiavwĭñ) is carved from walrus ivoryand is 4.3 inches long. It represents a male rough seal, and isexceedingly accurate and highly finished. The lower jaw is perforatedand a bit of sinew thread tied in to represent the drag line. Smallred glass beads with white centers are inlaid for the eyes. The otherthree are all of bone and represent dead male seals stretched on theirbacks with the drag line in their jaw as they are dragged home.No. 56579 [75], Fig. 404_b_, from Utkiavwĭñ, is 5.7 inches long, andvery smoothly carved from walrus jaw bone, with round bits of woodinlaid for the eyes. The proportions are excellent, but the detailsare not strongly brought out. This specimen is a little older than therest, and may have been an amulet for good luck in seal catching. Theother two are of compact white bone, perhaps that of the reindeer.No. 89331 [1143], from Utkiavwĭñ, is 3.4 inches long, and has thebreast and back flattened and the flippers in high relief. The anus,genital opening, and eyes are incised, the latter two filled in, asusual, with black dirt. The drag line is of sinew braid and has anivory cylinder slipped over it.  [Illustration: FIG. 405.--White whale carved from gypsum. 1/2]No. 89328 [1167], from Utkiavwĭñ, is the poorest in design. It is 5.6inches long and has the neck bent up as in dragging. The back of afreshly caught seal is always somewhat flattened by dragging it overthe ice, and this flattening is very much exaggerated in this carvingby the natural shape of the bone. The fore flippers are in highrelief, with three toes to each flipper, colored round the edge withred ocher. The tips of the hind flippers are joined together, and eachhas only two toes. The eyes, genital opening, and the spots on theback and belly are indicated by shallow round pits colored with redocher. The drag line is a double bit of sinew braid, which has on ittwo ivory cylinders, one ornamented with an incised pattern.We found but a single figure of the beluga, which is such a favoritesubject for Eskimo artists farther south. This is the gypsum carvingalready mentioned (No. 89573 [1015], Fig. 405, from Nuwŭk). It is 3.5inches long and is very characteristic, though rather short inproportion to its girth. It was neatly carved with a knife.The “bow-head” whale (Balæna mysticetus), is a very favorite subject,appearing often as a decoration and represented by 21 carvings. Threeof these are of wood, very much resembling in design and execution theharpoon boxes already described. They are all very old, and perhapswere charms to be carried in the boat to secure good luck in whaling.No. 89736 [857_b_], Fig. 406, from Utkiavwĭñ, is perhaps the bestproportioned of these figures, though the only details represented arethe flukes (which are broken), and the incised spiracles. It is 5.4inches long and made of spruce or hemlock, stained almost black bydirt, grease, and weathering. A long string of sinew braid is tiedround the “small.”  [Illustration: FIG. 406.--Wooden carving--whale. 1/2]No. 89735 [1036] from Utkiavwĭñ, is also a rather well proportionedfigure, rude in execution, with no details carved out except theflukes, one of which is broken. An angular bit of iron pyrites isinlaid to represent the left eye, and a similar piece appears to havebeen lost from the right eye. The anus is represented by a light blueglass bead inlaid in the belly. It is 8.8 inches long and made of softwood, probably cottonwood, weathered and stained to a dark brown. Itis very old and much chipped and cracked. Two small oblique holes inthe middle of the back make a transverse channel for a string. Thisspecimen was said by the man who sold it to have been dug up among theruins of one of the old houses in the village.No. 89734 [987] from Nuwŭk, is 12 inches long, very broad inproportion to its length, and rather rude in design, with a flatbelly, though neatly carved and scraped smooth. The spiracles and theoutline of the mouth are incised and little angular bits of brownquartz are inlaid for the eyes. Both flukes have been split off andpart of the right fluke has been fastened on again with a singlewooden treenail. It is of spruce or hemlock and has weathered to abrown color.  [Illustration: FIG. 407.--Whale carved from soapstone.]Fig. 407 (No. 89561 [1253] from Utkiavwĭñ) represents the best imageof a whale in the collection. It is very well proportioned, thoughperhaps a little clumsy about the flukes, with the external detailscorrectly represented. It is 4.5 inches long, neatly carved fromsoapstone, scraped smooth and oiled. It was made for sale. There arefive other round soapstone carvings of whales in the collection, butnone so good as this except a little one from Nuwŭk, (No. 89563 [986])2 inches long, which is almost an exact miniature of the preceding.This specimen is not new. Fig. 408 (No. 89557 [1267] from Utkiavwĭñ)is a rude _flat_ representation of a whale seen from above. It is 5.2inches long and roughly whittled out of the bottom of an old stonepot. The flippers are large and clumsy, and the spiracles slightlyincised. The specimen appears to be old, as does a similar one fromNuwŭk (No. 89559 [1188_a_]).  [Illustration: FIG. 408.--Rude flat image of whale.]No. 89558 [1266] from Utkiavwĭñ, and No. 89572 from Nuwŭk, both flatimages, are carelessly made for sale. The latter is simply arepresentation in soapstone of the conventional “whale’s tail” withthe “small” cut off to an angular point. No. 89325 [1160] fromUtkiavwĭñ is a clumsy, broad whale with a flat belly, 4.1 inches long,freshly carved from whale’s bone, and soaked in oil to make it lookold. The eyes, spiracles, and outline of the mouth are incised andfilled in with dark oil lees.  [Illustration: FIG. 409.--Ivory image of whale.]None of the ivory carvings of whales have any special artistic merit.Fig. 409 (No. 89323 [1024_a_] from Nuwŭk) is the best of these. It isa little better in design and execution than the preceding, which itresembles considerably. It is the female of a pair of little whalesmade of old brown walrus ivory, which is much cracked. The malediffers from the female only in the shape of the external sexualorgans, the male having a little round pit and the female a longsulcus. This, as well as the eyes, spiracles, and outline of themouth, is incised and filled in with dark colored dirt. The female is3.1 inches long, the male (No. 89324 [1024_b_]) 0.1 inch longer. Thesespecimens appear to be quite ancient.  [Illustration: FIG. 410.--Ivory image of whale.]Fig. 410 (No. 89326 [1086] from Nuwŭk) is very long and slender--4.3inches long and only 0.7 inch wide--with the belly perfectly flat, butotherwise a very good representation, neatly carved. The flukes inparticular are especially well done, and the flippers are in highrelief. The eyes, the spiracles, and the outline of the mouth areincised and the first blackened. The material is a rather poor qualityof walrus ivory, about half “core.” The specimen was made for sale.No. 89327 [991] from Nuwŭk was also made for sale. It is a littlewhale 1.6 inches long, rudely carved in walrus ivory.  [Illustration: FIG. 411.--Pair of little ivory whales.]Fig. 411 (No. 56619 [66] from Utkiavwĭñ) represents a pair of littlewhales, each carved from a walrus tooth, which probably served forbuttons or toggles of some sort, though I do not recollect ever seeingsuch objects in use. The belly of each is flat and has in the middle astout lug perforated with a transverse eye, and they are tied togetherby a piece of thong about 14 inches long. They are quite well designedand executed, but rather “stumpy” in outline, with the outline of themouth and the spiracles incised and blackened, and little round bitsof tooth inlaid for eyes. In the middle of the back of each was inlaida small blue glass bead, which still remains in one of them. They areold and dirty and somewhat chipped about the flukes.  [Illustration: FIG. 412.--Soapstone image of imaginary animal.]  [Illustration: FIG. 413.--Ivory carving, seal with fish’s head.]Fig. 412 (No. 89567 [904] from Nuwŭk) represents an imaginaryquadruped 2.5 inches long, with a short, thick body and legs, no neck,and a human head, with the eyes and mouth incised. It is roughlycarved from light gray soapstone, and ground pretty smooth. Thisfigure is not new, and has probably connected with it some story whichwe did not succeed in learning. The seller called it an “old man.” No.89332 [994] from Nuwŭk, is a fanciful monster, 4.2 inches long, carvedin ivory. It has a human head with the tusks of a walrus, the body,tail, and flippers of a seal, with human arms. The hands, each ofwhich has four fingers, clasp some round object against the belly. Itis not old, but apparently was not made for the market. It was calleda “walrus man;” but we did not learn whether it was simply a fancyfigure or whether there was any story connected with it.Fig. 413 (No. 89329 [1101] from Nuwŭk) is another monster, 3.9 incheslong, carved in ivory. It has a fish’s head with large canine teeth,and a seal’s body, tail, and hind flippers. The eyes, nostrils, gillslits, the outlines of the tail, and the toes, of which there are sixon each flipper, are incised and blackened. A row of nineteen smallround pits, filled with dark colored dirt runs nearly straight fromthe nape to the tail.  [Illustration: FIG. 414.--Ivory carving, ten-legged bear.]Fig. 414 (No. 89339 [1099] from Nuwŭk) is a newly made ivory figure,which is interesting from its resemblance to one of the fabulousanimals which figure in the Greenland legends. It is 4 inches long andrepresents a long-necked bear with ten legs, an animal which the makergave us to understand had once been seen at Point Barrow. Theresemblance of this animal to the “kiliopak” or “kilifvak” of theGreenland stories, which is described as “an animal with six or eventen feet”[N518] is quite striking.    [Footnote N518: Rink, Tales, etc., p. 48. See also same work,    passim, among the stories.]  [Illustration: FIG. 415.--Ivory carving, giant holding whales.]Fig. 415 (No. 89723 [1084] from Nuwŭk) is another representation ofthe giant who holds a whale in each hand. He was called in thisinstance “Kaióasu,” and not “Kikámigo.” This image is carved from veryold pale brown walrus ivory, and is 2.3 inches high. A transverseincised line across each cheek from the wing of the nose, indicatesthe whaleman’s tattoo mark of the Eastern fashion. The image isancient, but is mounted in a socket in the middle of a newly madewooden stand, which has a broad border of red ocher and a broad streakof the same paint along each diameter.Fig. 416 (No. 89336 [1369]) is a curious piece of carving, whichNĭkawdalu said he found in one of the ruined houses on the riverKulugrua. The carving is well executed and really seems to be old,although it has evidently been retouched in a good many places. It ismade from an irregularly flattened bit of reindeer antler, 3.6 incheslong, blackened by the weather on the flat surfaces, and represents ananimal with four legs, which appear to be dog’s legs, and at each endwhat appears to be a dog’s head. One of these is smaller than theother and both have the ears in relief, and the eyes, nostrils, andoutlines of the mouth incised.  [Illustration: FIG. 416.--Double-headed animal, carved from antler.]Fig. 417 (No. 56520 [85] from Nuwŭk) is a fanciful object made solelyfor the market. It consists of the rudely carved head of somecarnivorous animal, made of ivory, and 2.6 inches long, fitted to thebroad end of a flat pointed wooden handle, painted red. The head wascalled a “dog”, but it looks more like a bear. Small bits of wood areinlaid for the eyes, and the outline of the mouth is deeply incisedand colored with red ocher, having bits of white ivory inlaid torepresent the canine teeth. The ears, nostrils, vibrissæ, and hairs onthe muzzle are indicated by blackened incisions. There is anornamented collar round the neck, to which is joined a conventionalpattern of triangular form on the throat, and a somewhat similarpattern on the top of the head between the ears.  [Illustration: FIG. 417.--Ivory carving, dog.]One of the natives at Utkiavwĭñ, in May, 1882, conceived the fancy ofsmoothing off the tip of a walrus tusk into the shape of a pyramid,surmounted by a little conical cap and ornamenting it with incisedfigures, which he colored with red ocher. It appears to have beenpurely an individual fancy, as it has no utility, nor are such objectsmade by the Eskimo elsewhere, as far as I know. Having succeeded infinding a sale for this object, either he or one of his friends, I donot now recollect which, made another, which was brought over for saleabout ten days later. We saw no others afterwards.  [Illustration: FIG. 418.--Engraved ivory: (_a_) piece engraved with  figures; (_b_) development of pattern.]  [Illustration: FIG. 419.--Engraved ivory: (_a_) piece with  engraving; (_b_) development of pattern.]Fig. 418_a_ (pattern developed in Fig. 418_b_, No. 56530 [220])represents the first of these. It is made of solid white walrus ivory.The workmanship is quite rude, and the cap has been broken off andneatly fastened on with a wooden dowel. The other, Fig. 419_a_, 419_b_(No. 56529 [254]) is 3.7 inches long.  [Illustration: FIG. 420.--Ivory doll.]Fig. 420 (No. 89741 [1012] from Nuwŭk) is an ivory cross 15.5 incheslong. The cross is ornamented by incised rings and dots colored withred ocher. The shaft of the cross is surmounted by a female human headneatly carved from soapstone, fastened on by a lashing of sinew braid,which passes through a transverse hole in the head and round thecrosspiece. No. 89742 [1091], also from Nuwŭk, closely resembles thepreceding, but is slightly shorter and has a four-sided shaft. Thehead, moreover, which is made of bone, represents a man, as is shownby the little pits, which indicate the labrets. The cheeks and crownof the head are colored slightly red with red ocher.The ingenious Yöksa, so often mentioned, made the first image andbrought it down for sale. All he could or would tell us about it wasthat it was “tună´ktûp kuni´a,” “A kuni´a (jargon for woman) ofsoapstone.” The successful sale of this first cross encouraged him tomake the second, but we saw no others before or after. Other nativeswho saw these objects only laughed. The whole may be simply a fancifuldoll, perhaps meant for a caricature, the shaft representing the body,and the crosspiece the outstretched arms. The object is verysuggestive of a crucifix, and there is a bare possibility that themaker may have seen something of the sort in the possession of some ofthe eastern natives who have been visited by a missionary of the RomanCatholic Church (Father Petitot).Under the head of works of art may properly be included No. 89823[1130], from Utkiavwĭñ. This is the skeleton of the jaws of a polarbear, cut off just back of the nose, neatly sewed up in a piece ofsealskin with the hair out, so as to leave uncovered only the tips ofthe jawbones and the canine teeth. This specimen was put up by thesame quick-witted young native after his removal from Nuwŭk toUtkiavwĭñ, evidently in imitation of the work of preparing specimensof natural history, which he had seen done at the station. For thesame reason he dried and carefully preserved in a little box whittledout of a block of wood and tied up with sinew a little fresh-watersculpin (Cottus quadricornis), which he had caught at Kulugrua(No. 89536 [1145]).I regret much that we did not save and bring home any of the pencildrawings made by these people. The children especially were anxious toget lead pencils, and made themselves rather a nuisance by coveringthe painted walls of the observatory with scrawls of ships and variousother objects, perhaps rather more accurately done than they wouldhave been by white children of the same age. The style of the figureson the hunting scores already described, however, is very like that ofthe pencil drawings.[N519]    [Footnote N519: Compare these with Nordenskiöld’s figures of    “Chukch” drawings, Vega, vol. 2, pp. 132, 133. The latter are    completely Eskimo in character.]DOMESTIC LIFE._Marriage._--As far as we could learn, the marriage relation wasentered upon generally from reasons of interest or convenience, withvery little regard for affection, as we understand it, though thereoften appeared to be a warm attachment between married people. A mandesires to obtain a wife who will perform her household duties welland faithfully, and will be at the same time an agreeable companion,while he often plans to marry into a rich or influential family. Thewoman, on the other hand, appears to desire a husband who isindustrious and a good hunter. There were, nevertheless, someindications that real love matches sometimes took place. Marriages areusually arranged by the parents of the contracting parties, sometimeswhen the principals are mere children. We knew of one case when ayoung man of about twenty-two offered himself as the prospectivehusband of a girl of eight or ten, when she should reach amarriageable age. This practice of child betrothal seems to bepractically universal among the Eskimo everywhere.[N520]    [Footnote N520: Compare Crantz, vol. 1, p. 159 (Greenland);    Kumlien, Contributions, p. 164 (Cumberland Gulf); Hall, Arctic    Researches, p. 567 (Baffin Land); Parry, 2nd Voyage, p. 528 (Fury    and Hecla Straits); Schwatka, Science, vol. 4, No. 98, p. 544    (King William’s Land); Gilder, Schwatka’s Search, p. 250 (Hudson’s    Bay); Franklin, First Exp., vol. 2, p. 41 (Chesterfield Inlet);    Hooper, Tents, etc., p. 209 (Plover Bay); Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol.    2, p. 26 (Pitlekaj).]Dr. Simpson, in describing the marriage customs at Point Barrow, says:  The usual case is, that as soon as the young man desires a partner  and is able to support one, his mother selects a girl according to  her judgment or fancy, and invites her to the hut, where she first  takes the part of a “kivgak” or servant, having all the cooking and  other kitchen duties to perform during the day, and returns to her  home at night. If her conduct proves satisfactory, she is further  invited to become a member of the family.[N521]    [Footnote N521: Op. cit., p. 252.]We only knew this to be done on one occasion; and on the contrary knewof several cases where the bridegroom became a member of the wife’sfamily.One youth, who had had his lips pierced for the labrets justpreviously to our arrival, was, we soon learned, betrothed to a younggirl at Nuwŭk. This girl frequently came down from Nuwŭk and visitedher lover’s family, staying several days at a time, but we could notdiscover that she was treated as a servant. She went with them to thespring deer hunt, but we were distinctly given to understand that theyoung couple would not be married till after the return from thishunt, and that no intercourse would take place between them beforethat time. When the season came for catching reindeer fawns, thecouple started off together, with sled and dogs and camp equipage inpursuit of them, and always afterwards were considered as man andwife.Most of the marriages took place before we heard of them, so that wehad no opportunity for learning what ceremony, if any, occurred at thetime. Some of the party, however, who went over to make a visit atUtkiavwĭñ one evening, found the house full of people, who weresinging and dancing, and were told that this was to celebrate themarriage of the daughter of the house. Marriage ceremonies appear tobe rare among the Eskimo. A pretended abduction, with the consent ofthe parents, is spoken of by Bessels at Smith Sound[N522] and Egede inGreenland (p. 142), and Kumlien was informed that certain ceremonieswere sometimes practiced at Cumberland Gulf.[N523] Elsewhere I havenot been able to find any reference to the subject. A man usuallyselects a wife of about his own age, but reasons of interest sometimeslead to a great disparity of age between the two. I do not recollectany case where an old man had a wife very much younger than himself,but we knew of several men who had married widows or divorced womenold enough to be their mothers,[N524] and in one remarkable case thebride was a girl of sixteen or seventeen, and the husband a ladapparently not over thirteen, who could barely have reached the age ofpuberty.    [Footnote N522: Naturalist, vol. 18, pt. 9, p. 877.]    [Footnote N523: Contributions, p. 16.]    [Footnote N524: Compare Holm’s observations in East    Greenland--“idet et ganske ungt Menneske kan være gift med en    Kone, som kunde være hans Moder.” Geografisk Tidskrift, vol. 8,    p. 91.]This couple were married late in the winter of 1882-’83, andimmediately started off to the rivers, deer hunting, where the younghusband was very successful. This union, however, appeared to havebeen dissolved in the summer, as I believe the girl was living withanother and older man when we left the station. In this case, thehusband came to live with the wife’s family.As is the case with most Eskimo, most of the men content themselveswith one wife, though a few of the wealthy men have two each. I do notrecollect over half a dozen men in the two villages who had more thanone wife each, and one of these dismissed his younger wife during ourstay. We never heard of a case of more than two wives. As well as wecould judge, the marriage bond was regarded simply as a contractentered into by the agreement of the contracting parties and, withoutany formal ceremony of divorce, easily dissolved in the same way, onaccount of incompatibility of temper, or even on account of temporarydisagreements.We knew of one or two cases where wives left their husbands on accountof ill treatment. One of these cases resulted in a permanentseparation, each of the couple finally marrying again, though thehusband for a long time tried his best to get his wife to come back tohim. In another case, where the wife after receiving a beating ranaway to Nuwŭk, and, as we were told, married another man, her firsthusband followed her in a day or two and either by violence orpersuasion made her come back with him. They afterwards appeared tolive together on perfectly good terms.On the other hand, we know of several cases where men discarded wiveswho were unsatisfactory or made themselves disagreeable. For instance,the younger Tuñazu, when we first made his acquaintance, was marriedto a widow very much his senior, who seemed to have a disagreeable andquerulous temper, so that we were not surprised to hear in the springof 1882 that they were separated and Tuñazu married to a young girl.His second matrimonial venture was no more successful than his first,for his young wife proved to be a great talker. As he told us: “Shetalked all the time, so that he could not eat and could not sleep.” Sohe discarded her, and when we left the station he had been for sometime married to another old widow.In the case above mentioned, where the man with two wives discardedthe younger of them, the reason he assigned was that she was lazy,would not make her own clothes, and was disobedient to the older wife,to whom he was much attached. As he said, Kakaguna (the older wife)told her, “Give me a drink of water,” and she said, “No!” so Kakagunasaid, “Go!” and she went. He did not show any particular concern aboutit.Dr. Simpson says, “A great many changes take place before a permanentchoice is made;” and again, “A union once apparently settled betweenparties grown up is rarely dissolved.”[N525] And this agrees with ourexperience. The same appears to have been the case in Greenland.Crantz[N526] says, “Such quarrels and separations only happen betweenpeople in their younger years, who have married without dueforethought. The older they grow, the more they love one another.”    [Footnote N525: Op. cit., p. 253.]    [Footnote N526: Vol. 1, p. 160.]Easy and unceremonious divorce appears to be the usual custom amongEskimo generally, and the divorced parties are always free to marryagain.[N527] The only writer who mentions any ceremony of divorce isBessels, who witnessed such among the so-called “Arctic Highlanders”of Smith Sound (Naturalist, vol. 18, pt. 9, p. 877). Dr. Simpson, inthe paragraph referred to above, says that “A man of mature agechooses a wife for himself and fetches her home, frequently, to allappearance, much against her will.” The only case of the kind whichcame to our notice was in 1883, when one of the Kĭlauwitawĭñmeunattempted by blows to coerce Adwû´na, an Utkiavwĭñ girl, to live withhim, but was unsuccessful.    [Footnote N527: “They often repudiate and put away their wives, if    either they do not suit their humors, or else if they are barren,    * * * and marry others.” Egede, Greenland, p. 143. Compare also    Crantz, vol. 1, p. 160; Parry, Second Voyage, p. 528 (Fury and    Hecla Straits); Kumlien, Contributions, p. 17 (Cumberland Gulf);    and Hooper, Tents, etc., p. 100--“repudiation is perfectly    recognized, and in instances of misconduct and sometimes of    dislike, put in force without scruple or censure. * * * The    rejected wife * * * does not generally wait long for another    husband;” (Plover Bay.) Compare also Holm, Geografisk Tidskrift,    vol. 8, pp. 91-92, where he gives an account of marriage and    divorce in east Greenland, remarkably like what we observed at    Point Barrow.]A curious custom, not peculiar to these people, is the habitof exchanging wives temporarily. For instance, one man of ouracquaintance planned to go to the rivers deer hunting in the summer of1882, and borrowed his cousin’s wife for the expedition, as she was agood shot and a good hand at deer hunting, while his own wife wentwith his cousin on the trading expedition to the eastward. On theirreturn the wives went back to their respective husbands.The couples sometimes find themselves better pleased with their newmates than with the former association, in which case the exchangeis made permanent. This happened once in Utkiavwĭñ to our certainknowledge. This custom has been observed at Fury and HeclaStraits,[N528] Cumberland Gulf,[N529] and in the region aroundRepulse Bay, where it seems to be carried to an extreme.    [Footnote N528: Parry, 2nd Voyage, p. 528.]    [Footnote N529: Kumlien, Contributions, p. 16.]According to Gilder[N530] it is a usual thing among friends in thatregion to exchange wives for a week or two about every two months.Among the Greenlanders the only custom of the kind mentioned is thetemporary exchange of wives at certain festivals described byEgede.[N531]    [Footnote N530: Schwatka’s Search, p. 197.]    [Footnote N531: Greenland, p. 139.]Holm also describes “the game of putting out the lamps,” or “changingwives,” as a common winter sport in East Greenland. He also, however,speaks of the temporary exchange of wives among these people much asdescribed elsewhere.[N532]    [Footnote N532: Geogr., Tids., vol. 8, p. 92.]I am informed by some of the whalemen who winter in the neighborhoodof Repulse Bay, that at certain times there is a general exchange ofwives throughout the village, each woman passing from man to man tillshe has been through the hands of all, and finally returns to herhusband. All these cases seem to me to indicate that the Eskimo havenot wholly emerged from the state called communal marriage, in whicheach woman is considered as the wife of every man in the community._Standing and treatment of women._--The women appear to stand on afooting of perfect equality with the men both in the family and in thecommunity. The wife is the constant and trusted companion of the manin everything except the hunt, and her opinion is sought in everybargain or other important undertaking.[N533]    [Footnote N533: Compare Parry, 2d Voyage, pp. 526-528,    Nordenskiöld (Vega, vol. 1, p. 449): The women are “treated as    the equals of the men, and the wife was always consulted by the    husband when a more important bargain than usual was to be made.”    (Pitlekaj.) This statement is applicable, word for word, to the    women of Point Barrow.]Dr. Simpson’s description[N534] of the standing of the women at PointBarrow in his time is so true at the present day that I may bepardoned for quoting the whole of it:  A man seems to have unlimited authority in his own hut, but, as with  few exceptions his rule is mild, the domestic and social position of  the women is one of comfort and enjoyment. As there is no affected  dignity or importance in the men, they do not make mere slaves and  drudges of the women; on the contrary, they endure their full share  of fatigue and hardship in the coldest season of the year, only  calling in the assistance of the women if too wearied themselves to  bring in the fruits of their own industry and patience; and at other  seasons the women appear to think it a privation not to share the  labors of the men. A woman’s ordinary occupations are sewing, the  preparation of skins for making and mending, cooking, and the  general care of the supplies of provisions. Occasionally in the  winter she is sent out on the ice for a seal which her husband has  taken, to which she is guided by his footmarks; and in spring and  summer she takes her place in the boat if required.    [Footnote N534: Op. cit., p 252.]The statement in the first sentence that the husband’s rule is mild ishardly consistent with that on the following page that “obedienceseems to be the great virtue required, and is enforced by blows whennecessary, until the man’s authority is established.” According to ourexperience the first statement is nearer the truth. We heard of fewcases of wife-beating, and those chiefly among the younger men. Twobrothers, who habitually ill-treated their wives, were looked uponwith disfavor, by some of our friends at least. We heard of one casewhere a stalwart wife turned the tables on her husband who attemptedto abuse her, giving him a thorough beating and then leaving hishouse.Wife-beating was not uncommon among the Greenlanders.[N535] We did notlearn whether a woman brought anything like a dowry, but Simpson[N536]says: “The woman’s property, consisting of her beads and otherornaments, her needlecase, knife, etc., are considered her own; and ifa separation takes place the clothes and presents are returned and shemerely takes away with her whatever she brought.” According toCrantz[N537] a widow in Greenland had no share of her husband’sproperty, but owns only what she brought with her, and I am inclinedto believe that this is the case at Point Barrow.    [Footnote N535: See Egede, p. 144, “for according to them it    signifies nothing that a man beats his wife.”]    [Footnote N536: Op. cit., p. 253.]    [Footnote N537: Vol. 1, p. 165.]One widow of my acquaintance, who appeared to have no relatives in thevillage, was reduced almost to beggary, though her husband had beenquite well-to-do. All his property and even his boy were taken fromher by some of the other natives. Widows who have well-to-dorelatives, especially grown-up sons, are well taken care of and oftenmarry again. According to Captain Parry,[N538] unprotected widows wererobbed at Iglulik.    [Footnote N538: Second Voyage, p. 522.]_Children._--From the small number of births which occurred during ourstay at Point Barrow, we were able to ascertain little in regard tothis subject. When a woman is about to be confined, she is isolated ina little snow hut in winter or a little tent in summer, in which sheremains for some time--just how long we were unable to learn. CaptainHerendeen saw a pregnant woman in Utkiavwĭñ engaged, on March 31, inbuilding a little snow house, which she told him was meant for herconfinement, but she had evidently somehow miscalculated her time, asher child was not born till much later, when the people had moved intothe tents. She and her child lived in a little tent on the beach closeto her husband’s tent, evidently in a sitting position, as the tentwas not large enough for her to lie down in. Her husband was desirousof going off on the summer deer hunt, but, under the circumstances,custom forbade his leaving the neighborhood of the village till theice at sea broke up. The same custom of isolating the women duringchildbirth has been observed by Kumlien and Boas at CumberlandGulf[N539], and in Greenland the mother was not allowed to eat ordrink in the open air.[N540] Lisiansky describes a similar practice inKadiak in 1805,[N541] and Klutschak also notes it among theAivillirmiut.[N542]    [Footnote N539: Contributions, p. 28, and “Central Eskimo,”    p. 610.]    [Footnote N540: Egede, p. 192; Crantz, vol. 1, p. 215, and Rink,    Tales, etc., p. 54.]    [Footnote N541: Voyage, p. 200.]    [Footnote N542: “Als Eskimo, etc.,” p. 199.]The custom of shutting up the mother and child in a snow house inwinter must be very dangerous to the infant, and, in fact, the onlychild that was born in winter during our stay lived but a short time.Capt. Herendeen visited this family at Nuwŭk shortly after the deathof the child, and saw the snow house in which the woman had beenconfined. He was about to take a drink of water from a dipper which hesaw in the iglu, but was prevented by the other people, who told himthat this belonged to the mother and that it was “bad” for anyone elseto use it. In Greenland the mother had a separate water pail.[N543]For a time, our visitors from Utkiavwĭñ were very much afraid to drinkout of the tin pannikin in our washroom, for fear it had been used byNiăksăra, a woman who had recently suffered a miscarriage. One mantold us that a sore on his face was caused by his having inadvertentlydone so. This same woman was forbidden to go out among the broken iceof the land floe, during the spring succeeding her miscarriage, thoughshe might go out on the smooth shore ice. Her husband also wasforbidden to work with a hammer or adz or to go seal-catching for sometime after the mishap.    [Footnote N543: Egede, p. 192; Crantz, vol. 1, p. 215, “no one    else must drink out of their cup;” and Rink, Tales and Traditions,    p. 54.]Children are nursed until they are 3 or 4 years old, according to whatappears to be the universal habit among Eskimo, and which is probablydue, as generally supposed, to the fact that the animal food on whichthe parents subsist is not fit for the nourishment of young children.The child is carried naked on the mother’s back under her clothes, andheld up by the girdle, tied higher than usual. When she wishes tonurse it, she loosens her girdle and slips it round to the breastwithout bringing it out into the air. Children are carried in this wayuntil they are able to walk and often later.A large child sits astride of his mother’s back, with one leg undereach of her arms, and has a little suit of clothes in which he isdressed when the mother wishes to set him down. When the child isawake, this hood is thrown back and the child raised quite high sothat he looks over his mother’s shoulder, who then covers her headwith a cloth or something of the sort. The woman appears to be verylittle inconvenienced by her burden, and goes about her work as usual,and the child does not seem to be disturbed by her movements. Thelittle girls often act as nurses and carry the infants around on theirbacks, in the same way. It is no unusual sight to see a little girl often or twelve carrying a well grown, heavy child in this way.This custom or a very similar one seems to prevail among the Eskimogenerally. In Greenland, the nurse wears a garment especially designedfor carrying the child, an amaut, i.e., a garment that is so wide inthe back as to hold a child, which generally tumbles in it quite nakedand is accommodated with no other swaddling clothes or cradle.[N544]In East Greenland, according to Capt. Holm, “Saa længe Børnene eresmaa, bæres de i det fri paa Moderens Ryg.”[N545]    [Footnote N544: Crantz, vol. 1, p. 138. See also Egede, p. 131,    and the picture in Rink’s Tales, etc., opposite p. 8.]    [Footnote N545: Geografisk Tidskrift, vol. 8, p. 91.]Petitot’s description of the method of carrying the children in theMackenzie district is so naïve that it deserves to be quotedentire.[N546]  Les mères qui allaitent portent une jaquette ample et serrée autour  des reins par une ceinture. Elles y enferment leur chère progéniture  qu’elles peuvent, par ce moyen, allaiter sans l’exposer à un froid  qui lui serait mortel. Ces jeunes enfants sont sans aucun vêtement  jusqu’à l’âge d’environ deux ans. Quant aux incongruités que ces  petites créatures peuvent se permettre sur le dos de leur mère, qui  leur sert de calorifère, l’amour maternel, le même chez tous les  peuples, les endure patiemment et avec indifférence.    [Footnote N546: Monographie, etc., p. xv.]At Fury and Hecla Straits, according to Parry[N547], the children arecarried in the hood, which is made specially large on purpose, butsometimes also on the back, as at Point Barrow. The enormous hoods ofthe Eskimo women in Labrador also served to hold the child. The samecustom prevails at Cumberland Gulf.[N548] In some localities, forinstance the north shore of Hudson’s Straits, where the woman wearvery long and loose boots, the children are said to be carried inthese.[N549] Franklin[N550] refers to the same custom “east of theMackenzie River.” The Siberian children, however, are dressed inregular swaddling clothes of deerskin, with a sort of diaper of driedmoss.[N551]    [Footnote N547: Second Voyage, p. 495.]    [Footnote N548: Kumlien, Contributions, p. 24.]    [Footnote N549: See Ellis, Voyage, etc., p. 136, and plate    opposite p. 132.]    [Footnote N550: Second Ex., p. 226.]    [Footnote N551: Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2, p. 101.]We never heard of a single case of infanticide, and, indeed, childrenwere so scarce and seemed so highly prized that we never even thoughtof inquiring if infanticide was ever practiced. Nevertheless, Simpsonspeaks of the occurrence of a case during the Plover’s visit; “but achild, they say, is destroyed only when afflicted with disease of afatal tendency, or, in scarce seasons, when one or both parentsdie.[N552]” Infanticide, according to Bessels, is frequently practicedamong the Eskimo of Smith Sound, without regard of sex,[N553] andSchwatka speaks of female infanticide to a limited extent among thepeople of King William’s Land.[N554]    [Footnote N552: Op. cit., p. 250.]    [Footnote N553: Naturalist, vol. 18, pt. 9, p. 874.]    [Footnote N554: Science, vol. 4, p. 544.]The affection of parents for their children is extreme, and thechildren seem to be thoroughly worthy of it. They show hardly a traceof the fretfulness and petulance so common among civilized children,and though indulged to an extreme extent are remarkably obedient.Corporal punishment appears to be absolutely unknown and the childrenare rarely chidden or punished in any way. Indeed, they seldom deserveit, for, in spite of the freedom which they are allowed, they do notoften get into any mischief, especially of a malicious sort, butattend quietly to their own affairs and their own amusements.The older children take very good care of the smaller ones. It is anamusing sight to see a little boy of six or seven patronizing andprotecting a little toddler of two or three. Children rarely cryexcept from actual pain or terror, and even then little ones areremarkably patient and plucky. The young children appear to receivelittle or no instruction except what they pick up in their play orfrom watching their elders.Boys of six or seven begin to shoot small birds and animals and tohunt for birds’ eggs, and when they reach the age of twelve orfourteen are usually intrusted with a gun and seal spear and accompanytheir fathers to the hunt. Some of them soon learn to be very skillfulhunters. We know one boy not over thirteen years old who, during thewinter of 1881-’82, had his seal nets set like the men and used tovisit them regularly, even in the roughest weather. Lads of fourteenor fifteen are sometimes regular members of the whaling crews. In themeantime the little girls are learning to sew, in imitation of theirmothers, and by the time they are twelve years old they take theirshare of the cooking and other housework and assist in making theclothes for the family. They still, however, have plenty of leisure toplay with the other children until they are old enough to be married.Affection for their children seems a universal trait among the Eskimoand there is scarcely an author who does not speak in terms ofcommendation of the behavior and disposition of the Eskimo children.Some of these passages are so applicable to the people of Point Barrowthat I can not forbear quoting them. Egede says:[N555]  They have a very tender Love for their Children, and the Mother  always carries the infant Child about with her upon her back. * * *  They suck them till they are three or four years old or more,  because, in their tender Infancy, they cannot digest the strong  Victuals that the rest must live upon. The Education of their  Children is what they seem little concerned about, for they never  make use of whipping or hard words to correct them when they do  anything amiss, but leave them to their own Discretion.  Notwithstanding which, when they are grown, they never seem inclined  to Vice or Roguery, which is to be admired. It is true, they show no  great Respect to their Parents in any outward Forms, but always are  very willing to do what they order them, though sometimes they will  bid their Parents do it themselves.    [Footnote N555: Greenland, p. 146.]According to Capt. Holm,[N556] in East Greenland, “De opvoxe i denmest ubundne Frihed. Forældrene nære en ubeskrivelig Kjærlighed tildem og straffe dem derfor aldrig, selv om de ere nok saa gjenstridige.Man maa imidlertid beundre, hvor velopdragne de smaa alligevel ere.”    [Footnote N556: Geografisk Tidskrift, vol 8, p. 91.]Parry speaks still more strongly:[N557]  The affection of parents for their children was frequently displayed  by these people, not only in the mere passive indulgence and  abstinence from corporal punishment for which Esquimaux have been  before remarked, but by a thousand playful endearments also, such as  parents and nurses practice in our own country. Nothing, indeed can  well exceed the kindness with which they treat their children. * * *  It must be confessed, indeed, that the gentleness and docility of  the children are such as to occasion their parents little trouble  and to render severity towards them quite unnecessary. Even from  their earliest infancy, they possess that quiet disposition,  gentleness of demeanor, and uncommon evenness of temper, for which  in more mature age they are for the most part distinguished.  Disobedience is scarcely ever known; a word or even a look from a  parent is enough; and I never saw a single instance of that  frowardness and disposition to mischief which, in our youth, so  often requires the whole attention of a parent to watch over and to  correct. They never cry from trifling accidents, and sometimes not  even from very severe hurts, at which an English child would sob for  an hour. It is, indeed, astonishing to see the indifference with  which, even as tender infants, they bear the numerous blows they  accidentally receive when carried at their mothers’ backs.    [Footnote N557: Second Voyage, p. 529.]I should be willing to allow this passage to stand as a description ofthe Point Barrow children. It is interesting to compare with thesepassages Nordenskiöld’s account[N558] of the children at Pitlekaj,who, if not as he and other writers believe, of pure Chukch blood, areat any rate of mixed Chukch and Eskimo descent:  The children are neither chastised nor scolded. They are, however,  the best behaved I have ever seen. Their behavior in the tent is  equal to that of the best brought up European children in the  parlor. They are not perhaps so wild as ours, but are addicted to  games which closely resemble those common among us in the country.  Playthings are also in use. * * * If the parents get any delicacy  they always give each of their children a bit, and there is never  any quarrel as to the size of each child’s portion. If a piece of  sugar is given to one of the children in a crowd it goes from mouth  to mouth round the whole company. In the same way the child offers  its father and mother a taste of the bit of sugar or piece of bread  it has got. Even in childhood the Chukchs are exceedingly patient.  A girl who fell down from the ship’s stairs head foremost and thus  got so violent a blow that she was almost deprived of hearing  scarcely uttered a cry. A boy three or four years of age, much  rolled up in furs, who fell down into a ditch cut in the ice on the  ship’s deck, and in consequence of his inconvenient dress could not  get up, lay quietly still until he was observed and helped up by one  of the crew.    [Footnote N558: Vega, vol. 2, p. 140.]The only extraordinary thing about the Chukch children is their largenumber, mentioned by the same author.[N559] This looks as if theinfusion of new blood had increased the fertility of the race. Allauthors who have described Eskimo of unmixed descent agree in regardto the generally small number of their offspring. Other accounts ofEskimo children are to be found in the writings of Bessels,[N560]Crantz,[N561] Schwatka,[N562] Gilder,[N563] J. Simpson,[N564] andHooper.[N565]    [Footnote N559: Vega, vol. 1, p. 449.]    [Footnote N560: Naturalist, vol. 18, pt. 9, p. 874.]    [Footnote N561: History of Greenland, vol. 1, p. 162.]    [Footnote N562: Science, vol. 4, No. 98, p. 544.]    [Footnote N563: Schwatka’s Search, p. 287.]    [Footnote N564: Op. cit., p. 250.]    [Footnote N565: Tents, etc., pp. 24, 201.]The custom of adoption is as universal at Point Barrow as it appearsto be among the Eskimo generally, and the adopted children are treatedby the parents precisely as if they were their own flesh and blood.Orphans are readily provided for, as there are always plenty offamilies ready and willing to take them, and women who have severalchildren frequently give away one or more of them. Families that havenothing but boys often adopt a girl, and, of course, vice versa, andwe know of one case where a woman who had lost a young infant hadanother given her by one of her friends.This very general custom of giving away children, as well as the habitalready mentioned of temporarily exchanging wives, rendered it quitedifficult to ascertain the parentage of any person, especially as itseems to be the custom with them to speak of first cousins as “mĭluataúzĭk” (“one breast,” that is, brothers and sisters). While a boy isdesired in the family, since he will be the support of his father whenthe latter grows too old to hunt, a girl is almost as highly prized,for not only will she help her mother with the cares of housekeepingwhen she grows up, but she is likely to obtain a good husband who maybe induced to become a member of his father-in-law’s family.[N566]    [Footnote N566: Accounts of this custom of adoption are to be    found in Crantz, vol. 1, p. 165; Parry, Second Voyage, p. 531;    Kumlien, Contributions, p. 17; Gilder, Schwatka’s Search, p. 247,    and the passage concerning children quoted above, from Dr.    Simpson.]RIGHTS AND WRONGS.I have already spoken of the feelings of these people in regard tooffenses against property and crimes of violence. As to the relationsbetween the sexes there seems to be the most complete absence of whatwe consider moral feelings. Promiscuous sexual intercourse betweenmarried or unmarried people, or even among children, appears to belooked upon simply as a matter for amusement. As far as we could learnunchastity in a girl was considered nothing against her, and in factone girl who was a most abandoned and shameless prostitute among thesailors, and who, we were told, had had improper relations with someof her own race, had no difficulty in obtaining an excellent husband.Remarks of the most indecent character are freely bandied back andforth between the sexes in public, and are received with shouts oflaughter by the bystanders. Nevertheless, some of the women,especially those of the wealthier class, preserve a very tolerabledegree of conjugal fidelity and certainly do not prostitute themselvesto the sailors. I believe that prostitution for gain is unknown amongthemselves, but it is carried to a most shameless extent with thesailors of the whaling fleet by many of the women, and is evenconsidered a laudable thing by the husbands and fathers, who areperfectly willing to receive the price of their wives’ or daughters’frailty, especially if it takes the form of liquor. Dr. Simpson[N567]says: “It is said by themselves that the women are very continentbefore marriage, as well as faithful afterward to their husbands; andthis seems to a certain extent true.” But he goes on to add: “In theirconduct toward strangers the elderly women frequently exhibit ashameless want of modesty, and the men an equally shamelessindifference, except for the reward of their partner’s frailty.” Itseems to me that he must have been deceived by the natives concerningthe first statement, since the immorality of these people amongthemselves, as we witnessed it, seems too purely animal and natural tobe of recent growth or the result of foreign influence. Moreover,a similar state of affairs has been observed among Eskimo elsewhere,notably at Iglulik at the time of Parry’s visit.[N568]    [Footnote N567: Op. cit., p. 252.]    [Footnote N568: Second Voyage, p. 529.]SOCIAL LIFE AND CUSTOMS._Personal habits, cleanliness, etc._--Though the idea of cleanlinessamong these people differs considerably from our ideas, they are as arule far from being as filthy as they appear at first sight.Considering the difficulty of obtaining water, even for purposes ofdrinking, in the winter season, the iglu, unless dirty work, like thedressing of skins, etc., is going on, is kept remarkably clean. Thefloor and walls are scrupulously scraped and all dirt is immediatelywiped up. They are particularly careful not to bring in any snow ordirt on their feet, and the snow and hoar frost is carefully brushedoff from the outer garment, which is often removed before entering theroom and left in the passage. They are also careful not to spit on thefloor or in the passage, but use for this purpose the large urine tub.This is practically the only offensive object in the house, as it isfreely used by both sexes in the presence of the rest. This is done,however, with less exposure and immodesty than one wouldsuppose.[N569]    [Footnote N569: Compare Nordenskiöld’s account of the comparative    cleanliness of the Chukch dwellings at Pitlekaj: “On the other    hand it may be stated that in order not to make a stay in the    confined tent chamber too uncomfortable certain rules are strictly    observed. Thus, for instance, it is not permitted in the interior    of the tent to spit on the floor, but this must be done into a    vessel which, in case of necessity, is used as a night utensil. In    every outer tent there lies a specially curved reindeer horn, with    which snow is removed from the clothes; the outer _pesk_ is    usually put off before one goes into the inner tent, and the shoes    are carefully freed from snow. The carpet of walrus skins which    covers the floor of the inner tent is accordingly dry and clean.    Even the outer tent is swept clean and free from loose snow, and    the snow is daily shoveled away from the tent doors with a spade    of whalebone. Every article, both in the outer and inner tent, is    laid in its proper place, and so on.” (Vega, vol. 2, p. 104.)]The contents of this vessel, being mixed with feces, is not fit fortanning skins, etc., and is consequently thrown out doors. The men usea small tub (kuovwĭñ) as a urinal, and the contents of this iscarefully saved. Though the interior of the house is thus kept clean,as much can not be said for its surroundings. All manner of rubbishand filth is simply thrown out upon the ground, without regard todecency or comfort, and this becomes exceedingly offensive when thesnow melts in summer. The only scavengers are the dogs, who greedilydevour old pieces of skin, refuse meat, and even feces. In regard topersonal cleanliness, there is considerable difference betweenindividuals. Some people, especially the poorer women and children,are not only careless about their clothes, going about dressed inragged, greasy, filthy garments, but seldom wash even their faces andhands, much less their whole persons. One of these women, indeed, wasdescribed by her grown-up daughter as “That woman with the black onher nose.”On the other hand most of the wealthier people appear to take pride inbeing neatly clad, and, except when actually engaged in some dirtywork, always have their faces and hands, at least, scrupulously cleanand their hair neatly combed. Even the whole person is sometimeswashed in spite of the scarcity of water. Many are glad to get soap(íɐkăkun) and use it freely. Lieut. Ray says that his two guides,Mû´ñialu and Apaidyào, at the end of a day’s march would never sitdown to supper without washing their faces and hands with soap andwater, and combing their hair, and I recollect that once, when I wentover to the village to get a young man to start with Lieut. Ray on aboat journey, he would not start until he had hunted up a piece ofsoap and washed his face and hands. These people, of course, practicethe usual Eskimo habit of washing themselves with freshly passedurine. This custom arises not only from the scarcity of water and thedifficulty of heating it, but from the fact that the ammonia of theurine is an excellent substitute for soap in removing the grease withwhich the skin necessarily becomes soiled.[N570] This fact is wellknown to our whalemen, who are in the habit of saving their urine towash the oily clothes with. The same habit is practiced by the“Chukches” of eastern Siberia.[N571] All, however, get more or lessshabby and dirty in the summer, when they are living in tents andboats. All are more or less infested with lice, and they are in thehabit of searching each others’ heads for these, which they eat, afterthe fashion of so many other savages. They have also another filthyhabit--that of eating the mucus from the nostrils. A similar practicewas noticed in Greenland by Egede,[N572] who goes on quaintly to say:“Thus they make good the old proverb, ‘What drips from the nose fallsinto the mouth, that nothing may be lost.’”    [Footnote N570: Compare Dall, Alaska, p. 20.]    [Footnote N571: See Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2, p. 104.]    [Footnote N572: Greenland, p. 127.]_Salutation._--We had no opportunity of witnessing any meeting betweenthese people and strange Eskimo, so that it is impossible to tellwhether they practice any particular form of salutation on suchoccasions. We saw nothing of the kind among themselves. White men aresaluted with shouts of “Nakurúk!” (good), and some Eskimo have learnedto shake hands. They no longer practice the common Eskimo salutationof rubbing noses, but say that they once did. Sergt. Middleton Smith,of our party, informs me that he once saw a couple of natives in Capt.Herendeen’s trading store give an exhibition of the way thissalutation was formerly practiced.This custom was perhaps falling into disuse as early as 1837, sinceThomas Simpson,[N573] in describing his reception at Point Barrow,says: “We were not, however, either upon this or any other occasion,favored with the kooniks or nose-rubbing salutations that have soannoyed other travelers.” Mr. Elson, however, expressly states thatthe people, probably Utkiavwĭñmiun, whom he met at Refuge Inlet elevenyears before, rubbed noses and cheeks with him[N574] and Maguire[N575]narrates how the head of the party of visitors from Point Hope salutedhim. He says: “He fixed his forehead against mine and used it as afulcrum to rub noses several times.”    [Footnote N573: Narrative, p. 155.]    [Footnote N574: Beechy’s Voyage p. 312.]    [Footnote N575: N. W. Passage, p. 385.]_Healing._--As is the case with Eskimo generally, these people relyfor curing disease chiefly upon the efforts of certain persons whohave the power of exorcising the supernatural beings by whom thedisease is caused. A large number of men and, I believe, some womenwere supposed to have this power and exercise it in cases of sickness,in some instances, at least, upon the payment of a fee. These peoplecorrespond closely to the angekut of the Greenlanders and EasternEskimo, and the so-called “shamans” of southern Alaska, but, as far aswe could see, do not possess the power and influence usually elsewhereascribed to this class.It was exceedingly difficult to obtain any definite informationconcerning these people, and we only discovered casually that such andsuch a person was a “doctor” by hearing that he had been employed in acertain case of sickness, or to perform some ceremony of incantation.We did not even succeed in learning the name of this class of people,who, in talking with us, would call themselves “tûktĕ,” as they didour surgeon. On one occasion some of the party happened to visit thehouse of a sick man where one of these “doctors” was at work. He satfacing the entrance of the house, beating his drum at intervals, andmaking a babbling noise with his lips, followed by long speechesaddressed to something down the trapdoor, bidding it “go!” We weregiven to understand that these speeches were addressed to a tuɐña orsupernatural being.[N576] Their only idea of direct treatment ofdisease is apparently to apply a counterirritant by scarification ofthe surface of the part affected.    [Footnote N576: Dr. Simpson says (op. cit., p. 275): “Diseases are    also considered to be turn´gaks.”]We know of one case where a sufferer from some liver complaint hadinflicted on himself, or had had inflicted upon him, quite aconsiderable cut on the right side with a view of relieving the pain.We also know of several cases where the patients had themselves cut onthe scalp or back to relieve headache or rheumatism, and one casewhere the latter disorder, I believe, had been treated by a severe cuton the side of the knee. A similar practice has been observed atPlover Bay, Siberia, by Hooper,[N577] who also mentions the use of akind of seton for the relief of headache.    [Footnote N577: Tents, etc., p. 185.]They also practice a sort of rough-and-ready surgery, as in the caseof the man already mentioned, whose feet had both been amputated. Oneof the men who lost the tip of his forefinger by the explosion of acartridge was left with a stump of bone protruding at the end of thefinger. Our surgeon attempted to treat this, but after twounsuccessful trials to etherize the patient he was obliged to give itup. When, however, the young man’s father-in-law, who was a noted“doctor,” came home he said at once that the stump must come off, andthe patient had to submit to the operation without ether. The “doctor”tried to borrow Dr. Oldmixon’s bone forceps, and when these wererefused him cut the bone off, I believe, with a chisel. They appear tohave no cure for blindness. We heard nothing of the curious process of“couching” described by Egede in Greenland, p. 121. We had noopportunity of observing their methods of treating wounds or otherexternal injuries. Sufferers were very glad to be treated by oursurgeon, and eagerly accepted his medicines, though he had considerabledifficulty in making them obey his directions about taking care ofthemselves.After they had been in the habit of receiving the surgeon’s medicinefor some time, one of the Utkiavwĭñ natives gave Capt. Herendeen whathe said was their own medicine. It is a tiny bit of turf which theycalled nuna kĭñmölq, and which, therefore, probably came from thehighland of the upper Meade River, which region bears the name ofKĭñmölq. We were able to get very little information about thissubstance, but my impression is that it was said to be administeredinternally, and I believe was specially recommended for bleeding atthe lungs. Possibly this is the same as “the black moss that grows onthe mountain,” which, according to Crantz[N578] was eaten by theGreenlanders to stop blood-spitting.    [Footnote N578: Vol. 1, p. 235.]CUSTOMS CONCERNING THE DEAD._Abstentions._--From the fact that we did not hear of any of thedeaths until after their occurrence, we were able to learn very few oftheir customs concerning the dead. The few observations we were ableto make agree in the main with those made elsewhere. For instance, welearned with tolerable certainty that the relatives of the dead, atleast, must abstain from working on wood with an ax or hammer for acertain period--I believe, four or five days. According to Dall,[N579]in the region about Norton Sound the men can not cut wood with an axfor five days after a death has occurred. In Greenland the householdof the deceased were obliged to abstain for a while from certain kindsof food and work.[N580]    [Footnote N579: Alaska, p. 146.]    [Footnote N580: Egede, Greenland, p. 150.]A woman from Utkiavwĭñ, who came over to the station one day in theautumn of 1881, declined to sew on clothing, even at our house,because, as she told Lieut. Ray, there was a dead man in the villagewho had not yet been carried out to the cemetery and “he would seeher.” After consulting with her husband, however, she concluded shecould protect herself from him by tracing a circle about her on thefloor with a snow-knife. In this circle she did the sewing required,and was careful to keep all her work inside of it.One of the natives informed me that when a man died his labrets weretaken out and thrown away. I remember, however, seeing a young manwearing a plug labret of syenite, which he said had belonged to an oldman who died early in the winter of 1881-’82. It was perhaps removedbefore he actually died._Manner of disposing of the dead._--The corpse is wrapped up in apiece of sailcloth (deerskin was formerly used), laid upon a flatsled, and dragged out by a small party of people--perhaps theimmediate relatives of the deceased, though we never happened to seeone of these funeral processions except from a distance--to thecemetery, the place where “they sleep on the ground.” This place atUtkiavwĭñ is a rising ground about a mile and a half east of thevillage, near the head of the southwest branch of the Isûtkwa lagoon.At Nuwŭk the main cemetery is at “Nexeurá,” between the village andPernyû. The bodies are laid out upon the ground without any regulararrangement apparently, though it is difficult to be sure of this, asmost of the remains have been broken up and scattered by dogs andfoxes. With a freshly wrapped body it is almost impossible to tellwhich is the head and which the feet. We unfortunately never noticedwhether the heads were laid toward any particular point of thecompass, as has been observed in other localities. Dr. Simpson saysthat the head is laid to the east at Point Barrow.Various implements belonging to the deceased are broken and laidbeside the corpse, and the sled is sometimes broken and laid over it.Sometimes, however, the latter is withdrawn a short distance from thecemetery and left on the tundra for one moon, after which it isbrought back to the village. Most people do not seem to be troubled athaving the bodies of their relatives disturbed by the dogs or otheranimals,[N581] but we know of one case where the parents of twochildren who died very nearly at the same time, finding that the dogswere getting at the bodies, raised them on stages of driftwood about 4or 5 feet high. Similar stages were observed by Hooper at PloverBay;[N582] but this method of disposing of the dead appears to havegone out of use at the present day, since Dall[N583] describes theordinary Siberian method of laying out the dead in ovals of stone asin use at Plover Bay at the time of his visit.    [Footnote N581: Compare Lyon, Journal, p. 269.]    [Footnote N582: Tents, etc., p. 88.]    [Footnote N583: Alaska, p. 382.]The cemetery at Utkiavwĭñ is not confined to the spot I havementioned, though most of the bodies are exposed there. A few bodiesare also exposed on the other side of the lagoon, and one body, thatof a man, was laid out at the edge of the higher tundra, about a miledue east from the station. The body was covered with canvas, stakeddown all round with broken paddles, and over it was laid a flat sledgewith one runner broken.[N584] At one end of the body lay a woodendish, and under the edge of the canvas were broken seal-darts andother spears. The body lay in an east and west line, but we could nottell which end was the head. All sorts of objects were scattered roundthe cemetery--tools, dishes, and even a few guns--though we saw nonethat appeared to have been serviceable when exposed, except one Sniderrifle. If, as is the case among Eskimo in a good many other places,all the personal property of the deceased is supposed to becomeunclean and must be exposed with him, it is probable that his friendsmanage to remove the more valuable articles before he is actuallydead.[N585]    [Footnote N584: Compare Samoyed grave described and figured by    Nordenskiöld (Vega, vol. 1, p. 98), where a broken sledge was laid    upside down by the grave.]    [Footnote N585: Compare Holm, Geografisk Tidskrift, vol. 8, p. 98:    “kun Kostbarheder, saasom Knive eller lignende Jærnsager beholde    den afdødes efterladte.”--East Greenland.]The method of disposing of the dead varies slightly among the Eskimoin different localities, but the weapons or other implements belongingto the deceased are always laid beside the corpse. The custom at SmithSound, as described by Bessels,[N586] is remarkably like that at PointBarrow. The corpse was wrapped in furs, placed on a sledge, anddragged out and buried in the snow with the face to the west. Thesledge was laid over the body and the weapons of the deceased weredeposited beside it. Unlike the Point Barrow natives, however, theyusually cover the body with stones. In the same passage Dr. Besselsdescribes a peculiar symbol of mourning, not employed, so far as I canlearn, elsewhere. The male mourners plugged up the right nostril withhay and the females the left, and these plugs were worn for severaldays. The custom of covering the body with stones appears to beuniversally prevalent east of the Mackenzie region.[N587]    [Footnote N586: Naturalist, vol. 18, pt. 9, p. 877.]    [Footnote N587: See the passage quoted from Bessels, for Smith    Sound; Egede, Greenland, p. 148; Crantz’s History of Greenland,    vol. 1, p. 237; East Greenland, Holm, Geografisk Tidskrift, vol.    8, p. 98, and Scoresby, Voyage to Northern Whalefishery, p. 213    (where he speaks of finding on the east coast of Greenland graves    _dug_ and covered with slabs of stone. _Digging_ graves is very    unusual among the Eskimo, as the nature of the ground on which    they live usually forbids it. Parry mentions something similar at    Iglulik: “The body was laid in a regular, but shallow grave, * * *    covered with flat pieces of limestone” (Second Voyage, p. 551);    Lyon, Journal, p. 268 (Iglulik); Kumlien, Contribution, p. 44    (Cumberland Gulf); Hall, Arctic Researches, p. 124 (Baffin Land);    Rae Narrative, pp. 22 and 187 (northwest shore of Hudson Bay), and    Ellis, Voyage to Hudson’s Bay, p. 148 (Marble Island). I myself    have noticed the same custom at the old Eskimo cemetery near the    Hudson Bay post of Rigolette, Hamilton Inlet, on the Labrador    coast. Chappel, however, saw a body “closely wrapt in skins and    laid in a sort of a gully,” Hudson’s Bay, p. 113 (north shore    Hudson Strait), and Davis’s account of what he saw in Greenland is    as follows: “We found on shore three dead people, and two of them    had their staues lying by them and their olde skins wrapped about    them.” Hakluyt, Voyages, 1589, p. 788.]The bodies seen by Dr. Richardson in the delta of the Mackenzie werewrapped in skins and loosely covered with driftwood,[N588] and asimilar arrangement was noticed at Kotzebue Sound by Beechey, whofigures[N589] a sort of little wigwam of driftwood built over the deadman. At Port Clarence Nordenskiöld[N590] saw two corpses “laid on theground, fully clothed, without protection of any coffin, butsurrounded by a close fence consisting of a number of tent-polesdriven crosswise into the ground. Alongside one of the corpses lay a_kayak_ with oars, a loaded double-barreled gun with locks athalf-cock and caps on, various other weapons, clothes, tinder-box,snowshoes, drinking-vessels, two masks, * * * and strangely shapedanimal figures.” On the Siberian coast the dead are sometimesburned.[N591]    [Footnote N588: Franklin, Second Expedition, p. 192.]    [Footnote N589: Voyage, pl. opposite p. 332.]    [Footnote N590: Vega, vol. 2, p. 238, and figure of grave on    p. 239.]    [Footnote N591: See Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2, p. 88, and Dall,    Alaska, p. 382.]Nordenskiöld believes that the coast Chukches have perhaps begun toabandon the custom of burning the dead, but I am rather inclined tothink that is a custom of the “deermen,” which the people of the coastof pure or mixed Eskimo blood never fully adopted. Dall, indeed, wasexplicitly informed that the custom was only used with the bodies of“good” men, and at the time of Nordenskiöld’s visit he found it “atleast certain that the people of Pitlekaj exclusively bury their deadby laying them out on the tundra.” The body is surrounded by an ovalof stones, but apparently not covered with them as in the east.[N592]The Krause brothers observed by the bodies, besides “die erwähntenGeräthschaften” [Lanzen, Bogen und Pfeile für die Männer, Koch- undHausgeräthe für die Weiber], “unter einen kleinen Steinhaufen einHunde-, Renthier-, Bären- oder Walross-Schädel.” This custom shows acurious resemblance to that described by Egede[N593] in Greenland:“When little Children die and are buried, they put the Head of a Dognear the Grave, fancying that Children, having no Understanding, theycan not by themselves find the Way, but the Dog must guide them to theLand of the Souls.” The body is usually laid out at full length uponthe ground. Among the ancient Greenlanders,[N594] however, and in theYukon region the body was doubled up. In the latter region the bodywas laid on its side in a box of planks four feet long and raised onfour supports[N595] or wrapped up in mats and covered with rocks ordriftwood.[N596] The custom of inclosing the dead in a short coffin,to judge from the figures given by the latter writer in P1. VI. of hisreport, appears also to prevail at the mouth of the Kuskokwim. In theisland of Kadiak, according to Dall and Lisiansky,[N597] the dead wereburied.    [Footnote N592: See Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2, pp. 88-9    (Pitlekaj), and 225 (St. Lawrence Bay); Krause Bros.,    Geographische Blätter, vol. 5, p. 18 (St. Lawrence Bay, East Cape,    Indian Point, and Plover Bay) and Dall, Alaska, p. 382.]    [Footnote N593: Greenland, p. 151. See also Crantz, vol. 1,    p. 237.]    [Footnote N594: Egede, Greenland, p. 149, and Crantz, vol. 1,    p. 287.]    [Footnote N595: Dall, Alaska, pp. 19, 145, and 227.]    [Footnote N596: Petroff, Report, p. 127.]    [Footnote N597: Alaska, p. 403, and Voyage, p. 200.]GOVERNMENT._In the family._--I can hardly do better than quote Dr. Simpson’swords, already referred to (op. cit. page 252), on this subject:“A man seems to have unlimited authority in his own hut.”Nevertheless, his rule seems to be founded on respect and mutualagreement, rather than on despotic authority. The wife appears to beconsulted, as already stated, on all important occasions, and, toquote Dr. Simpson again (ibid.): “Seniority gives precedence whenthere are several women in one hut, and the sway of the elder in thedirection of everything connected with her duties seems neverdisputed.” When more than one family inhabit the same house the headof each family appears to have authority over his own relatives, whilethe relations between the two are governed solely by mutual agreement._In the village._--These people have no established form of governmentnor any chiefs in the ordinary sense of the word, but appear to beruled by a strong public opinion, combined with a certain amount ofrespect for the opinions of the elder people, both men and women, andby a large number of traditional observances like those concerning thewhale fishery, the deceased, etc., already described. In the ordinaryrelations of life a person, as a rule, avoids doing anything to hisneighbor which he would not wish to have done to himself, and affairswhich concern the community as a whole, as for instance theirrelations with us at the station, are settled by a general andapparently informal discussion, when the opinion of the majoritycarries the day. The majority appears to have no means, short ofindividual violence, of enforcing obedience to its decisions, but, asfar as we could see, the matter is left to the good sense of theparties concerned. Respect for the opinions of elders is so great thatthe people may be said to be practically under what is called “simpleelder rule.”[N598] Public opinion has formulated certain rules inregard to some kinds of property and the division of game, which areremarkably like those noticed among Eskimo elsewhere, and which may besupposed to have grown up among the ancestors of the Eskimo, beforetheir separation.    [Footnote N598: Compare, among other instances, Capt. Holm’s    observations in East Greenland: “Som Overhoved i Huset [which is    the village] fungerer den ældeste Mand, naar han er en god Fanger,    etc.” (Geogr. Tids., vol. 8, p. 90.)]For instance, in Greenland,[N599] “Anyone picking up pieces ofdriftwood or goods lost at sea or on land was considered the rightfulowner of them; and to make good his possession he had only to carrythem up above high-water mark and put stones upon them, no matterwhere his homestead might be.” Now, at Point Barrow we often saw thenatives dragging driftwood up to the high-water mark, and the ownerseemed perfectly able to prove his claim. Lieut. Ray informs me thathe has seen men mark such sticks of timber by cutting them with theiradzes and that sticks so marked were respected by the other natives.On one occasion, when he was about to have a large piece ofdrift-timber dragged up to the station, a woman came up and provedthat the timber belonged to her by pointing out the freshly cut mark.I have myself seen a native claim a barrel which had been washedashore, by setting it up on end.    [Footnote N599: Rink, Tales and Traditions, p. 28. Compare also    Crantz, vol. 1, p. 181.]As far as we could learn, the smaller animals, as for instance, birds,the smaller seals, reindeer, etc., are the property of the hunter,instead of being divided as in some other localities, for example atSmith Sound.[N600] The larger seals and walruses appeared to bedivided among the boat’s crew, the owner of the boat apparentlykeeping the tusks of the walrus and perhaps the skin. A bear, however,both flesh and skin, is equally divided among all who in any way had ahand in the killing. We learned this with certainty from having topurchase the skin of a bear killed at the village, where a number ofmen had been engaged in the hunt. When a whale is taken, as I havealready said, the whalebone is equally divided among the crews of allthe boats in sight at the time of killing. All comers, however, have aright to all the flesh, blubber, and blackskin that they can cutoff.[N601]    [Footnote N600: Bessels, Naturalist, vol. 23, pt. p. 873.]    [Footnote N601: Compare Rink, Tales, etc., p. 29: “But if an    animal of the largest size, more especially a whale, was captured,    it was considered common property, and as indiscriminately    belonging to every one who might come and assist in flensing it,    whatever place he belonged to and whether he had any share in    capturing the animal or not.” (Greenland). Gilder (Schwatka’s    Search, p. 190) says that on the northwest shore of Hudson Bay all    who arrive while a walrus is being cut up are entitled to a share    of it, though the man who struck it has the first choice of    pieces. At East Cape, Siberia, the Krause Brothers learned: “Wird    nämlich ein Walfisch gefangen, so hat jeder Ortsbewohner das    Recht, so viel Fleisch zu nehmen, als er abzuschneiden vermag.”    (Geographische Blätter, vol. 5, pt. 2, p. 120).]Dr. Rink, in describing the social order of the ancientGreenlanders,[N602] says: “Looking at what has been said regardingthe rights of property and the division of the people into certaincommunities, in connection with the division of property into theclasses just given, we are led to the conclusion that the right of anyindividual to hold more than a certain amount of property was, if notregulated by law, at least jealously watched by the rest of thecommunity, and that virtually the surplus of any individual orcommunity, fixed by the arbitrary rate which tradition or custom hadassigned, was made over to those who had less.” At Point Barrow,however, the idea of individual ownership appears to be much morestrongly developed. As far as we could learn, there is no limit to theamount of property which an individual, at least the head of a family,may accumulate. Even though the whalebone be, as already described,divided among all the boats’ crews “in at the death,” no objection ismade to one man buying it all up, if he has the means, for his ownprivate use.    [Footnote N602: Tales, etc., p. 29.]This has given rise to a regular wealthy and aristocratic class, who,however, are not yet sufficiently differentiated from the poorerpeople to refuse to associate on any terms but those of socialequality. The men of this class are the umialiks, a word which appearsin many corrupted forms on the coast of Western America and is oftensupposed to mean “chief.” Dr. Simpson[N603] says: “The chief men arecalled O-mé-liks (wealthy),” but “wealthy” is an explanation of theposition of these men, and not a translation of the title, which, aswe obtained it, is precisely the same as the Greenland word for _ownerof a boat_, umialik (from umia(_k_), and the termination lĭk orlĭ-ñ. This is one of the few cases in which the final _k_ is soundedat Point Barrow as in Greenland).    [Footnote N603: Op. cit., p. 272.]Dr. Rink has already observed[N604] that the word used by Simpson “nodoubt must be the same as the Greenlandish umialik, signifying ownerof a boat,” and as I heard the title more than once carefullypronounced at Point Barrow it was the identical word. The umialiks, asSimpson says,[N605] “have acquired their position by being morethrifty and intelligent, better traders, and usually better hunters,as well as physically stronger and more daring.”[N606] They haveacquired a certain amount of influence and respect from these reasons,as well as from their wealth, which enables them to purchase theservices of others to man their boats, but appear to have absolutelyno authority outside of their own families.[N607] Petroff[N608]considers them as a sort of “middlemen or spokesmen,” who makethemselves “prominent by superintending all intercourse and trafficwith visitors.”    [Footnote N604: Tales, etc., p. 25.]    [Footnote N605: Op. cit.]    [Footnote N606: Compare what the Krause Brothers say of the    “chiefs” on the Siberian coast (Geographische Blätter, vol. 5, pt.    1, p. 29): “Die Autorität, welche die obenerwähnten Männer    augenscheinlich ausüben, ist wohl auf Rechnung ihres grösseren    Besitzes zu setzen. Der “Chief” is jedes Mal der reichste Mann,    ein ‘big man.’”]    [Footnote N607: See, also, Dr. Simpson, op. cit., p. 273.]    [Footnote N608: Report, etc., p. 125.]This sort of prominence, however, appears to have been conferred uponthem by the traders, who, ignorant of the very democratic state ofEskimo society, naturally look for “chiefs” to deal with. They pickout the best looking and best dressed man in the village and endeavorto win his favor by giving him presents, receiving him into the cabin,and conducting all their dealings with the natives through him. Thechief, thus selected, is generally shrewd enough to make the most ofthe greatness thrust upon him, and no doubt often pretends to moreinfluence and power than he actually possesses.[N609]    [Footnote N609: Compare the case of the alleged “chiefs” of the    Chukches, in Nordenskiöld’s Vega, vol. 1, pp. 449 and 495.]As to the story of the whalemen, that the “chieftainship” is thereward of the best fighter, who holds it like a “challenge cup,”subject to being called out at any time to defend his rank in a duel,as far as concerns Point Barrow, this is a sheer fable, perhapsinvented by the Eskimo to impose upon the strangers, but more likelythe result of misunderstanding and a vivid imagination on the part ofthe whites. Among umialiks, one or two appear to have more wealth andinfluence than the rest. Tcuñaura in Utkiavwĭñ and the late Katiga atNuwŭk were said, according to Captain Herendeen, to be “greatumialiks” and Tcuñaura was always spoken of as the foremost man inUtkiavwĭñ. We knew of one party coming up from Sidaru with presentsfor Tcuñaura, and were informed that the other Eskimo never sold tohim, but only gave him presents. It was also said that Katiga’s infantson would one day be a “great umialik.”All these men are or have been captains of whaling umiaks, and thetitle umialiks appears to be applied to them in this capacity, sincemany of the poorer men, who, as far as we could learn, were notconsidered umialiks, own umiaks which they do not fit out for whaling,but use only to transport their families from place to place in thesummer.RELIGION._General ideas._--It was exceedingly difficult to get any idea of thereligious belief of the people, partly from our inability to makeourselves understood in regard to abstract ideas and partly fromignorance on our part of the proper method of conducting suchinquiries. For instance, in trying to get at their ideas of a futurelife, we could only ask “Where does a man go when he dies?” to whichwe, of course, received the obvious answer, “To the cemetery!”Moreover, such a multitude of other and easier lines of investigationpresented themselves for our attention that we were naturally inclinedto neglect the difficult field of religion, and besides under thecircumstances of our intercourse it was almost impossible to get theattention of the natives when their minds were not full of othersubjects.Nevertheless, many of the fragments of superstition and tradition thatwe were able to collect agree remarkably with what has been observedamong the Eskimo elsewhere, so that it is highly probable that theirreligion is of the same general character as that of the Greenlanders,namely, a belief in a multitude of supernatural beings, who are to beexorcised or propitiated by various observances, especially by theperformances of certain specially gifted people, who are something ofthe nature of wizards. So much has been written by many authors aboutthese wizards or “doctors,” the angekut of the eastern Eskimo, theso-called “shamans” of Alaska and Siberia, that I need make no specialreference to their writings except where they happen to throw light onour own observations. Dr. Simpson succeeded in obtaining moreinformation concerning the religious belief of these people than ourparty was able to do, and his observations,[N610] to which ours are insome degree supplementary, tend to corroborate the conclusion at whichI have arrived.    [Footnote N610: Op. cit., p. 273 et seq.]Our information in regard to the special class of wizards was rathervague. We learned that many men in the village, distinguishable fromthe rest by no visible characteristics, were able to heal the sick,procure good weather, favorable winds, plenty of game, and do otherthings by “talking” and beating the drum. We did not learn the numberof these men in either village, but we heard of very many differentmen doing one or the other of these things, while others of ouracquaintance never attempted them. Neither did we learn that any oneof these men was considered superior to the rest, as appears to be thecase in some regions, nor how a man could attain this power. Some ofthese men, who appeared to give particular attention to curing thesick, called themselves “tû´ktĕ” (“doctor”), but, probably for want ofproperly directed inquiries, we did not learn the Eskimo name of thesepeople. We were definitely informed, however, that their “talk,” whentreating disease or trying to obtain fair weather, etc., was addressedto “tu´ɐña,” or a supernatural being. This name, of course, differsonly in dialectic form from that applied in other places to theuniversal familiar spirits of Eskimo superstition.We at first supposed that “tuɐña” meant some particular individualdemon, but Dr. Simpson is probably right in saying that the PointBarrow natives, like the rest of the Eskimo, recognize a host oftuɐñain, since “tuɐña” was described to us under a variety of forms.Most of the natives whom we asked if they had seen tuɐña, said thatthey had not, but that other men, mentioning certain “doctors,” hadseen him. One man, however, said that he had seen tuɐña in thekûdyĭgĭ, when the people “talked” sitting in the dark, with theirheads bowed and faces covered, and tuɐña came with a noise like agreat bird.[N611] He had raised his head and saw tuɐña, like a manwith bloodless cheeks.[N612] Tuɐña again was called “a bad man, dead”(apparently a ghost), sometimes as large as a man and sometimesdwarfish, sometimes a fleshless skeleton, while one man, to describehim, made the same grimace that a white man would use to indicate ahobgoblin, with staring eyes, gaping mouth, and hands outstretchedlike claws. Apparently “tuɐña” in conversation with us was used todesignate all the various supernatural objects of their belief, ghostsas well as familiar spirits. For instance, in Greenland, according toRink,[N613] a ghost “manifests himself by whistling or singing in theears.” Now, Lieut. Ray was walking rapidly one day in the winter withan Eskimo and his wife, and the woman suddenly stopped and said she“heard tuɐña”--that he made a noise like _singing in the ears_.    [Footnote N611: Compare Graah’s account of the ceremony of    summoning a _torngak_ in East Greenland (Narrative, p. 123). “Come    he did, however, at last, and his approach was announced by a    strange rushing sound, very like the sound of a _large bird_    flying beneath the roof.” (The italics are my own.) The _angekut_    evidently have some juggling contrivance, carefully concealed from    laymen, perhaps of the nature of a “whizzing-stick.”]    [Footnote N612: Compare Rink’s description of the ceremony of    summoning a tornak to ask his advice, in Greenland (Tales, etc.,    p. 60). This was performed before a company in a darkened house.    The angekok lay on the floor, beside a suspended skin and drum,    with his hands tied behind his back and his head between his legs.    A song was sung by the audience, and the angekok invoked his    tornak, beating on the skin and the drum. The spirit announced his    arrival by a peculiar sound and the appearance of a light or    fire.]    [Footnote N613: Tales, etc., p. 14.]The people generally have a great dread of “tuɐña,” who they say wouldkill them, and are very averse to going out alone in the dark. One ofeach party that came over from the village in the evening usuallycarried a drawn knife, preferably one of the large double-edgedknives, supposed to be Siberian and already described, in his hand asdefense against tuɐña, and a drawn knife was sometimes even carried inthe daylight “nanumunlu tuɐñamunlu,” “for bear and demon.”Notwithstanding their apparently genuine dread of “tuɐña,” they are byno means averse to talking or even joking about him.The knife also serves as a protection against the aurora, which mostof them agree is bad, and when bright likely to kill a person bystriking him in the back of the neck. However, brandishing the knifeat it will keep it off. Besides, as a woman told me one night, you candrive off a “bad” aurora by throwing at it dog’s excrement andurine.[N614]    [Footnote N614: Compare Rink (Tales, etc. p. 56): “Several fetid    and stinking matters, such as old urine, are excellent means for    keeping away all kinds of evil-intentioned spirits and ghosts.”]Lieut. Ray saw in one of the houses in Utkaiwiñ, a contrivance forfrightening away a “tuɐña” from the entrance to a house should he tryto get in. The man had hung in the trapdoor the handle of a seal-dragby means of a thong spiked to the wall with a large knife, and toldLieut. Ray that if “tuɐña” tried to get into the house he wouldundoubtedly catch hold of the handle to help himself up, which wouldpull down the knife upon his head and frighten him off. We never hadan opportunity of witnessing the ceremony of summoning “tuɐña,” nordid we ever hear of the ceremony taking place during our stay at thestation, but we were fortunate enough to observe several otherperformances, though they do not appear to be frequent. The ceremonyof healing the sick and the ceremonies connected with thewhale-fishery have already been described.On the 21st of February, 1883, Lieut. Ray and Capt. Herendeen happenedto be at the village on time to see the tuɐña, who had been causingthe bad weather, expelled from the village. Some of the natives saidthe next day that they had _killed_ the tuɐña, but they said at thesame time he had gone “a long way off.” When Lieut. Ray reached thevillage, women were standing at the doors of the houses armed withsnow-knives and clubs with which they made passes over the entrancewhen the people inside called out. He entered one house and found awoman vigorously driving the tuɐña out of every corner with a knife.They then repaired to the kûdyĭgi, where there were ten or twelvepeople, each of whom, to quote from Lieut. Ray’s note book, “made acharge against the evil spirit, telling what injuries they hadreceived from it.” Then they went into the open air, where a fire hadbeen built in front of the entrance, and formed a half circle aroundthe fire. Each then went up and made a speech, bending over the fire(according to Simpson, who describes a similar ceremony at Nuwŭk onp. 274 of his paper, coaxing the tuɐña to come under the fire to warmhimself). Then they brought out a large tub full of urine, to which,Simpson says, each man present had contributed, and held it ready nearthe fire, while two men stood with their rifles in readiness, and aboy stood near the fire with a large stone in his hands, bracinghimself firmly with his feet spread apart for a vigorous throw. Thenthey chanted as follows (the words of this chant were obtainedafterward by the writer):  Tâk tâk tâk tohâ!  Nìju´a hâ!  He! he! he!  Haiyahe!  Yaiyahe!  Hwi!And instantly the contents of the tub were dashed on the fire, thestone thrown into the embers, and both men discharged their rifles,one into the embers, and one into the cloud of steam as it rose. Thenall brushed their clothes violently and shouted, and the tuɐña waskilled. By a fortunate coincidence, the next day was the finest we hadhad for a long time.Sacrifices are also occasionally made to these supernatural beings asin Greenland “gifts were offered to the inue of certain rocks, capesand ice firths, principally when traveling and passing thoseplaces.”[N615]    [Footnote N615: Rink, Tales, etc., p. 56.]Capt. Herendeen, in the fall of 1882, went to the rivers in companywith one of the “doctors.” When they arrived at the river Kuaru, wherethe latter intended to stay for the fishing, he got out his drum and“talked” for a long time, and breaking off very small pieces oftobacco threw them into the air, crying out, “Tuɐña, tuɐña, I give youtobacco! give me plenty of fish.” When they passed the dead men at thecemetery, he gave them tobacco in the same way, asking them also forfish.[N616] We noticed but few other superstitious observances whichhave not been already described. As in Greenland and elsewhere,superstition requires certain persons to abstain from certain kinds offood. For instance, Mûñialu, and apparently many others, were notpermitted to eat the burbot, another man was denied ptarmigan, and awoman[N617] at Nuwŭk was not allowed to eat “earth food,” that is,anything which grew upon the ground. Lieut. Ray also mentions a manwho was forbidden bear’s flesh.[N618]    [Footnote N616: “When an Innuit passes the place where a relative    has died, he pauses and deposits a piece of meat near by.” Baffin    Land, Hall, Artic Researches, p. 574.]    [Footnote N617: Report Point Barrow Expedition, p. 46.]    [Footnote N618: Compare Rink, Tales, etc., p. 64; Crantz, vol. 1,    p. 215, and Parry, 2d voyage, p. 548: “Seal’s flesh is forbidden,    for instance, in one disease, that of the walrus in the other; the    heart is denied to some, and the liver to others.”]We observed some traces of the superstition concerning the heads ofseals and other marine animals taken in the chase, which has beennoticed elsewhere. Crantz says:[N619] “The heads of seals must not befractured, nor must they be thrown into the sea, but be piled in aheap before the door,[N620] that the souls of the seals may not beenraged and scare their brethren from the coast.” And Capt. Parryfound that at Winter Island they carefully preserved the heads of allthe animals killed during the winter, except two or three of thewalrus which he obtained with great difficulty. The natives told himthat they were to be thrown into the sea in the summer, but at Iglulikthey readily sold them before the summer arrived.[N621]    [Footnote N619: Vol. 1, p. 216.]    [Footnote N620: Beechey saw the skulls of seals and other animals    kept in piles round the houses at Hotham Inlet (Voyage, p. 259).]    [Footnote N621: Second Voyage, p. 510.]I tried very hard to get a full series of skulls from the seals takenat Utkiavwĭñ in the winter of 1882-’83, but though I frequently askedthe natives to bring them over for sale, they never did so, till atlast one young woman promised to bring me all I wanted at the price ofhalf a pound of gunpowder a skull. Nevertheless, she brought over onlytwo or three at that price. We did not observe what was done with theskulls, but frequently observed quantities of the smaller bones of theseals carefully tucked away in the crevices of the ice at somedistance from the shore. We had comparatively little difficulty inobtaining skulls of the walrus, but I observed that the bottom ofTûseráru, the little pond at the edge of the village, was covered withold walrus skulls, as if they had been deposited there for years. Thesuperstition appears to be in full force among the Chukches, who livenear the place where the _Vega_ wintered. Nordenskiöld was unable topurchase a pair of fresh walrus heads at the first village he visited,though the tusks were offered for sale the next day[N622] and atPitlekaj.[N623] “Some prejudice * * * prevented the Chukches fromparting with the heads of the seal, though * * * we offered a highprice for them. ‘Irgatti’ (to-morrow) was the usual answer. But thepromise was never kept.”    [Footnote N622: Vega, vol. 1, p. 435.]    [Footnote N623: Vega, vol. 2, p. 137.]_Amulets._--Like the Greenlanders[N624] and other Eskimos, they placegreat reliance on amulets or talismans, which are carried on theperson, in the boat, or even inserted in weapons, each apparently withsome specific purpose, which indeed we learned in the case of some ofthose in the collection. Like the amulets of the Greenlanders, theyappear to be[N625] “certain animals or things which had belonged to orbeen in contact with certain persons (e.g., the people of ancienttimes, or fortunate hunters) or supernatural beings,” and “objectswhich merely by their appearance recalled the effect expected from theamulet, such as figures of various objects.” To the latter classbelong the rudely flaked flint images of whales, already mentioned,and probably many of the other small images of men and animals alreadydescribed, especially those fitted with holes for strings to hang themup by.    [Footnote N624: John Davis describes the Greenlanders in 1586 as    follows: “They are idolaters, and have images great store, which    they wore about them, and in their boats, which we suppose they    worship.” (Hakluyt, Voyages, etc., 1589, p. 782.)]    [Footnote N625: Rink, Tales, etc., p. 52.]  [Illustration: FIG. 421.--Whale flaked from glass.]The flint whale is a very common amulet, intended, as we understood,to give good luck, in whaling, and is worn habitually by many of themen and boys under the clothes, suspended around the neck by a string.The captain and harpooner of a whaling crew also wear them as pendantson the fillets already described, and on the breast of the jacket. Weobtained five of these objects, all of very nearly the same shape, butof different materials and varying somewhat in size. Fig. 421represents one of these (No. 56703 [208] from Utkiavwĭñ) made of apiece of hard colorless glass, probably a fragment of a ship’s“deadlight.” It is rather roughly flaked into a figure of a “bowhead”whale, 3.4 inches long, as seen from above and very much flattenedwith exaggerated flukes. The flippers were rudely indicated in theoutline, but the left one is broken off.No. 89613 [771] from Utkiavwĭñ is a very similar image, 2.4 incheslong, which perhaps is of the same material, though it may be made ofrock crystal. No. 56707 [159] from Utkiavwĭñ is a very small whale(1.4 inches long), chipped in large flakes out of a water-worn pebbleof smoky quartz, while No. 89577 [939] Fig. 422, from the samevillage, which is a trifle larger (2 inches long), is made of darkcrimson jasper. The large black flint whale, No. 56683 [61], also fromUtkiavwĭñ, which is 3.9 inches long, is the rudest of all the figuresof the whales. It is precisely the shape of the blade of a skinscraper, except for the roughly indicated flukes.  [Illustration: FIG. 422.--Whale flaked from red jasper.]Fig. 423 (No. 89524 [1299] from Utkiavwĭñ) is a rude wooden image ofthe same animal, 3½ inches long, very broad and flat-bellied. It issmoothly carved and has a fragment of sky-blue glass inlaid torepresent the left eye and a bit of iron pyrites for the right. Theflukes have been split wholly off and fastened on with a lashing ofnarrow whalebone passing through a vertical hole in the “small” andround the edge of the flukes. The flukes themselves have been splitacross and appear to have been doweled together. This shows that theowner attached considerable value to the object, or he would not havetaken the trouble to mend it when another could have been so easilywhittled out. In the middle of the belly is an oblong cavity,containing something which probably adds greater power to the charm.What this is can not be seen, as a band of sealskin with the hairshaved off has been shrunk on round the hinder half of the body andsecured by a seam on the right side. A double turn of sinew braid isknotted round the middle of the body, leaving two ends which are tiedtogether in a loop, showing that this object was meant to be attachedsomewhere about the person.  [Illustration: FIG. 423.--Ancient whale amulet, of wood.]To this class also probably belong the skins or pieces of animals wornas amulets, probably with a view of obtaining the powers of theparticular animal, as in so many cases in the stories related inRink’s Tales and Traditions. We frequently saw men wearing at the beltbunches of the claws of the bear or wolverine, or the metacarpal bonesof the wolf.[N626] The head or beak of the gull or raven[N627] is alsoa common personal amulet, and one man wore a small driedflounder.[N628]    [Footnote N626: Parry mentions bones of the wolverine worn as    amulets at Fury and Hecla’s Strait (second voyage, p. 497).]    [Footnote N627: Compare the Greenland story told by Rink (Tales,    etc., p. 195), when the man who has a gull for his amulet is able    to fly home from sea because the gull seeks his prey far out at    sea, while the one whose amulet is a raven can not, because this    bird seeks his prey landward. Such an amulet as the latter would    probably be chosen with a view to making a man a successful deer    hunter.]    [Footnote N628: Compare the Greenland story, where a salmon amulet    makes a man too slippery to be caught by his pursuers. (Rink    Tales, etc., p. 182.)]We collected a number of these animal amulets to be worn on theperson, but only succeeded in learning the special purpose of one ofthem, No. 89532 [1307], from Utkiavwĭñ, which was said to be intendedto give good luck in deer hunting. It is a young unbranched antler ofa reindeer, 6 inches long, and apparently separated from the skull atthe “bur,” with the “velvet” skin still adhering, though most of thehair is worn off except at the tip. A bit of sinew is tied round thebase.No. 89522 [1573], from Utkiavwĭñ, is an amulet consisting of the lastthree joints of the foot of a reindeer fawn, with the skin and hoofand about 1½ inches of tendon attached behind, through a hole in theend of which is knotted about 3 inches of seal thong. No. 89525 [1314]from the same village, is a precisely similar charm. No. 89699 [779]from Utkiavwĭñ, is the subfossil incisor tooth of some ruminant with ahole drilled through the root for a string to hang it up by. It wassaid to be the tooth of the “ug’ru´nû,” a large animal, long extinct.As the natives said, “Here on the land are none, only the bonesremain.” No. 89743 [1110], from Utkiavwĭñ, is a molar tooth of thesame animal, probably, weathered and old, with a hole freshly drilledthrough one root and a long piece of sinew braid with the ends knottedtogether looped into it. There are also in the collection two very oldteeth which probably were inclosed in little sacks of skin and worn asamulets.No. 89698 [1580], from Utkiavwĭñ, is the tusk of a very young walrus,only 2½ inches long, and No. 89452 [1148] from Utkiavwĭñ, is thecanine tooth of a polar bear. No. 56547 [656], from the same village,is a similar tooth.[N629]    [Footnote N629: Compare Kumlien, Contributions, p. 45. “Another    charm of great value to the mother who has a young babe is the    canine tooth of the polar bear. This is used as a kind of clasp to    a seal-skin string, which passes round the body and keeps the    breasts up. Her milk supply cannot fail while she wears this.”    (Cumberland Gulf.)]The only amulet attached to a weapon, which we collected, is thetern’s bill, already alluded to, placed under the whalebone lashing onthe seal-spear, No. 89910 [1694]. Perhaps the idea of this charm isthat the spear should plunge down upon the seal with as sure an aim asthe tern does upon its prey.[N630]    [Footnote N630: Compare the story in Rink’s Tales and Traditions    (p. 445), where the kaiak, which had a piece of sheldrake fastened    into the bow for an amulet, went faster than the sheldrake flies.]A number of amulets of this class are always carried in thewhaling-umiak. I have already mentioned the wolf-skulls, stuffedravens and eagles, fox-tails[N631] and bunches of feathers used forthis purpose. Most of these charms are parts of some rapacious animalor bird, but parts of other animals seem to have some virtue on theseoccasions.    [Footnote N631: Compare Crantz, vol. 1, p. 216. “The boat [for    whaling] must have a fox’s head in front, and the harpoon be    furnished with an eagle’s beak.” The latter statement is    interesting in connection with the tern’s bill on the seal    harpoon, from Point Barrow, already referred to.]For instance, I noticed the axis vertebra of a seal in onewhaling-umiak, and we collected a rudely stuffed skin of a godwit(Limosa lapponica baueri), which, we were informed, was “for whales.”This specimen (No. 89526 [1328], Fig. 424, from Utkiavwĭñ) is soiledand ragged, and has a stick thrust through the neck to hold it out.The neck is wrapped around with a narrow strip of whalebone and somecoarse thread, part of which serves to lash on a slip of wood,apparently to splice the stick inside. A bit of white man’s string ispassed around the body and tied in a loop to hang it up by. This charmis perhaps to keep the boat from capsizing, since Crantz says that theGreenlanders “like to fasten to their kajak a model of it * * * oronly a dead sparrow or snipe, or a bit of wood, stone, some feathersor hair, that they may not overset” (vol. 1, p. 216), and perhaps thebone of a marine animal, like the seal, is to protect the crew fromdrowning should the boat upset, after all.No. 89529 [1150] from Utkiavwĭñ is a bunch of feathers to be carriedin the boat. It consists of nine wing feathers of the golden eagle,four tied in a bunch with a bit of sinew round the quills, four tiedup with one end of the short bit of seal thong which serves to tie thewhole bundle together, one of which has all the light-colored parts ofthe feather stained with red ocher, and a single feather shaftcarefully wrapped up in a piece of entrail and wound spirally with apiece of sinew braid.  [Illustration: FIG. 424.--Amulet of whaling; stuffed godwit.]No. 89527-8 [1327] from Utkiavwĭñ is the charm which will secure goodsuccess in deerhunting if it is hung up outside of the snow house inwhich the family is encamped. It consists of two roughly stuffed skinsof the black bellied plover (Charadrius squatarola), each with a stickrun through the body so that one end supports the neck and the otherthe tail, and the necks wound with sinew. One has no head. A string ofsinew braid is tied around the body of each, so as to leave a free endat the back, to which is fastened a little cross piece of bone, bywhich it may be secured to a becket. Like the rest of the amulets inthe collection this has evidently seen service, being very old, worn,and faded.The other class of amulets, namely objects which have belonged to orbeen in contact with certain persons or supernatural beings, or I mayadd apparently certain localities, is represented by a number ofspecimens. To the custom of using such things as amulets, weundoubtedly owe the preservation of most of the ancient weapons andother implements, especially those made of wood, bone, or otherperishable substances, like the ancient harpoon heads alreadydescribed, one of which, No. 89544 [1419], is still attached to thebelt on which it was worn.  [Illustration: FIG. 425.--Amulet consisting of ancient jade adz.]Fig. 425, No. 56668 [308], from Utkiavwĭñ is one of the ancient blackjade adzes 5.1 inches, slung with thong and whalebone, making a becketby which it can be hung up. We did not learn the history of thisamulet, which at the time of collecting it was supposed to be a netsinker. There would, however, be no reason for using so valuable anobject for such a purpose, when a common beach pebble would do just aswell, unless it was intended as a charm to insure success in fishing.It may even have been carried as a charm on the person, since weafterwards saw a still more bulky object used for such a purpose.Such an object seems rather heavy to be carried on the person, but awell known man in Utkiavwĭñ always carried with him when he wentsealing a large pear-shaped stone, which must have weighed upwards oftwo pounds, suspended somewhere about his person. It is not unlikelythat this stone acquired its virtue as an amulet from having been asinker used by some lucky fisherman in former time or in a distantcountry. Mr. H. W. Henshaw has already referred to the resemblance ofthis amulet to the plummet-like “medicine stones” of some of ourIndians.[N632]    [Footnote N632: American Journal of Archaeology, vol. 1.]  [Illustration: FIG. 426.--Little box containing amulet for whaling.]Fig. 426, (No. 89534 [1306] from Utkiavwĭñ) is an amulet for successin whaling. It consists of three little irregular water-worn fragmentsof amber carefully wrapped in a bit of parchment and inclosed in alittle wooden box 1½ inches long, made of two semicylindrical bits ofcottonwood, with the flat faces hollowed out and put together andfastened up by three turns of sinew braid round the middle, tied in aloose knot. The box is old and brown from age and handling. We heardof other pieces of amber and earth (“nuna”) worn as amulets, wrappedup in bits of leather and hung on the belt.  [Illustration: FIG. 427.--Amulet for catching fowl with bolas.]No. 89533 [1247], from Utkiavwĭñ, is simply a nearly square pebble,1.4 inches long, of dark red jasper, slung in a bit of sinew braid sothat it can be hung on the belt. Fig. 427 (No. 89525 [1308] fromUtkiavwĭñ) is some small object, placed in the center of the grainside of a square bit of white sealskin, the edges of which are foldedup around it and tied tightly round with deer sinew, so as to make alittle round knob. I collected this amulet, and was particularlyinformed how it was to be used. If it be fastened on the rightshoulder it will insure success in taking ducks with the “bolas.” Fig.428 (No. 89535 [1244] from Utkiavwĭñ) is an amulet whose history wedid not learn. It is a little oblong box 3.3 inches long, carved froma block of cottonwood, with a flat cover tied on with nine turns ofsinew braid, and contains twenty-one dried humble-bees, which it wassaid came from the river Kulugrua. The natives have a great dread,apparently superstitious, of these bees and the large gadflies (Œstenstarandi), one of which I have seen scatter half a dozen people. A manone day caught one of these, and whittled out a little box of wood, inwhich he shut the insect up and tied it up with a shred of sinew,telling Capt. Herendeen that it was “tuɐñamun,” for “tuɐña.”  [Illustration: FIG. 428.--Box of dried bees--amulet.]A small lump of indurated gravel (No. 56725) [273] was one day broughtover from Utkiavwĭñ, with the story that it was a “medicine” fordriving away the ice. The man who uses this charm stands on the highbank at the village, and breaking off grains of the gravel throws themseaward. This will cause the ice to move off from the shore.The essential identity of the amulets of the Point Barrow natives withthose used by the Eskimo elsewhere is shown by the following passagesfrom other writers. Egede says:[N633]  A Superstition very common among them is to load themselves with  Amulets or Pomanders, dangling about their Necks and Arms, which  consist in some Pieces of old Wood, Stones or Bones, Bills and Claws  of Birds, or Anything else which their Fancy suggests to them.    [Footnote N633: Greenland, p. 194.]Crantz says:[N634]  They are so different in the amulets or charms they hang on people,  that one laughs at another’s. These powerful preventives consist in  a bit of old wood hung around their necks, or a stone, or a bone, or  a beak or claw of a bird, or else a leather strap tied round their  forehead, breast, or arm.    [Footnote N634: History of Greenland, vol. I, p. 216.]Parry speaks[N635] of what he supposes were amulets at Iglulik,consisting of teeth of the fox, wolf, and musk-ox, bones of the“kablĕĕarioo” (supposed to be the wolverine), and foxes’ noses.Kumlien says[N636] that at Cumberland Gulf, “among the manysuperstitious notions, the wearing of charms about the person is oneof the most curious. These are called _angoouk_ or _amusit_, and maybe nothing but pieces of bone or wood, birds’ bills or claws, or ananimal’s teeth or skin.” A little girl “had a small envelope ofsealskin that was worn on the back of her inside jacket” containingtwo small stones.    [Footnote N635: Second voyage, p. 497.]    [Footnote N636: Contributions, p. 45.]Such little pockets of skin sewed to the inner jacket are very commonat Point Barrow, but we did not succeed in any case in learning theircontents. At Kotzebue Sound, Beechey saw ravens’ skins on which thenatives set a high value, while the beaks and claws of these birdswere attached to their belts and headbands.[N637] Petitotdescribes[N638] the amulets used in the Mackenzie district, in thepassage already quoted, as “défroques empaillées de corbeau, de fauconou d’hermine.” It is not likely that the use of these is confined tothe women, as his words, “Elles y portent,” would seem to imply. Amongthe sedentary Chukches of Siberia amulets were seen consisting ofwooden forks and wood or ivory carvings.[N639] A wolf’s skull, hung upby a thong; the skin, together with the whole cartilaginous portion ofa wolf’s nose, and a flat stone, are also mentioned.[N640] Capt. Holmalso found wonderfully similar customs among the East Greenlanders. Hesays,[N641] “bære alle Folk Amuletter af de mest forskjelligartedeTing” to guard against sickness and to insure long life, and also forspecific purposes. The men wear them slung round the neck or tiedround the upper arm, the women in their knot of hair or “i Snippenforan paa Pelsen.”    [Footnote N637: Voyage, p. 333.]    [Footnote N638: Monographie, etc., p. xv.]    [Footnote N639: Nordenskiöld, Vega, vol. 2, p. 126.]    [Footnote N640: Vega, vol. 1, p. 503.]    [Footnote N641: Geografisk Tidskrift, vol. 8, p. 94.]INDEX.A.
