    _The lonely sunsets flare forlorn
      Down valleys dreadly desolate;
    The lordly mountains soar in scorn,
      As still as death, as stern as fate._

          _The lonely sunsets flame and die;
            The giant valleys gulp the night;
          The monster mountains scrape the sky,
            Where eager stars are diamond-bright._

    _So gaunt against the gibbous moon,
      Piercing the silence velvet-piled,
    A lone wolf howls his ancient rune,
      The fell arch-spirit of the Wild._

          _O outcast land! O leper land!
            Let the lone wolf-cry all express--
          The hate insensate of thy hand,
            Thy heart's abysmal loneliness._

Songs of a Sourdough




THE LAW OF THE YUKON


    This is the law of the Yukon, and ever she makes it plain:
    "Send not your foolish and feeble; send me your strong and your sane.
    Strong for the red rage of battle; sane, for I harry them sore;
    Send me men girt for the combat, men who are grit to the core;
    Swift as the panther in triumph, fierce as the bear in defeat,
    Sired of a bulldog parent, steeled in the furnace heat.
    Send me the best of your breeding, lend me your chosen ones;
    Them will I take to my bosom, them will I call my sons;
    Them will I gild with my treasure, them will I glut with my meat;
    But the others--the misfits, the failures--I trample under my feet.
    Dissolute, damned, and despairful, crippled and palsied and slain,
    Ye would send me the spawn of your gutters--Go! take back your spawn
          again.

    "Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway;
    From my ruthless throne I have ruled alone for a million years and a
          day;
    Hugging my mighty treasure, waiting for man to come:
    Till he swept like a turbid torrent, and after him swept--the scum.
    The pallid pimp of the dead-line, the enervate of the pen,
    One by one I weeded them out, for all that I sought was--Men.
    One by one I dismayed them, frighting them sore with my glooms;
    One by one I betrayed them unto my manifold dooms.
    Drowned them like rats in my rivers, starved them like curs on my
          plains,
    Rotted the flesh that was left them, poisoned the blood in their veins;
    Burst with my winter upon them, searing forever their sight,
    Lashed them with fungus-white faces, whimpering wild in the night;
    Staggering blind through the storm-whirl, stumbling mad through the
          snow,
    Frozen stiff in the ice pack, brittle and bent like a bow;
    Featureless, formless, forsaken, scented by wolves in their flight,
    Left for the wind to make music through ribs that are glittering white;
    Gnawing the black crust of failure, searching the pit of despair,
    Crooking the toe in the trigger, trying to patter a prayer;
    Going outside with an escort, raving with lips all afoam;
    Writing a cheque for a million, drivelling feebly of home;
    Lost like a louse in the burning ... or else in tented town
    Seeking a drunkard's solace, sinking and sinking down;
    Steeped in the slime at the bottom, dead to a decent world,
    Lost 'mid the human flotsam, far on the frontier hurled;
    In the camp at the bend of the river, with its dozen saloons aglare,
    Its gambling dens a-riot, its gramophones all a-blare;
    Crimped with the crimes of a city, sin-ridden and bridled with lies,
    In the hush of my mountained vastness, in the flush of my midnight
          skies.
    Plague-spots, yet tools of my purpose, so natheless I suffer them
          thrive,
    Crushing my Weak in their clutches, that only my Strong may survive.

    "But the others, the men of my mettle, the men who would 'stablish
          my fame,
    Unto its ultimate issue, winning me honour, not shame;
    Searching my uttermost valleys, fighting each step as they go,
    Shooting the wrath of my rapids, scaling my ramparts of snow;
    Ripping the guts of my mountains, looting the beds of my creeks,
    Them will I take to my bosom, and speak as a mother speaks.
    I am the land that listens, I am the land that broods;
    Steeped in eternal beauty, crystalline waters and woods.
    Long have I waited lonely, shunned as a thing accurst,
    Monstrous, moody, pathetic, the last of the lands and the first;
    Visioning camp-fires at twilight, sad with a longing forlorn,
    Feeling my womb o'er-pregnant with the seed of cities unborn.
    Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway,
    And I wait for the men who will win me--and I will not be won in a day;
    And I will not be won by weaklings, subtile, suave, and mild,
    But by men with the hearts of vikings, and the simple faith of a child;
    Desperate, strong, and resistless, unthrottled by fear or defeat,
    Them will I gild with my treasure, them will I glut with my meat.

    "Lofty I stand from each sister land, patient and wearily wise,
    With the weight of a world of sadness in my quiet, passionless eyes;
    Dreaming alone of a people, dreaming alone of a day,
    When men shall not rape my riches, and curse me and go away;
    Making a bawd of my bounty, fouling the hand that gave--
    Till I rise in my wrath and I sweep on their path and I stamp them
          into a grave.
    Dreaming of men who will bless me, of women esteeming me good,
    Of children born in my borders, of radiant motherhood;
    Of cities leaping to stature, of fame like a flag unfurled,
    As I pour the tide of my riches in the eager lap of the world."

    This is the Law of the Yukon, that only the Strong shall thrive;
    That surely the Weak shall perish, and only the Fit survive.
    Dissolute, damned, and despairful, crippled and palsied and slain,
    This is the Will of the Yukon,--Lo! how she makes it plain!




THE PARSON'S SON


    _This is the song of the parson's son, as he squats in his shack alone,
    On the wild, weird nights when the Northern Lights shoot up from the
          frozen zone,
    And it's sixty below, and couched in the snow the hungry huskies moan._

    "I'm one of the Arctic brotherhood, I'm an old-time pioneer.
    I came with the first--O God! how I've cursed this Yukon--but still
          I'm here.
    I've sweated athirst in its summer heat, I've frozen and starved in
          its cold;
    I've followed my dreams by its thousand streams, I've toiled and
          moiled for its gold.

    "Look at my eyes--been snow-blind twice; look where my foot's half
          gone;
    And that gruesome scar on my left cheek where the frost-fiend bit to
          the bone.
    Each one a brand of this devil's land, where I've played and I've
          lost the game,
    A broken wreck with a craze for 'hooch,' and never a cent to my name.

    "This mining is only a gamble, the worst is as good as the best;
    I was in with the bunch and I might have come out right on top with
          the rest;
    With Cormack, Ladue and Macdonald--O God! but it's hell to think
    Of the thousands and thousands I've squandered on cards and women
          and drink.

    "In the early days we were just a few, and we hunted and fished around,
    Nor dreamt by our lonely camp-fires of the wealth that lay under the
          ground.
    We traded in skins and whiskey, and I've often slept under the shade
    Of that lone birch-tree on Bonanza, where the first big find was made.

    "We were just like a great big family, and every man had his squaw,
    And we lived such a wild, free, fearless life beyond the pale of the
          law;
    Till sudden there came a whisper, and it maddened us every man,
    And I got in on Bonanza before the big rush began.

    "Oh, those Dawson days, and the sin and the blaze, and the town all
          open wide!
    (If God made me in His likeness, sure He let the devil inside.)
    But we all were mad, both the good and the bad, and as for the
          women, well--
    No spot on the map in so short a space has hustled more souls to hell.

    "Money was just like dirt there, easy to get and to spend.
    I was all caked in on a dance-hall jade, but she shook me in the end.
    It put me queer, and for near a year I never drew sober breath,
    Till I found myself in the bughouse ward with a claim staked out on
          death.

    "Twenty years in the Yukon, struggling along its creeks;
    Roaming its giant valleys, scaling its god-like peaks;
    Bathed in its fiery sunsets, fighting its fiendish cold,
    Twenty years in the Yukon ... twenty years--and I'm old.

    "Old and weak, but no matter, there's 'hooch' in the bottle still.
    I'll hitch up the dogs to-morrow, and mush down the trail to Bill.
    It's so long dark, and I'm lonesome--I'll just lay down on the bed,
    To-morrow I'll go ... to-morrow ... I guess I'll play on the red.

    "... Come, Kit, your pony is saddled. I'm waiting, dear, in the
          court ...
    ... Minnie, you devil, I'll kill you if you skip with that flossy
          sport ...
    ... How much does it go to the pan, Bill?... play up, School, and
          play the game ...
    ... Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name ..."

    _This was the song of the parson's son, as he lay in his bunk alone,
    Ere the fire went out and the cold crept in, and his blue lips
          ceased to moan,
    And the hunger-maddened malamutes had torn him flesh from bone._




THE SPELL OF THE YUKON


    I wanted the gold, and I sought it;
      I scrabbled and mucked like a slave.
    Was it famine or scurvy--I fought it,
      I hurled my youth into the grave.
    I wanted the gold and I got it--
      Came out with a fortune last fall,--
    Yet somehow life's not what I thought it,
      And somehow the gold isn't all.

    No! There's the land. (Have you seen it?)
      It's the cussedest land that I know,
    From the big, dizzy mountains that screen it,
      To the deep, deathlike valleys below.
    Some say God was tired when He made it;
      Some say it's a fine land to shun;
    Maybe: but there's some as would trade it
      For no land on earth--and I'm one.

    You come to get rich (damned good reason),
      You feel like an exile at first;
    You hate it like hell for a season,
      And then you are worse than the worst.
    It grips you like some kinds of sinning;
      It twists you from foe to a friend;
    It seems it's been since the beginning;
      It seems it will be to the end.

    I've stood in some mighty-mouthed hollow
      That's plumb-full of hush to the brim;
    I've watched the big, husky sun wallow
      In crimson and gold, and grow dim,
    Till the moon set the pearly peaks gleaming,
      And the stars tumbled out, neck and crop;
    And I've thought that I surely was dreaming,
      With the peace o' the world piled on top.

    The summer--no sweeter was ever;
      The sunshiny woods all athrill;
    The grayling aleap in the river,
      The bighorn asleep on the hill.
    The strong life that never knows harness;
      The wilds where the caribou call;
    The freshness, the freedom, the farness--
      O God! how I'm stuck on it all.

    The winter! the brightness that blinds you,
      The white land locked tight as a drum,
    The cold fear that follows and finds you,
      The silence that bludgeons you dumb.
    The snows that are older than history,
      The woods where the weird shadows slant;
    The stillness, the moonlight, the mystery,
      I've bade 'em good-bye--but I can't.

    There's a land where the mountains are nameless,
      And the rivers all run God knows where;
    There are lives that are erring and aimless,
      And deaths that just hang by a hair;
    There are hardships that nobody reckons;
      There are valleys unpeopled and still;
    There's a land--oh, it beckons and beckons,
      And I want to go back--and I will.

    They're making my money diminish;
      I'm sick of the taste of champagne.
    Thank God! when I'm skinned to a finish
      I'll pike to the Yukon again.
    I'll fight--and you bet it's no sham-fight;
      It's hell!--but I've been there before;
    And it's better than this by a damsite--
      So me for the Yukon once more.

    There's gold, and it's haunting and haunting;
      It's luring me on as of old;
    Yet it isn't the gold that I'm wanting,
      So much as just finding the gold.
    It's the great, big, broad land 'way up yonder,
      It's the forests where silence has lease;
    It's the beauty that thrills me with wonder,
      It's the stillness that fills me with peace.




THE CALL OF THE WILD


    Have you gazed on naked grandeur where there's nothing else to gaze on,
      Set pieces and drop-curtain scenes galore,
    Big mountains heaved to heaven, which the blinding sunsets blazon,
      Black canyons where the rapids rip and roar?
    Have you swept the visioned valley with the green stream streaking
          through it,
      Searched the Vastness for a something you have lost?
    Have you strung your soul to silence? Then for God's sake go and do it;
      Hear the challenge, learn the lesson, pay the cost.

    Have you wandered in the wilderness, the sage-brush desolation,
      The bunch-grass levels where the cattle graze?
    Have you whistled bits of rag-time at the end of all creation,
      And learned to know the desert's little ways?
    Have you camped upon the foothills, have you galloped o'er the ranges,
      Have you roamed the arid sun-lands through and through?
    Have you chummed up with the mesa? Do you know its moods and changes?
      Then listen to the wild--it's calling you.

    Have you known the Great White Silence, not a snow-gemmed twig
          a-quiver?
      (Eternal truths that shame our soothing lies.)
    Have you broken trail on snowshoes? mushed your huskies up the river,
      Dared the unknown, led the way, and clutched the prize?
    Have you marked the map's void spaces, mingled with the mongrel races,
      Felt the savage strength of brute in every thew?
    And though grim as hell the worst is, can you round it off with curses?
      Then hearken to the wild--it's wanting you.

    Have you suffered, starved, and triumphed grovelled, down, yet
          grasped at glory,
      Grown bigger in the bigness of the whole?
    "Done things" just for the doing, letting babblers tell the story,
      Seeing through the nice veneer the naked soul?
    Have you seen God in His splendours, heard the text that nature
          renders?
      (You'll never hear it in the family pew.)
    The simple things, the true things, the silent men who do things--
      Then listen to the wild--it's calling you.

    They have cradled you in custom, they have primed you with their
          preaching,
      They have soaked you in convention through and through;
    They have put you in a showcase; you're a credit to their teaching--
      But can't you hear the wild?--it's calling you.
    Let us probe the silent places, let us seek what luck betide us;
      Let us journey to a lonely land I know.
    There's a whisper on the night-wind, there's a star agleam to guide us,
      And the wild is calling, calling ... let us go.




THE LONE TRAIL


    _Ye who know the Lone Trail fain would follow it,
    Though it lead to glory or the darkness of the pit.
    Ye who take the Lone Trail, bid your love good-bye;
    The Lone Trail, the Lone Trail follow till you die._

    The trails of the world be countless, and most of the trails be tried;
    You tread on the heels of the many, till you come where the ways
          divide;
    And one lies safe in the sunlight, and the other is dreary and wan,
    Yet you look aslant at the Lone Trail, and the Lone Trail lures you on.
    And somehow you're sick of the highway, with its noise and its easy
          needs,
    And you seek the risk of the by-way, and you reck not where it leads.
    And sometimes it leads to the desert, and the tongue swells out of
          the mouth,
    And you stagger blind to the mirage, to die in the mocking drouth.
    And sometimes it leads to the mountain, to the light of the lone
          camp-fire,
    And you gnaw your belt in the anguish of hunger-goaded desire.
    And sometimes it leads to the Southland, to the swamp where the
          orchid glows,
    And you rave to your grave with the fever, and they rob the corpse
          for its clothes.
    And sometimes it leads to the Northland, and the scurvy softens your
          bones,
    And your flesh dints in like putty, and you spit out your teeth like
          stones.
    And sometimes it leads to a coral reef in the wash of a weedy sea,
    And you sit and stare at the empty glare where the gulls wait greedily.
    And sometimes it leads to an Arctic trail, and the snows where your
          torn feet freeze,
    And you whittle away the useless clay, and crawl on your hands and
          knees.
    Often it leads to the dead-pit; always it leads to pain;
    By the bones of your brothers ye know it, but oh, to follow you're
          fain.
    By your bones they will follow behind you, till the ways of the
          world are made plain.

    _Bid good-bye to sweetheart, bid good-bye to friend;
    The Lone Trail, the Lone Trail follow to the end.
    Tarry not, and fear not, chosen of the true;
    Lover of the Lone Trail, the Lone Trail waits for you._




THE HEART OF THE SOURDOUGH


    There where the mighty mountains bare their fangs unto the moon;
    There where the sullen sun-dogs glare in the snow-bright, bitter noon,
    And the glacier-gutted streams sweep down at the clarion call of June:

    There where the livid tundras keep their tryst with the tranquil snows;
    There where the Silences are spawned, and the light of hell-fire flows
    Into the bowl of the midnight sky, violet, amber, and rose:

    There where the rapids churn and roar, and the ice-floes bellowing run;
    Where the tortured, twisted rivers of blood rush to the setting sun--
    I've packed my kit and I'm going, boys, ere another day is done.

           *       *       *       *       *

    I knew it would call, or soon or late, as it calls the whirring wings;
    It's the olden lure, it's the golden lure, it's the lure of the
          timeless things;
    And to-night, O God of the trails untrod, how it whines in my
          heart-strings!

    I'm sick to death of your well-groomed gods, your make-believe and
          your show;
    I long for a whiff of bacon and beans, a snug shake-down in the snow,
    A trail to break, and a life at stake, and another bout with the foe;

    With the raw-ribbed Wild that abhors all life, the wild that would
          crush and rend;
    I have clinched and closed with the naked North, I have learned to
          defy and defend;
    Shoulder to shoulder we've fought it out--yet the Wild must win in
          the end.

    I have flouted the Wild. I have followed its lure, fearless,
          familiar, alone;
    By all that the battle means and makes I claim that land for mine own;
    Yet the Wild must win, and a day will come when I shall be overthrown.

    Then when as wolf-dogs fight we've fought, the lean wolf-land and I;
    Fought and bled till the snows are red under the reeling sky;
    Even as lean wolf-dog goes down will I go down and die.




THE THREE VOICES


    The waves have a story to tell me,
      As I lie on the lonely beach;
    Chanting aloft in the pine-tops,
      The wind has a lesson to teach;
    But the stars sing an anthem of glory
      I cannot put into speech.

    The waves tell of ocean spaces,
      Of hearts that are wild and brave,
    Of populous city places,
      Of desolate shores they lave;
    Of men who sally in quest of gold
      To sink in an ocean grave.

    The wind is a mighty roamer;
      He bids me keep me free,
    Clean from the taint of the gold-lust,
      Hardy and pure as he;
    Cling with my love to nature
      As a child to the mother-knee.

    But the stars throng out in their glory,
      And they sing of the God in man;
    They sing of the mighty Master,
      Of the loom His fingers span;
    Where a star or a soul is a part of the whole,
      And weft in the wondrous plan.

    Here by the camp-fire's flicker,
      Deep in my blanket curled,
    I long for the peace of the pine-gloom
      When the scroll of the Lord is unfurled,
    And the wind and the wave are silent,
      And world is singing to world.




THE PINES


    We sleep in the sleep of ages, the bleak, barbarian pines;
    The grey moss drapes us like sages, and closer we lock our lines,
    And deeper we clutch through the gelid gloom where never a sunbeam
          shines.

    On the flanks of the storm-gored ridges are our black battalions
          massed;
    We surge in a host to the sullen coast, and we sing in the ocean blast;
    From empire of sea to empire of snow we grip our empire fast.

    To the niggard lands were we driven; 'twixt desert and foe are we
          penned.
    To us was the Northland given, ours to stronghold and defend;
    Ours till the world be riven in the crash of the utter end.

    Ours from the bleak beginning, through the æons of death-like sleep;
    Ours from the shock when the naked rock was hurled from the hissing
          deep;
    Ours through the twilight ages of weary glacier-creep.

    Wind of the East, wind of the West, wandering to and fro,
    Chant your songs in our topmost boughs, that the sons of men may know
    The peerless pine was the first to come, and the pine will be last
          to go!

    We pillar the halls of perfumed gloom; we plume where the eagles soar;
    The North-wind swoops from the brooding Pole, and our ancients crash
          and roar;
    But where one falls from the crumbling walls shoots up a hardy score.

    We spring from the gloom of the canyon's womb; in the valley's lap
          we lie;
    From the white foam-fringe where the breakers cringe to the peaks
          that tusk the sky
    We climb, and we peer in the crag-locked mere that gleams like a
          golden eye,--

    Gain to the verge of the hog-back ridge where the vision ranges free:
    Pines and pines and the shadow of pines as far as the eye can see;
    A steadfast legion of stalwart knights in dominant empery.

    Sun, moon and stars, give answer; shall we not staunchly stand
    Even as now, forever, wards of the wilder strand,
    Sentinels of the stillness, lords of the last lone land!




THE HARPY


    _There was a woman, and she was wise; woefully wise was she;
    She was old, so old, yet her years all told were but a score and three;
    And she knew by heart, from finish to start, the Book of Iniquity._

    There is no hope for such as I, on earth nor yet in Heaven;
    Unloved I live, unloved I die, unpitied, unforgiven;
    A loathèd jade I ply my trade, unhallowed and unshriven.

    I paint my cheeks, for they are white, and cheeks of chalk men hate;
    Mine eyes with wine I make to shine, that men may seek and sate;
    With overhead a lamp of red I sit me down and wait.

    Until they come, the nightly scum, with drunken eyes aflame;
    Your sweethearts, sons, ye scornful ones--'tis I who know their shame;
    The gods ye see are brutes to me--and so I play my game.

    For life is not the thing we thought, and not the thing we plan;
    And woman in a bitter world must do the best she can;
    Must yield the stroke, and bear the yoke, and serve the will of man;

    Must serve his need and ever feed the flame of his desire;
    Though be she loved for love alone, or be she loved for hire;
    For every man since life began is tainted with the mire.

    And though you know he love you so, and set you on love's throne,
    Yet let your eyes but mock his sighs, and let your heart be stone,
    Lest you be left (as I was left) attainted and alone.

    From love's close kiss to hell's abyss is one sheer flight, I trow;
    And wedding-ring and bridal bell are will-o'-wisps of woe;
    And 'tis not wise to love too well, and this all women know.

    Wherefore, the wolf-pack having gorged upon the lamb, their prey,
    With siren smile and serpent guile I make the wolf-pack pay;
    With velvet paws and flensing claws, a tigress roused to slay.

    One who in youth sought truest truth, and found a devil's lies;
    A symbol of the sin of man, a human sacrifice:
    Yet shall I blame on man the shame? Could it be otherwise?

    Was I not born to walk in scorn where others walk in pride?
    The Maker marred, and evil-starred I drift upon His tide;
    And He alone shall judge His own, so I His judgment bide.

    _Fate has written a tragedy; its name is "The Human Heart."
    The theatre is the House of Life, Woman the mummer's part:
    The Devil enters the prompter's box and the play is ready to start._




THE LURE OF LITTLE VOICES


    There's a cry from out the Loneliness--Oh, listen, Honey, listen!
      Do you hear it, do you fear it, you're a-holding of me so?
    You're a-sobbing in your sleep, dear, and your lashes, how they
          glisten--
      Do you hear the Little Voices all a-begging me to go?

    All a-begging me to leave you. Day and night they're pleading, praying,
      On the North-wind, on the West-wind, from the peak and from the
          plain;
    Night and day they never leave me--do you know what they are saying?
      "He was ours before you got him, and we want him once again."

    Yes, they're wanting me, they're haunting me, the awful lonely places;
      They're whining and they're whimpering as if each had a soul;
    They're calling from the wilderness, the vast and god-like spaces,
      The stark and sullen solitudes that sentinel the Pole.

    They miss my little camp-fires, ever brightly, bravely gleaming
      In the womb of desolation where was never man before;
    As comradeless I sought them, lion-hearted, loving, dreaming;
      And they hailed me as a comrade, and they loved me evermore.

    And now they're all a-crying, and it's no use me denying:
      The spell of them is on me and I'm helpless as a child;
    My heart is aching, aching, but I hear them sleeping, waking;
      It's the Lure of Little Voices, it's the mandate of the Wild.

    I'm afraid to tell you, Honey, I can take no bitter leaving;
      But softly in the sleep-time from your love I'll steal away.
    Oh, it's cruel, dearie, cruel, and it's God knows how I'm grieving;
      But His Loneliness is calling and He knows I must obey.




THE SONG OF THE WAGE-SLAVE


    When the long, long day is over, and the Big Boss gives me my pay,
    I hope that it won't be hell-fire, as some of the parsons say.
    And I hope that it won't be heaven, with some of the parsons I've met--
    All I want is just quiet, just to rest and forget.
    Look at my face, toil-furrowed; look at my calloused hands;
    Master, I've done Thy bidding, wrought in Thy many lands--
    Wrought for the little masters, big-bellied they be, and rich;
    I've done their desire for a daily hire, and I die like a dog in a
          ditch.
    I have used the strength Thou hast given, Thou knowest I did not shirk;
    Threescore years of labour--Thine be the long day's work.
    And now, Big Master, I'm broken and bent and twisted and scarred,
    But I've held my job, and Thou knowest, and Thou wilt not judge me
          hard.
    Thou knowest my sins are many, and often I've played the fool--
    Whiskey and cards and women, they made me the devil's tool.
    I was just like a child with money: I flung it away with a curse,
    Feasting a fawning parasite, or glutting a harlot's purse,
    Then back to the woods repentant, back to the mill or the mine,
    I, the worker of workers, everything in my line.
    Everything hard but headwork (I'd no more brains than a kid),
    A brute with brute strength to labour, doing as I was bid;
    Living in camps with men-folk, a lonely and loveless life;
    Never knew kiss of sweetheart, never caress of wife.
    A brute with brute strength to labour, and they were so far above--
    Yet I'd gladly have gone to the gallows for one little look of Love.
    I with the strength of two men, savage and shy and wild--
    Yet how I'd ha' treasured a woman, and the sweet, warm kiss of a child.
    Well, 'tis Thy world, and Thou knowest. I blaspheme and my ways be
          rude;
    But I've lived my life as I found it, and I've done my best to be good;
    I, the primitive toiler, half naked, and grimed to the eyes,
    Sweating it deep in their ditches, swining it stark in their styes,
    Hulling down forests before me, spanning tumultuous streams;
    Down in the ditch building o'er me palaces fairer than dreams;
    Boring the rock to the ore-bed, driving the road through the fen,
    Resolute, dumb, uncomplaining, a man in a world of men.
    Master, I've filled my contract, wrought in Thy many lands;
    Not by my sins wilt Thou judge me, but by the work of my hands.
    Master, I've done Thy bidding, and the light is low in the west,
    And the long, long shift is over ... Master, I've earned it--Rest.




GRIN


    If you're up against a bruiser and you're getting knocked about--
                                                            Grin.
    If you're feeling pretty groggy, and you're licked beyond a doubt--
                                                            Grin.
    Don't let him see you're funking, let him know with every clout,
    Though your face is battered to a pulp, your blooming heart is stout;
    Just stand upon your pins until the beggar knocks you out--
                                                            And grin.

    This life's a bally battle, and the same advice holds true,
                                                            Of grin.
    If you're up against it badly, then it's only one on you,
                                                            So grin.
    If the future's black as thunder, don't let people see you're blue;
    Just cultivate a cast-iron smile of joy the whole day through;
    If they call you "Little Sunshine," wish that _they'd_ no troubles,
          too--
                                                            You may--grin.

    Rise up in the morning with the will that, smooth or rough,
                                                            You'll grin.
    Sink to sleep at midnight, and although you're feeling tough,
                                                            Yet grin.
    There's nothing gained by whining, and you're not that kind of stuff;
    You're a fighter from away back, and you _won't_ take a rebuff;
    Your trouble is that you don't know when you have had enough--
                                                            Don't give in.
    If Fate should down you, just get up and take another cuff;
    You may bank on it that there is no philosophy like bluff
                                                            And grin.




THE SHOOTING OF DAN MCGREW


    A bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the Malamute saloon;
    The kid that handles the music-box was hitting a jag-time tune;
    Back of the bar, in a solo game, sat Dangerous Dan McGrew,
    And watching his luck was his light-o'-love, the lady that's known
          as Lou.

    When out of the night, which was fifty below, and into the din and
          the glare,
    There stumbled a miner fresh from the creeks, dog-dirty and loaded
          for bear.
    He looked like a man with a foot in the grave, and scarcely the
          strength of a louse,
    Yet he tilted a poke of dust on the bar, and he called for drinks
          for the house.
    There was none could place the stranger's face, though we searched
          ourselves for a clue;
    But we drank his health, and the last to drink was Dangerous Dan
          McGrew.

    There's men that somehow just grip your eyes, and hold them hard
          like a spell;
    And such was he, and he looked to me like a man who had lived in hell;
    With a face most hair, and the dreary stare of a dog whose day is done,
    As he watered the green stuff in his glass, and the drops fell one
          by one.
    Then I got to figgering who he was, and wondering what he'd do,
    And I turned my head--and there watching him was the lady that's
          known as Lou.

    His eyes went rubbering round the room, and he seemed in a kind of
          daze,
    Till at last that old piano fell in the way of his wandering gaze.
    The rag-time kid was having a drink; there was no one else on the
          stool,
    So the stranger stumbles across the room, and flops down there like
          a fool.
    In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him
          sway;
    Then he clutched the keys with his talon hands--my God! but that man
          could play!

    Were you ever out in the Great Alone, when the moon was awful clear,
    And the icy mountains hemmed you in with a silence you most could
          _hear_;
    With only the howl of a timber wolf, and you camped there in the cold,
    A half-dead thing in a stark, dead world, clean mad for the muck
          called gold;
    While high overhead, green, yellow, and red, the North Lights swept
          in bars--
    Then you've a haunch what the music meant ... hunger and night and
          the stars.

    And hunger not of the belly kind, that's banished with bacon and beans;
    But the gnawing hunger of lonely men for a home and all that it means;
    For a fireside far from the cares that are, four walls and a roof
          above;
    But oh! so cramful of cosy joy, and crowned with a woman's love;
    A woman dearer than all the world, and true as Heaven is true--
    (God! how ghastly she looks through her rouge,--the lady that's
          known as Lou.)

    Then on a sudden the music changed, so soft that you scarce could hear;
    But you felt that your life had been looted clean of all that it
          once held dear;
    That some one had stolen the woman you loved; that her love was a
          devil's lie;
    That your guts were gone, and the best for you was to crawl away and
          die.
    'Twas the crowning cry of a heart's despair, and it thrilled you
          through and through--
    "I guess I'll make it a spread misere," said Dangerous Dan McGrew.

    The music almost died away ... then it burst like a pent-up flood;
    And it seemed to say, "Repay, repay," and my eyes were blind with
          blood.
    The thought came back of an ancient wrong, and it stung like a
          frozen lash,
    And the lust awoke to kill, to kill ... then the music stopped with
          a crash,

    And the stranger turned, and his eyes they burned in a most peculiar
          way;
    In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him
          sway;
    Then his lips went in in a kind of grin, and he spoke, and his voice
          was calm;
    And, "Boys," says he, "you don't know me, and none of you care a damn;
    But I want to state, and my words are straight, and I'll bet my poke
          they're true,
    That one of you is a hound of hell ... and that one is Dan McGrew."

    Then I ducked my head, and the lights went out, and two guns blazed
          in the dark;
    And a woman screamed, and the lights went up, and two men lay stiff
          and stark;
    Pitched on his head, and pumped full of lead, was Dangerous Dan McGrew,
    While the man from the creeks lay clutched to the breast of the lady
          that's known as Lou.

    These are the simple facts of the case, and I guess I ought to know;
    They say that the stranger was crazed with "hooch," and I'm not
          denying it's so.
    I'm not so wise as the lawyer guys, but strictly between us two--
    The woman that kissed him and--pinched his poke--was the lady that's
          known as Lou.




THE CREMATION OF SAM MCGEE


    _There are strange things done in the midnight sun
      By the men who moil for gold;
    The Arctic trails have their secret tales
      That would make your blood run cold;
    The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,
      But the queerest they ever did see
    Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
      I cremated Sam McGee._

    Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.
    Why he left his home in the South to roam round the Pole God only
          knows.
    He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a
          spell;
    Though he'd often say in his homely way that he'd "sooner live in
          hell."

    On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail.
    Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven
          nail.
    If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze, till sometimes we
          couldn't see;
    It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.

    And that very night as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the
          snow,
    And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and
          toe,
    He turned to me, and, "Cap," says he, "I'll cash in this trip, I guess;
    And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request."

    Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no: then he says with a
          sort of moan:
    "It's the cursèd cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled
          clean through to the bone.
    Yet 'taint being dead, it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains:
    So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last
          remains."

    A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;
    And we started on at the streak of dawn, but God! he looked ghastly
          pale.
    He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in
          Tennessee;
    And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee.

    There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horror
          driven,
    With a corpse half-hid that I couldn't get rid because of a promise
          given;
    It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say: "You may tax your
          brawn and brains,
    But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last
          remains."

    Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern
          code.
    In the days to come, though my lips were dumb, in my heart how I
          cursed that load.
    In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies,
          round in a ring,
    Howled out their woes to the homeless snows--O God! how I loathed
          the thing!

    And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;
    And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;
    The trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give
          in;
    And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin.

    Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;
    It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice it was called the
          "Alice May."
    And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen
          chum:
    Then, "Here," said I, with a sudden cry, "is my cre-ma-tor-eum."

    Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;
    Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;
    The flames just soared, and the furnace roared--such a blaze you
          seldom see;
    And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee.

    Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;
    And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began
          to blow.
    It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I
          don't know why;
    And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky.

    I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;
    But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;
    I was sick with dread, but I bravely said: "I'll just take a peep
          inside.
    I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked," ... then the door I
          opened wide.

    And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the
          furnace roar;
    And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: "Please close
          that door.
    It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and
          storm--
    Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, it's the first time I've
          been warm."

    _There are strange things done in the midnight sun
      By the men who moil for gold;
    The Arctic trails have their secret tales
      That would make your blood run cold;
    The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,
      But the queerest they ever did see
    Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
      I cremated Sam McGee._




MY MADONNA


    I haled me a woman from the street,
      Shameless, but, oh, so fair!
    I bade her sit in the model's seat,
      And I painted her sitting there.

        I hid all trace of her heart unclean;
          I painted a babe at her breast;
        I painted her as she might have been
          If the Worst had been the Best.

    She laughed at my picture, and went away.
      Then came, with a knowing nod,
    A connoisseur, and I heard him say:
      "'Tis Mary, the Mother of God."

        So I painted a halo round her hair,
          And I sold her, and took my fee,
        And she hangs in the church of Saint Hilaire,
          Where you and all may see.




UNFORGOTTEN


    I know a garden where the lilies gleam,
      And one who lingers in the sunshine there;
      She is than white-stoled lily far more fair,
    And oh, her eyes are heaven-lit with dream.

        I know a garret, cold and dark and drear,
          And one who toils and toils with tireless pen,
          Until his brave, sad eyes grow weary--then
        He seeks the stars, pale, silent as a seer.

    And ah, it's strange, for desolate and dim
      Between these two there rolls an ocean wide;
      Yet he is in the garden by her side,
    And she is in the garret there with him.




THE RECKONING


    It's fine to have a blow-out in a fancy restaurant,
    With terrapin and canvas-back and all the wine you want;
    To enjoy the flowers and music, watch the pretty women pass,
    Smoke a choice cigar, and sip the wealthy water in your glass;
    It's bully in a high-toned joint to eat and drink your fill,
    But it's quite another matter when you
                                                  Pay the bill.

    It's great to go out every night on fun or pleasure bent,
    To wear your glad rags always, and to never save a cent;
    To drift along regardless, have a good time every trip;
    To hit the high spots sometimes, and to let your chances slip;
    To know you're acting foolish, yet to go on fooling still,
    Till Nature calls a show-down, and you
                                                  Pay the bill.

    Time has got a little bill--get wise while yet you may,
    For the debit side's increasing in a most alarming way;
    The things you had no right to do, the things you should have done,
    They're all put down: it's up to you to pay for every one.
    So eat, drink, and be merry, have a good time if you will,
    But God help you when the time comes, and you
                                                  Foot the bill.




QUATRAINS


    One said: Thy life is thine to make or mar,
    To flicker feebly, or to soar, a star;
    It lies with thee--the choice is thine, is thine,
    To hit the ties or drive thy auto-car.

    I answer Her: The choice is mine--ah, no!
    We all were made or marred long, long ago.
    The parts are written: hear the super wail:
    "Who is stage-managing this cosmic show?"

    Blind fools of fate, and slaves of circumstance,
    Life is a fiddler, and we all must dance.
    From gloom where mocks that will-o'-wisp, Freewill,
    I heard a voice cry: "Say, give us a chance."

    Chance! Oh, there is no chance. The scene is set.
    Up with the curtain! Man, the marionette,
    Resumes his part. The gods will work the wires.
    They've got it all down fine, you bet, you bet!

    It's all decreed: the mighty earthquake crash;
    The countless constellations' wheel and flash;
    The rise and fall of empires, war's red tide,
    The composition of your dinner hash.

    There's no haphazard in this world of ours:
    Cause and effect are grim, relentless powers.
    They rule the world. (A king was shot last night.
    Last night I held the joker and both bowers.)

    From out the mesh of fate our heads we thrust.
    We can't do what we would, but what we must.
    Heredity has got us in a cinch.
    (Consoling thought, when you've been on a "bust.")

    Hark to the song where spheral voices blend:
    "There's no beginning, never will be end."
    It makes us nutty; hang the astral chimes!
    The table's spread; come, let us dine, my friend.




THE MEN THAT DON'T FIT IN


    There's a race of men that don't fit in,
      A race that can't stay still;
    So they break the hearts of kith and kin,
      And they roam the world at will.
    They range the field and they rove the flood,
      And they climb the mountain's crest;
    Theirs is the curse of the gipsy blood,
      And they don't know how to rest.

        If they just went straight they might go far;
          They are strong and brave and true;
        But they're always tired of the things that are,
          And they want the strange and new.
        They say: "Could I find my proper groove,
          What a deep mark I would make!"
        So they chop and change, and each fresh move
          Is only a fresh mistake.

    And each forgets, as he strips and runs,
      With a brilliant, fitful pace,
    It's the steady, quiet, plodding ones
      Who win in the lifelong race.
    And each forgets that his youth has fled,
      Forgets that his prime is past,
    Till he stands one day with a hope that's dead
      In the glare of the truth at last.

        He has failed, he has failed; he has missed his chance;
          He has just done things by half.
        Life's been a jolly good joke on him,
          And now is the time to laugh.
        Ha, ha! He is one of the Legion Lost;
          He was never meant to win;
        He's a rolling stone, and it's bred in the bone;
          He's a man who won't fit in.




MUSIC IN THE BUSH


    O'er the dark pines she sees the silver moon,
      And in the west, all tremulous, a star;
    And soothing sweet she hears the mellow tune
      Of cow-bells jangled in the fields afar.

    Quite listless, for her daily stent is done,
      She stands, sad exile, at her rose-wreathed door,
    And sends her love eternal with the sun
      That goes to gild the land she'll see no more.

    The grave, gaunt pines imprison her sad gaze,
      All still the sky and darkling drearily;
    She feels the chilly breath of dear, dead days
      Come sifting through the alders eerily.

    Oh, how the roses riot in their bloom!
      The curtains stir as with an ancient pain;
    Her old piano gleams from out the gloom,
      And waits and waits her tender touch in vain.

    But now her hands like moonlight brush the keys
      With velvet grace, melodious delight;
    And now a sad refrain from overseas
      Goes sobbing on the bosom of the night.

    And now she sings. (O singer in the gloom,
      Voicing a sorrow we can ne'er express,
    Here in the Farness where we few have room
      Unshamed to show our love and tenderness,

    Our hearts will echo, till they beat no more,
      That song of sadness and of motherland;
    And stretched in deathless love to England's shore,
      Some day she'll hearken and she'll understand.)

    A prima-donna in the shining past,
      But now a mother growing old and grey,
    She thinks of how she held a people fast
      In thrall, and gleaned the triumphs of a day.

    She sees a sea of faces like a dream;
      She sees herself a queen of song once more;
    She sees lips part in rapture, eyes agleam;
      She sings as never once she sang before.

    She sings a wild, sweet song that throbs with pain,
      The added pain of life that transcends art,
    A song of home, a deep, celestial strain,
      The glorious swan-song of a dying heart.

    A lame tramp comes along the railway track,
      A grizzled dog whose day is nearly done:
    He passes, pauses, then comes slowly back
      And listens there--an audience of one.

    She sings--her golden voice is passion-fraught
      As when she charmed a thousand eager ears;
    He listens trembling, and she knows it not,
      And down his hollow cheeks roll bitter tears.

    She ceases and is still, as if to pray;
      There is no sound, the stars are all alight--
    Only a wretch who stumbles on his way,
      Only a vagrant sobbing in the night.




THE RHYME OF THE REMITTANCE MAN


    There's a four-pronged buck a-swinging in the shadow of my cabin,
      And it roamed the velvet valley till to-day;
    But I tracked it by the river, and I trailed it in the cover,
      And I killed it on the mountain miles away.
    Now I've had my lazy supper, and the level sun is gleaming
      On the water where the silver salmon play;
    And I light my little corn-cob, and I linger softly dreaming,
      In the twilight, of a land that's far away.

    Far away, so faint and far, is flaming London, fevered Paris,
      That I fancy I have gained another star;
    Far away the din and hurry, far away the sin and worry,
      Far away--God knows they cannot be too far.
    Gilded galley-slaves of Mammon--how my purse-proud brothers taunt me!
      I might have been as well-to-do as they
    Had I clutched like them my chances, learned their wisdom, crushed
          my fancies,
      Starved my soul and gone to business every day.

    Well, the cherry bends with blossom, and the vivid grass is springing,
      And the star-like lily nestles in the green;
    And the frogs their joys are singing, and my heart in tune is ringing,
      And it doesn't matter what I might have been,
    While above the scented pine-gloom, piling heights of golden glory,
      The sun-god paints his canvas in the west;
    I can couch me deep in clover, I can listen to the story
      Of the lazy, lapping water--it is best.
    While the trout leaps in the river, and the blue grouse thrills the
          cover,
      And the frozen snow betrays the panther's track,
    And the robin greets the dayspring with the rapture of a lover,
      I am happy, and I'll nevermore go back.
    For I know I'd just be longing for the little old log cabin,
      With the morning-glory clinging to the door,
    Till I loathed the city places, cursed the care on all the faces,
      Turned my back on lazar London evermore.

    So send me far from Lombard Street, and write me down a failure;
      Put a little in my purse and leave me free.
    Say: "He turned from Fortune's offering to follow up a pale lure,
      He is one of us no longer--let him be."
    I am one of you no longer: by the trails my feet have broken,
      The dizzy peaks I've scaled, the camp-fire's glow,
    By the lonely seas I've sailed in--yea, the final word is spoken,
      I am signed and sealed to nature. Be it so.




THE LOW-DOWN WHITE


    This is the pay-day up at the mines, when the bearded brutes come down;
    There's money to burn in the streets to-night, so I've sent my
          klooch to town,
    With a haggard face and a ribband of red entwined in her hair of brown.

    And I know at the dawn she'll come reeling home with the bottles,
          one, two, three;
    One for herself to drown her shame, and two big bottles for me,
    To make me forget the thing I am and the man I used to be.

    To make me forget the brand of the dog, as I crouch in this hideous
          place;
    To make me forget once I kindled the light of love in a lady's face,
    Where even the squalid Siwash now holds me a black disgrace.

    Oh, I have guarded my secret well! And who would dream as I speak
    In a tribal tongue like a rogue unhung, 'mid the ranch-house filth
          and reek,
    I could roll to bed with a Latin phrase, and rise with a verse of
          Greek?

    Yet I was a senior prizeman once, and the pride of a college eight;
    Called to the bar--my friends were true! but they could not keep me
          straight;
    Then came the divorce, and I went abroad and "died" on the River Plate.

    But I'm not dead yet; though with half a lung there isn't time to
          spare,
    And I hope that the year will see me out, and, thank God, no one
          will care--
    Save maybe the little slim Siwash girl with the rose of shame in her
          hair.

    She will come with the dawn, and the dawn is near; I can see its
          evil glow,
    Like a corpse-light seen through a frosty pane in a night of want
          and woe;
    And yonder she comes, by the bleak bull-pines, swift staggering
          through the snow.




THE LITTLE OLD LOG CABIN


    When a man gits on his uppers in a hard-pan sort of town,
      An' he ain't got nothin' comin', an' he can't afford ter eat,
    An' he's in a fix fer lodgin', an' he wanders up an' down,
      An' you'd fancy he'd been boozin', he's so locoed 'bout the feet;
    When he's feelin' sneakin' sorry, an' his belt is hangin' slack,
      An' his face is peaked an' grey-like, an' his heart gits down an'
          whines,
    Then he's apt ter git a-thinkin' an' a-wishin' he was back
      In the little ol' log cabin in the shadder of the pines.

    When he's on the blazin' desert, an' his canteen's sprung a leak,
      An' he's all alone an' crazy, an' he's crawlin' like a snail,
    An' his tongue's so black an' swollen that it hurts him fer to speak,
      An' he gouges down fer water, an' the raven's on his trail;
    When he's done with care and cursin', an' he feels more like to cry,
      An' he sees ol' Death a-grinnin', an' he thinks upon his crimes,
    Then he's like ter hev' a vision, as he settles down ter die,
      Of the little ol' log cabin an' the roses an' the vines.

    Oh, the little ol' log cabin, it's a solemn shinin' mark
      When a feller gits ter sinnin', an' a-goin' ter the wall,
    An' folks don't understand him, an' he's gropin' in the dark,
      An' he's sick of bein' cursed at, an' he's longin' fer his call:
    When the sun of life's a-sinkin' you can see it 'way above,
      On the hill from out the shadder in a glory 'gin the sky,
    An' your mother's voice is callin', an' her arms are stretched in love,
      An' somehow you're glad you're goin', an' you ain't a-scared to die;
    When you'll be like a kid again, an' nestle to her breast,
      An' never leave its shelter, an' forget, an' love, an' rest.




THE YOUNGER SON


    If you leave the gloom of London and you seek a glowing land,
      Where all except the flag is strange and new,
    There's a bronzed and stalwart fellow who will grip you by the hand,
      And greet you with a welcome warm and true;
    For he's your younger brother, the one you sent away,
      Because there wasn't room for him at home;
    And now he's quite contented, and he's glad he didn't stay,
      And he's building Britain's greatness o'er the foam.

    When the giant herd is moving at the rising of the sun,
      And the prairie is lit with rose and gold;
    And the camp is all a-bustle, and the busy day's begun,
      He leaps into the saddle sure and bold.
    Through the round of heat and hurry, through the racket and the rout,
      He rattles at a pace that nothing mars;
    And when the night-winds whisper, and camp-fires flicker out,
      He is sleeping like a child beneath the stars.

    When the wattle-blooms are drooping in the sombre she-oak glade,
      And the breathless land is lying in a swoon,
    He leaves his work a moment, leaning lightly on his spade,
      And he hears the bell-bird chime the Austral noon.
    The parakeets are silent in the gum-tree by the creek;
      The ferny grove is sunshine-steeped and still;
    But the dew will gem the myrtle in the twilight ere he seek
      His little lonely cabin on the hill.

    Around the purple, vine-clad slope the argent river dreams;
      The roses almost hide the house from view;
    A snow-peak of the Winterberg in crimson splendour gleams;
      The shadow deepens down on the karroo.
    He seeks the lily-scented dusk beneath the orange-tree:
      His pipe in silence glows and fades and glows,
    And then two little maids come out and climb upon his knee,
      And one is like the lily, one the rose.
    He sees his white sheep dapple o'er the green New Zealand plain,
      And where Vancouver's shaggy ramparts frown,
    When the sunlight threads the pine-gloom he is fighting might and main
      To clinch the rivets of an Empire down.
    You will find him toiling, toiling, in the south or in the west,
      A child of nature, fearless, frank and free;
    And the warmest heart that beats for you is beating in his breast,
      And he sends you loyal greeting o'er the sea.

    You've a brother in the Army, you've another in the Church;
      One of you is a diplomatic swell;
    You've had the pick of everything and left him in the lurch;
      And yet I think he's doing very well.
    I'm sure his life is happy, and he doesn't envy yours;
      I know he loves the land his pluck has won;
    And I fancy in the years unborn, while England's fame endures,
      She will come to bless with pride--the Younger Son.




THE MARCH OF THE DEAD


    The cruel war was over--oh, the triumph was so sweet!
      We watched the troops returning, through our tears;
    There was triumph, triumph, triumph down the scarlet glittering street,
      And you scarce could hear the music for the cheers.
    And you scarce could see the house-tops for the flags that flew
          between,
      The bells were pealing madly to the sky;
    And every one was shouting for the Soldiers of the Queen,
      And the glory of an age was passing by.

    And then there came a shadow, swift and sudden, dark and drear;
      The bells were silent, not an echo stirred.
    The flags were drooping sullenly, the men forgot to cheer;
      We waited, and we never spoke a word.
    The sky grew darker, darker, till from out the gloomy rack
      There came a voice that checked the heart with dread:
    "Tear down, tear down your bunting now, and hang up sable black;
      They are coming--it's the Army of the Dead."

    They were coming, they were coming, gaunt and ghastly, sad and slow;
      They were coming, all the crimson wrecks of pride;
    With faces seared, and cheeks red smeared, and haunting eyes of woe,
      And clotted holes the khaki couldn't hide.
    Oh, the clammy brow of anguish! the livid, foam-flecked lips!
      The reeling ranks of ruin swept along!
    The limb that trailed, the hand that failed, the bloody finger-tips!
      And oh, the dreary rhythm of their song!

    "They left us on the veldt-side, but we felt we couldn't stop,
      On this, our England's crowning festal day;
    We're the men of Magersfontein, we're the men of Spion Kop,
      Colenso,--we're the men who had to pay.
    We're the men who paid the blood-price. Shall the grave be all our
          gain?
      You owe us. Long and heavy is the score.
    Then cheer us for our glory now, and cheer us for our pain,
      And cheer us as ye never cheered before."

    The folks were white and stricken, and each tongue seemed weighed
          with lead;
      Each heart was clutched in hollow hand of ice;
    And every eye was staring at the horror of the dead,
      The pity of the men who paid the price.
    They were come, were come to mock us, in the first flush of our peace;
      Through writhing lips their teeth were all agleam;
    They were coming in their thousands--oh, would they never cease!
      I closed my eyes, and then--it was a dream.

    There was triumph, triumph, triumph down the scarlet gleaming street;
      The town was mad, a man was like a boy.
    A thousand flags were flaming where the sky and city meet;
      A thousand bells were thundering the joy.
    There was music, mirth and sunshine; but some eyes shone with regret:
      And while we stun with cheers our homing braves,
    O God, in Thy great mercy, let us nevermore forget
      The graves they left behind, the bitter graves.




"FIGHTING MAC"

A LIFE TRAGEDY


    A pistol-shot rings round and round the world:
      In pitiful defeat a warrior lies.
    A last defiance to dark Death is hurled,
      A last wild challenge shocks the sunlit skies.
      Alone he falls with wide, wan, woeful eyes:
    Eyes that could smile at death--could not face shame.

    Alone, alone he paced his narrow room,
      In the bright sunshine of that Paris day;
    Saw in his thought the awful hand of doom;
      Saw in his dream his glory pass away;
      Tried in his heart, his weary heart, to pray:
    "O God! who made me, give me strength to face
    The spectre of this bitter, black disgrace."

           *       *       *       *       *

    The burn brawls darkly down the shaggy glen,
      The bee-kissed heather blooms around the door;
    He sees himself a barefoot boy again,
      Bending o'er page of legendary lore.
      He hears the pibroch, grips the red claymore,
    Runs with the Fiery Cross a clansman true,
    Sworn kinsman of Rob Roy and Roderick Dhu.

    Eating his heart out with a wild desire,
      One day, behind his counter trim and neat,
    He hears a sound that sets his brain afire--
      The Highlanders are marching down the street.
      Oh, how the pipes shrill out, the mad drums beat!
    "On to the gates of Hell, my Gordons gay!"
    He flings his hated yardstick far away.

    He sees the sullen pass, high-crowned with snow,
      Where Afghans cower with eyes of gleaming hate.
    He hurls himself against the hidden foe.
      They try to rally--ah, too late, too late!
      Again, defenceless, with fierce eyes that wait
    For death, he stands, like baited bull at bay,
    And flouts the Boers, that mad Majuba day.

    He sees again the murderous Soudan,
      Blood-slaked and rapine swept. He seems to stand
    Upon the gory plain of Omdurman.
      Then Magersfontein, and supreme command
      Over his Highlanders. To shake his hand
    A King is proud, and princes call him friend,
    And glory crowns his life--and now the end.

    The awful end. His eyes are dark with doom;
      He hears the shrapnel shrieking overhead:
    He sees the ravaged ranks, the flame-stabbed gloom.
      Oh, to have fallen! the battle-field his bed,
      With Wauchope and his glorious brother-dead.
    Why was he saved for this, for this? And now
    He raises the revolver to his brow.

           *       *       *       *       *

    In many a Highland home, framed with rude art,
      You'll find his portrait, rough-hewn, stern and square:
    It's graven in the Fuyam fellah's heart;
      The Ghurka reads it at his evening prayer;
      The raw lands know it, where the fierce suns glare;
    The Dervish fears it. Honour to his name,
    Who holds aloft the shield of England's fame.

    Mourn for our hero, men of Northern race!
      We do not know his sin; we only know
    His sword was keen. He laughed death in the face,
      And struck, for Empire's sake, a giant blow.
      His arm was strong. Ah! well they learnt, the foe.
    The echo of his deeds is ringing yet,
    Will ring for aye. All else ... let us forget.




THE WOMAN AND THE ANGEL


    An angel was tired of heaven, as he lounged in the golden street;
    His halo was tilted sideways, and his harp lay mute at his feet;
    So the Master stooped in His pity, and gave him a pass to go,
    For the space of a moon, to the earth-world, to mix with the men below.

    He doffed his celestial garments, scarce waiting to lay them straight;
    He bade goodbye to Peter, who stood by the golden gate;
    The sexless singers of heaven chanted a fond farewell,
    And the imps looked up as they pattered on the red-hot flags of hell.

    Never was seen such an angel: eyes of a heavenly blue,
    Features that shamed Apollo, hair of a golden hue;
    The women simply adored him, his lips were like Cupid's bow;
    But he never ventured to use them--and so they voted him slow.

    Till at last there came One Woman, a marvel of loveliness,
    And she whispered to him: "Do you love me?" And he answered that
          woman, "Yes."
    And she said: "Put your arms around me, and kiss me, and hold me--so--"
    But fiercely he drew back, saying: "This thing is wrong, and I know."

    Then sweetly she mocked his scruples, and softly she him beguiled:
    "You, who are verily man among men, speak with the tongue of a child.
    We have outlived the old standards; we have burst, like an
          over-tight thong,
    The ancient, outworn, puritanic traditions of Right and Wrong."

    Then the Master feared for His angel, and called him again to His side,
    For oh, the woman was wondrous, and oh, the angel was tried.
    And deep in his hell sang the Devil, and this was the strain of his
          song:
    "The ancient, outworn, puritanic traditions of Right and Wrong."




THE RHYME OF THE RESTLESS ONES


    We couldn't sit and study for the law;
      The stagnation of a bank we couldn't stand;
    For our riot blood was surging, and we didn't need much urging
    To excitements and excesses that are banned.
    So we took to wine and drink and other things,
      And the devil in us struggled to be free;
    Till our friends rose up in wrath, and they pointed out the path,
    And they paid our debts and packed us o'er the sea.

    Oh, they shook us off and shipped us o'er the foam,
    To the larger lands that lure a man to roam;
            And we took the chance they gave
            Of a far and foreign grave,
    And we bade goodbye for evermore to home.

    And some of us are climbing on the peak,
      And some of us are camping on the plain;
    By pine and palm you'll find us, with never claim to bind us,
    By track and trail you'll meet us once again.

    We are fated serfs to freedom--sky and sea;
      We have failed where slummy cities overflow;
    But the stranger ways of earth know our pride and know our worth,
    And we go into the dark as fighters go.

    Yes, we go into the night as brave men go,
    Though our faces they be often streaked with woe;
            Yet we're hard as cats to kill,
            And our hearts are reckless still,
    And we've danced with death a dozen times or so.

    And you'll find us in Alaska after gold,
      And you'll find us herding cattle in the South.
    We like strong drink and fun; and when the race is run,
      We often die with curses in our mouth.

    We are wild as colts unbroke, but never mean;
      Of our sins we've shoulders broad to bear the blame;
    But we'll never stay in town, and we'll never settle down,
      And we'll never have an object or an aim.

    No, there's that in us that time can never tame;
    And life will always seem a careless game;
            And they'd better far forget--
            Those who say they love us yet--
    Forget, blot out with bitterness our name.




NEW YEAR'S EVE


    It's cruel cold on the water-front, silent and dark and drear;
      Only the black tide weltering, only the hissing snow;
    And I, alone, like a storm-tossed wreck, on this night of the glad
          New Year,
      Shuffling along in the icy wind, ghastly and gaunt and slow.

    They're playing a tune in McGuffy's saloon, and it's cheery and
          bright in there
      (God! but I'm weak--since the bitter dawn, and never a bite of food);
    I'll just go over and slip inside--I mustn't give way to despair--
      Perhaps I can bum a little booze if the boys are feeling good.

    They'll jeer at me, and they'll sneer at me, and they'll call me a
          whiskey soak;
      ("Have a drink? Well, thankee kindly, sir, I don't mind if I do.")
    A drivelling, dirty gin-joint fiend, the butt of the bar-room joke;
      Sunk and sodden and hopeless--"Another? Well, here's to you!"

    McGuffy is showing a bunch of the boys how Bob Fitzsimmons hit;
      The barman is talking of Tammany Hall, and why the ward boss got
          fired;
    I'll just sneak into a corner, and they'll let me alone a bit;
      The room is reeling round and round ... O God, but I'm tired, I'm
          tired....

           *       *       *       *       *

    Roses she wore on her breast that night. Oh, but their scent was sweet;
      Alone we sat on the balcony, and the fan-palms arched above;
    The witching strain of a waltz by Strauss came up to our cool retreat,
      And I prisoned her little hand in mine, and I whispered my plea of
          love.

    Then sudden the laughter died on her lips, and lowly she bent her head;
      And oh, there came in the deep, dark eyes a look that was heaven
          to see
    And the moments went, and I waited there, and never a word was said,
      And she plucked from her bosom a rose of red, and shyly gave it to
          me.

    Then the music swelled to a crash of joy, and the lights blazed up
          like day;
      And I held her fast to my throbbing heart, and I kissed her bonny
          brow;
    "She is mine, she is mine for evermore!" the violins seemed to say,
      And the bells were ringing the New Year in--O God! I can hear them
          now.

    Don't you remember that long, last waltz, with its sobbing, sad
          refrain?
      Don't you remember that last goodbye, and the dear eyes dim with
          tears?
    Don't you remember that golden dream, with never a hint of pain,
      Of lives that would blend like an angel-song in the bliss of the
          coming year?

    Oh, what have I lost! What have I lost! Ethel, forgive, forgive!
      The red, red rose is faded now, and it's fifty years ago.
    'Twere better to die a thousand deaths than live each day as I live!
      I have sinned, I have sunk to the lowest depths--but oh, I have
          suffered so!

    Hark! Oh hark! I can hear the bells!... Look! I can see her there,
      Fair as a dream ... but it fades ... And now--I can hear the
          dreadful hum
    Of the crowded court ... See! the Judge looks down ... NOT GUILTY,
          my Lord, I swear ...
      The bells, I can hear the bells again ... Ethel, I come, I come!...

           *       *       *       *       *

    "Rouse up, old man, it's twelve o'clock. You can't sleep here, you
          know.
      Say! ain't you got no sentiment? Lift up your muddled head;
    Have a drink to the glad New Year, a drop before you go--
      You darned old dirty hobo ... My God! Here, boys! He's DEAD!"




COMFORT


    Say! You've struck a heap of trouble--
      Bust in business, lost your wife;
    No one cares a cent about you,
      You don't care a cent for life;
    Hard luck has of hope bereft you,
      Health is failing, wish you'd die--
    Why, you've still the sunshine left you,
      And the big, blue sky.

            Sky so blue it makes you wonder
              If it's heaven shining through;
            Earth so smiling 'way out yonder,
              Sun so bright it dazzles you;
            Birds a-singing, flowers a-flinging
              All their fragrance on the breeze;
            Dancing shadows, green, still meadows--
              Don't you mope, you've still got these.

    These, and none can take them from you;
      These, and none can weigh their worth.
    What! you're tired and broke and beaten?--
      Why, you're rich--you've got the earth!
    Yes, if you're a tramp in tatters,
      While the blue sky bends above,
    You've got nearly all that matters,
      You've got God, and God is love.




PREMONITION


    'Twas a year ago and the moon was bright
      (Oh, I remember so well, so well),
    I walked with my love in a sea of light,
      And the voice of my sweet was a silver bell.

        And sudden the moon grew strangely dull,
          And sudden my love had taken wing;
        I looked on the face of a grinning skull,
          I strained to my heart a ghastly thing.

    'Twas but fantasy, for my love lay still
      In my arms with her tender eyes aglow,
    And she wondered why my lips were chill,
      Why I was silent and kissed her so.

        A year has gone and the moon is bright,
          A gibbous moon like a ghost of woe;
        I sit by a new-made grave to-night,
          And my heart is broken--it's strange, you know.




THE TRAMPS


    Can you recall, dear comrade, when we tramped God's land together,
      And we sang the old, old Earth-song, for our youth was very sweet;
    When we drank and fought and lusted, as we mocked at tie and tether,
      Along the road to Anywhere, the wide world at our feet.

    Along the road to Anywhere, when each day had its story;
      When time was yet our vassal, and life's jest was still unstale;
    When peace unfathomed filled our hearts as, bathed in amber glory,
      Along the road to Anywhere we watched the sunsets pale.

    Alas! the road to Anywhere is pitfalled with disaster;
      There's hunger, want, and weariness, yet O we loved it so!
    As on we tramped exultantly, and no man was our master,
      And no man guessed what dreams were ours, as swinging heel and toe,
    We tramped the road to Anywhere, the magic road to Anywhere,
      The tragic road to Anywhere, such dear, dim years ago.




_L'ENVOI_


    _You who have lived in the Land,
      You who have trusted the trail;
    You who are strong to withstand,
      You who are swift to assail;
    Songs have I sung to beguile,
      Vintage of desperate years
    Hard as a harlot's smile,
      Bitter as unshed tears._

                      _Little of joy or mirth,
                        Little of ease I sing;
                      Sagas of men of earth,
                        Humanly suffering,
                      Such as you all have done;
                        Savagely faring forth,
                      Sons of the midnight sun,
                        Argonauts of the North._

    _Far in the land God forgot
      Glimmers the lure of your trail;
    Still in your lust are you taught
      Even to win is to fail.
    Still must you follow and fight
      Under the vampire wing;
    There in the long, long night
      Hoping and vanquishing._

                      _Husbandmen of the Wild,
                        Reaping a barren gain;
                      Scourged by desire, reconciled
                        Unto disaster and pain;
                      These my songs are for you,
                        You who are seared with the brand:
                      God knows I have tried to be true;
                        Please God you will understand._

PREFACE


THIS volume deals with a series of journeys taken with a dog team over
the winter trails in the interior of Alaska. The title might have
claimed fourteen or fifteen thousand miles instead of ten, for the book
was projected and the title adopted some years ago, and the journeys
have continued. But ten thousand is a good round titular number, and is
none the worse for being well within the mark.

So far as mere distance is concerned, anyway, there is nothing
noteworthy in this record. There are many men in Alaska who have done
much more. A mail-carrier on one of the longer dog routes will cover
four thousand miles in a winter, while the writer's average is less than
two thousand. But his sled has gone far off the beaten track, across the
arctic wilderness, into many remote corners; wherever, indeed, white men
or natives were to be found in all the great interior.

These journeys were connected primarily with the administration of the
extensive work of the Episcopal Church in the interior of Alaska, under
the bishop of the diocese; but that feature of them has been fully set
forth from time to time in the church publications, and finds only
incidental reference here.

It is a great, wild country, little known save along accustomed routes
of travel; a country with a beauty and a fascination all its own; mere
arctic wilderness, indeed, and nine tenths of it probably destined
always to remain such, yet full of interest and charm.

Common opinion "outside" about Alaska seems to be veering from the view
that it is a land of perpetual snow and ice to the other extreme of
holding it to be a "world's treasure-house" of mineral wealth and
agricultural possibility. The world's treasure is deposited in many
houses, and Alaska has its share; its mineral wealth is very great, and
"hidden doors of opulence" may open at any time, but its agricultural
possibilities, in the ordinary sense in which the phrase is used, are
confined to very small areas in proportion to the enormous whole, and in
very limited degree.

It is no new thing for those who would build railways to write in
high-flown style about the regions they would penetrate, and, indeed, to
speak of "millions of acres waiting for the plough" is not necessarily a
misrepresentation; they are waiting. Nor is it altogether unnatural that
professional agricultural experimenters at the stations established by
the government should make the most of their experiments. When Dean
Stanley spoke disdainfully of dogma, Lord Beaconsfield replied; "Ah! but
you must always remember, no dogmas, no deans."

Besides the physical attractions of this country, it has a gentle
aboriginal population that arouses in many ways the respect and the
sympathy of all kindly people; and it has some of the hardiest and most
adventurous white men in the world. The reader will come into contact
with both in these pages.

So much for the book's scope; a word of its limitations. It is confined
to the interior of Alaska; confined in the main to the great valley of
the Yukon and its tributaries; being a record of sled journeys, it is
confined to the winter.

There is no man living who knows the whole of Alaska or who has any
right to speak about the whole of Alaska. Bishop Rowe knows more about
Alaska, in all probability, than any other living man, and there are
large areas of the country in which he has never set foot. There is
probably no man living, save Bishop Rowe, who has visited even the
localities of all the missions of the Episcopal Church in Alaska. If one
were to travel continuously for a whole year, using the most expeditious
means at his command, and not wasting a day anywhere, it is doubtful
whether, summer and winter, by sea and land, squeezing the last mile out
of the seasons, travelling on the "last ice" and the "first water," he
could even touch at all the mission stations. So, when a man from Nome
speaks of Alaska he means his part of Alaska, the Seward Peninsula. When
a man from Valdez or Cordova speaks of Alaska he means the Prince
William Sound country. When a man from Juneau speaks of Alaska he means
the southeastern coast. Alaska is not one country but many, with
different climates, different resources, different problems, different
populations, different interests; and what is true of one part of it is
often grotesquely untrue of other parts. This is the reason why so many
contradictory things have been written about the country. Not only do
these various parts of Alaska differ radically from one another, but
they are separated from one another by almost insuperable natural
obstacles, so that they are in reality different countries.

When Alaska is spoken of in this book the interior is meant, in which
the writer has travelled almost continuously for the past eight years.
The Seward Peninsula is the only other part of the country that the book
touches. And as regards summer travel and the summer aspect of the
country, there is material for another book should the reception of this
one warrant its preparation.

       *       *       *       *       *

The problems of the civil government of the country will be found
touched upon somewhat freely as they rise from time to time in the
course of these journeys, and some faint hope is entertained that
drawing attention to evils may hasten a remedy.

Alaska is not now, and never has been, a lawless country in the old,
Wild Western sense of unpunished homicides and crimes of violence. It
has been, on the whole, singularly free from bloodshed--a record due in
no small part to the fact that it is not the custom of the country to
carry pistols, for which again there is climatic and geographic reason;
due also in part to the very peaceable and even timid character of its
native people.

But as regards the stringent laws enacted by Congress for the protection
of these native people, and especially in the essential particular of
protecting them from the fatal effects of intoxicating liquor, the
country is not law-abiding, for these laws are virtually a dead letter.

Justices of the peace who must live wholly upon fees in regions where
fees will not furnish a living, and United States deputy marshals
appointed for political reasons, constitute a very feeble staff against
law-breakers. When it is remembered that on the whole fifteen hundred
miles of the American Yukon there are but six of these deputy marshals,
and that these six men, with another five or six on the tributary
rivers, form all the police of the country, it will be seen that
Congress must do something more than pass stringent laws if those laws
are to be of any effect.

A body of stipendiary magistrates, a police force wholly removed from
politics and modelled somewhat upon the Canadian Northwest Mounted
Police--these are two of the great needs of the country if the liquor
laws are to be enforced and the native people are to survive.

That the danger of the extermination of the natives is a real one all
vital statistics kept at Yukon River points in the last five years show,
and that there are powerful influences in the country opposed to the
execution of the liquor laws some recent trials at Fairbanks would leave
no room for doubt if there had been any room before. Indeed, at this
writing, when the pages of this book are closed and there remains no
place save the preface where the matter can be referred to, an impudent
attempt is on foot, with large commercial backing, to secure the
removal of a zealous and fearless United States district attorney, who
has been too active in prosecuting liquor-peddlers to suit the wholesale
dealers in liquor.

There are, of course, those who view with perfect equanimity the
destruction of the natives that is now going on, and look forward with
complacency to the time when the Alaskan Indian shall have ceased to
exist. But to men of thought and feeling such cynicism is abhorrent, and
the duty of the government towards its simple and kindly wards is clear.

A measure of real protection must be given the native communities
against the low-down whites who seek to intrude into them and build
habitations for convenient resort upon occasions of drunkenness and
debauchery, and some adequate machinery set up for suppressing the
contemptible traffic in adulterated spirits they subsist largely upon.
The licensed liquor-dealers do not themselves sell to Indians, but they
notoriously sell to men who notoriously peddle to Indians, and the
suppression of this illicit commerce would materially reduce the total
sales of liquor.

Some measure of protection, one thinks, must also be afforded against a
predatory class of Indian traders, the back rooms of whose stores are
often barrooms, gambling-dens, and houses of assignation, and
headquarters and harbourage for the white degenerates--even if the
government go the length of setting up co-operative Indian stores in the
interior, as has been done in some places on the coast. This last is a
matter in which the missions are helpless, for there is no wise
combination of religion and trade.

So this book goes forth with a plea in the front of it, which will find
incidental support and expression throughout it, for the natives of
interior Alaska, that they be not wantonly destroyed off the face of the
earth.

PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION


IT is gratifying to know that a second edition of this book has been
called for and it is interesting to write another preface; it even
proved interesting to do what was set about most reluctantly--the
reading of the book over again after entire avoidance of it for two
years. It was necessary to do it, though one shrank from it, and it is
interesting to know that after this comparatively long and complete
detachment I find little to add and less to correct. Upon a complete
rereading I am content to let the book stand, with two or three
footnotes thrown in, and the correction of the one printer's error it
contained from cover to cover--an error that a score of kind
correspondents pointed out, for it was conspicuous in the title of a
picture.

The tendency to which attention is drawn in the original preface, the
pendulum swing from the old notion that Alaska is a land of polar bears
and icebergs to the new notion that it is a "world's treasure-house of
mineral wealth and unbounded agricultural possibilities" is yet more
marked than it was two years ago. The beginning of the building of the
government railway has given new impetus to the "boosting" writers for
magazines and newspapers. Quite recently it was stated in one such
publication that we need not worry about the destruction of our
forests, for had we not the inexhaustible timber resources of the
interior of Alaska to draw upon?

And in the North itself--though no one there would write about the
timber resources of the interior--in certain shrill journals the man who
does not confidently expect to see the Yukon Flats waving with golden
grain and "the lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea" of the Koyukuk and
the Chandalar is regarded as a traitor to his country and his God. But
it must be remembered that there are a number of journalists in Alaska
who know nothing of the country outside their respective towns, and that
"boosting" grows shriller, as Eugene Field found red paint grow redder,
"the further out West one goes." When they get a newspaper at Cape
Prince of Wales what a clarion it will be!

Truth, however, is not more wont than of old to be found in extremes,
and the author of this book believes that those who desire a sober view
of the country it deals with will find it herein. He claims no more than
that he has had adequate opportunity of forming his opinions and that he
has a right to their expression. It is now twelve years since he began
almost constant travelling, winter and summer, in the interior of
Alaska. He has described nothing that he has not seen; ventured no
judgment that he has not well digested, and has nothing to retract or
even modify; but he would repeat and emphasise a caution of the original
preface. Alaska is not one country but many countries, and so widely do
they differ from one another in almost every respect that no general
statements about Alaska can be true. The present author's knowledge of
the territory is confined in the main to the interior--to the valley of
the Yukon and its tributary rivers, which make up one of the world's
great waterways--and nothing of his writing applies, with his authority,
to other parts.

The matter of the preservation of the native peoples still presses, and
is nearer to the author's heart than any other matter whatever. The
United States Congress, which voted thirty-five millions of dollars for
the government railroad, strikes out year by year the modest additional
score or two of thousands that year by year the Bureau of Education asks
for the establishment of hospital work amongst the Indians of the
interior, and the preventable mortality continues to be very great.

In the last two years, largely as the result of the untiring efforts of
Bishop Rowe on behalf of the natives, two modern, well-equipped
hospitals have been built, with money that he and his clergy have
gathered, on the Yukon River, one at Fort Yukon and one at Tanana; and
these are the only places of any kind, on nearly a thousand miles of the
river, where sick or injured Indians may be received and cared for.

Amongst men of thought and feeling there is noticeable revulsion from
the supercilious attitude that used not to be uncommon toward the little
peoples of the world. It begins to be recognised that it is quite
possible that even the smallest of the little peoples may have some
contribution to make to the welfare and progress of the human race. What
is the Boy Scout movement that is sweeping the country, to the enormous
benefit of the rising generation, but the incorporating into the nurture
of our youth of the things that were the nurture of the Indian youth;
that are a large part of the nurture of the Alaskan Indian youth to-day?
And the camp-fire clubs and woodcraft associations and the whole trend
to the life of the open recognise that the Indian had developed a
technique of wilderness life deserving of preservation for its value to
the white man. While as for the Esquimaux, the author never sees the
extraordinary prevalence amongst them of the art of graphic delineation
displayed in bold etchings of incidents of the chase upon their
implements and weapons (though not upon the articles made by the dozen
for the curio-venders at Nome and Saint Michael) without dreaming that
some day an artist will come from out that singular and most interesting
people who shall teach the world something new about art.

Whatever the future may hold for the interior of Alaska, the author is
convinced that its population will derive very largely from the present
native stocks, and this alone would justify any efforts to prevent
further inroads upon their health and vitality.

TEN THOUSAND MILES WITH A DOG SLED




AUTHOR'S NOTE


Three fundamental facts are to be borne constantly in mind by those who
would form any intelligent conception of the Territory of Alaska.

(1) Its area of approximately 590,000 square miles makes it two and a
half times as large as the State of Texas.

(2) But it is not, like Texas, one homogeneous body of land; it is not,
in any geographical sense, one country at all. "Sweeping in a great arc
over sixteen degrees of latitude and fifty-eight degrees of longitude,"
it is no less than four, and some might say five, different countries,
differing from one another in almost every way that one country can
differ from another: in climate, in population, in resources, in
requirements; and--

(3) These different countries are not merely different from one another,
they are _separated_ from one another by formidable natural barriers.




TEN THOUSAND MILES WITH A DOG SLED




CHAPTER I

FAIRBANKS TO THE CHANDALAR THROUGH CIRCLE CITY AND FORT YUKON


THE plan for the winter journey of 1905-6 (my second winter on the
trail) was an ambitious one, for it contemplated a visit to Point Hope,
on the shore of the Arctic Ocean between Kotzebue Sound and Point
Barrow, and a return to Fairbanks. In the summer such a journey would be
practicable only by water: down the Tanana to the Yukon, down the Yukon
to its mouth, and then through the straits of Bering and along the
Arctic coast; in the winter it is possible to make the journey across
country. A desire to visit our most northerly and most inaccessible
mission in Alaska and a desire to become acquainted with general
conditions in the wide country north of the Yukon were equal factors in
the planning of a journey which would carry me through three and a half
degrees of latitude and no less than eighteen degrees of longitude.

The course of winter travel in Alaska follows the frozen waterways so
far as they lead in the general direction desired, leaves them to cross
mountain ranges and divides at the most favourable points, and drops
down into the streams again so soon as streams are available. The
country is notably well watered and the waterways are the natural
highways. The more frequented routes gradually cut out the serpentine
bends of the rivers by land trails, but in the wilder parts of the
country travel sticks to the ice.

Our course, therefore, lay up the Chatanika River and one of its
tributaries until the Tanana-Yukon watershed was reached; then through
the mountains, crossing two steep summits to the Yukon slope, and down
that slope by convenient streams to the Yukon River at Circle City.

[Sidenote: THE GOLD TRAIN]

We set out on the 27th of November with six dogs and a "basket" sled and
about five hundred pounds' weight of load, including tent and stove,
bedding, clothes for the winter, grub box and its equipment, and dog
feed. The dogs were those that I had used the previous winter, with one
exception. The leader had come home lame from the fish camp where he had
been boarded during the summer, and, despite all attentions, the
lameness had persisted; so he must be left behind, and there was much
difficulty in securing another leader. A recent stampede to a new mining
district had advanced the price of dogs and gathered up all the good
ones, so it was necessary to hunt all over Fairbanks and pay a hundred
dollars for a dog that proved very indifferent, after all. "Jimmy" was a
handsome beast, the handsomest I ever owned and the costliest, but, as I
learned later from one who knew his history, had "travelled on his
looks all his life." He earned the name of "Jimmy the Fake."

Midway to Cleary "City," on the chief gold-producing creek of the
district, our first day's run, we encountered the gold train. For some
time previous a lone highwayman had robbed solitary miners on their way
to Fairbanks with gold-dust, and now a posse was organised that went the
rounds of the creeks and gathered up the dust and bore it on mule-back
to the bank, escorted by half a dozen armed and mounted men. Sawed-off
shotguns were the favourite weapons, and one judged them deadly enough
at short range. The heavy "pokes" galled the animals' backs, however
they might be slung, and the little procession wound slowly along, a man
ahead, a man behind, and four clustered round the treasure.

These raw, temporary mining towns are much alike the world over, one
supposes, though perhaps a little worse up here in the far north. It was
late at night when we reached the place, but saloon and dance-hall were
ablaze with light and loud with the raucity of phonographs and the
stamping of feet. Everything was "wide open," and there was not even the
thinnest veneer of respectability. Drinking and gambling and dancing go
on all night long. Drunken men reel out upon the snow; painted faces
leer over muslin curtains as one passes by. Without any government,
without any pretence of municipal organisation, there is no co-operation
for public enterprise. There are no streets, there are no sidewalks
save such as a man may choose to lay in front of his own premises, and
the simplest sanitary precautions are entirely neglected. Nothing but
the cold climate of the north prevents epidemic disease from sweeping
through these places. They rise in a few days wherever gold is found in
quantities, they flourish as the production increases, decline with its
decline, and are left gaunt, dark, and abandoned so soon as the diggings
are exhausted.

The next day we were on the Chatanika River, to which Cleary Creek is
tributary, and were immediately confronted with one of the main troubles
and difficulties of winter travel in this and, as may be supposed, in
any arctic or subarctic country--overflow water.

[Sidenote: OVERFLOW WATER AND ICE]

In the lesser rivers, where deep pools alternate with swift shallows,
the stream freezes solid to the bottom upon the shoals and riffles.
Since the subterranean fountains that supply the river do not cease to
discharge their waters in the winter, however cold it may be, there
comes presently an increasing pressure under the ice above such a
barrier. The pent-up water is strong enough to heave the ice into mounds
and at last to break forth, spreading itself far along the frozen
surface of the river. At times it may be seen gushing out like an
artesian well, rising three or four feet above the surface of the ice,
until the pressure is relieved. Sometimes for many miles at a stretch
the whole river will be covered with a succession of such overflows,
from two or three inches deep to eight or ten, or even twelve; some just
bursting forth, some partially frozen, some resolved into solid "glare"
ice. Thus the surface of the river is continually renewed the whole
winter through, and a section of the ice crust in the spring would show
a series of laminations; here ice upon ice, there ice upon
half-incorporated snow, that mark the successive inundations.

This explanation has been given at length because of the large part that
the phenomenon plays in the difficulty and danger of winter travel, and
because it seems hard to make those who are not familiar with it
understand it. At first sight it would seem that after a week or ten
days of fifty-below-zero weather, for instance, all water everywhere
would be frozen into quiescence for the rest of the winter. Throw a
bucket of water into the air, and it is frozen solid as soon as it
reaches the ground. There would be no more trouble, one would think,
with water. Yet some of the worst trouble the traveller has with
overflow water is during very cold weather, and it is then, of course,
that there is the greatest danger of frost-bite in getting one's feet
wet. Water-proof footwear, therefore, becomes one of the "musher's"
great concerns and difficulties. The best water-proof footwear is the
Esquimau mukluk, not easily obtainable in the interior of Alaska, but
the mukluk is an inconvenient footwear to put snow-shoes on. Rubber
boots or shoes of any kind are most uncomfortable things to travel in.
Nothing equals the moccasin on the trail, nothing is so good to
snow-shoe in. The well-equipped traveller has moccasins for dry trails
and mukluks for wet trails--and even then may sometimes get his feet
wet. Nor are his own feet his only consideration; his dogs' feet are,
collectively, as important as his own. When the dog comes out of water
into snow again the snow collects and freezes between the toes, and if
not removed will soon cause a sore and lameness. Then a dog moccasin
must be put on and the foot continually nursed and doctored. When
several dogs of a team are thus affected, it may be with several feet
each, the labour and trouble of travel are greatly increased.

So, whenever his dogs have been through water, the careful musher will
stop and go all down the line, cleaning out the ice and snow from their
feet with his fingers. Four interdigital spaces per foot make sixteen
per dog, and with a team of six dogs that means ninety-six several
operations with the bare hand (if it be done effectually) every time the
team gets into an overflow. The dogs will do it for themselves if they
are given time, tearing out the lumps of ice with their teeth; but,
inasmuch as they usually feel conscientiously obliged to eat each lump
as they pull it out, it takes much longer, and in a short daylight there
is little time to spare if the day's march is to be made.

[Sidenote: "OVERFLOW" ICE]

We found overflow almost as soon as we reached the Chatanika River, and
in one form or another we encountered it during all the two days and a
half that we were pursuing the river's windings. At times it was covered
with a sheet of new ice that would support the dogs but would not
support the sled, so that the dogs were travelling on one level and the
sled on another, and a man had to walk along in the water between the
dogs and the sled for several hundred yards at a time, breaking down the
overflow ice with his feet.

At other times the thin sheets of overflow ice would sway and bend as
the sled passed quickly over them in a way that gives to ice in such
condition its Alaskan name of "rubber-ice," while for the fifteen or
twenty miles of McManus Creek, the headwaters of the Chatanika, we had
continuous stretches of fine glare ice with enough frost crystals upon
it from condensing moisture to give a "tooth" to the dogs' feet, just as
varnish on a photographic negative gives tooth to the retouching pencil.
Perfectly smooth ice is a very difficult surface for dogs to pass over;
glare ice slightly roughened by frost deposit makes splendid, fast
going.

Eighty-five miles or so from Fairbanks, and just about half-way to
Circle, the watercourse is left and the first summit is the
"Twelve-Mile," as it is called. We tried hard to take our load up at one
trip, but found it impossible to do so, and had to unlash the sled and
take half the load at a time, caching it on the top while we returned
for the other half.

It took us half a day to get our load to the top of the Twelve-Mile
summit, a rise of about one thousand three hundred feet from the creek
bed as the aneroid gave it. In the steeper pitches we had to take the
axe and cut steps, so hard and smooth does the incessant wind at these
heights beat the snow, and on our second trip to the top we were just in
time to rescue a roll of bedding that had been blown from the cache and
was about to descend a gully from which we could hardly have recovered
it.

This summit descended, we were in Birch Creek water, and had we followed
the watercourse would have reached the Yukon; but we would have
travelled hundreds of miles and would have come out below Fort Yukon,
while we were bound for Circle City. So there was another and a yet more
difficult summit to cross before we could descend the Yukon slope. We
were able to hire a man and two dogs to help us over the Eagle summit,
so that the necessity of relaying was avoided. One man ahead continually
calling to the dogs, eight dogs steadily pulling, and two men behind
steadily pushing, foot by foot, with many stoppages as one bench after
another was surmounted, we got the load to the top at last, a rise of
one thousand four hundred feet in less than three miles. A driving
snow-storm cut off all view and would have left us at a loss which way
to proceed but for the stakes that indicated it.

The descent was as anxious and hazardous as the ascent had been
laborious. The dogs were loosed and sent racing down the slope. With a
rope rough-lock around the sled runners, one man took the gee pole and
another the handle-bars and each spread-eagled himself through the loose
deep snow to check the momentum of the sled, until sled and men turned
aside and came to a stop in a drift to avoid a steep, smooth pitch. The
sled extricated, it was poised on the edge of the pitch and turned loose
on the hardened snow, hurtling down three or four hundred feet until it
buried itself in another drift. The dogs were necessary to drag it from
this drift, and one had to go down and bring them up. Then again they
were loosed, and from bench to bench the process was repeated until the
slope grew gentle enough to permit the regulation of the downward
progress by the foot-brake.

[Sidenote: "SUMMITS"]

The Eagle summit is one of the most difficult summits in Alaska. The
wind blows so fiercely that sometimes for days together its passage is
almost impossible. No amount of trail making could be of much help, for
the snow smothers up everything on the lee of the hill, and the end of
every storm presents a new surface and an altered route. A "summit" in
this Alaskan sense is, of course, a saddle between peaks, and in this
case there is no easier pass and no way around. The only way to avoid
the Eagle summit, without going out of the district altogether, would be
to tunnel it.

The summit passed, we found better trails and a more frequented country,
for in this district are a number of creeks that draw supplies from
Circle City, and that had been worked ten years or more.

At the time of the Klondike stampede of 1896-97, Circle City was already
established as a flourishing mining camp and boasted itself the largest
log-cabin town in the world. Before the Klondike drew away its people as
a stronger magnet draws iron filings from a lesser one, Circle had a
population of about three thousand. Take a town of three thousand and
reduce it to thirty or forty, and it is hard to resist the melancholy
impression which entrance upon it in the dusk of the evening brings.
There lay the great white Yukon in the middle distance; beyond it the
Yukon Flats, snow-covered, desolate, stretched away enormously, hedged
here at their beginning by grey, dim hills. Spread out in the foreground
were the little, squat, huddling cabins that belonged to no one, with
never a light in a window or smoke from a chimney, the untrodden snow
drifted against door and porch. It would be hard to imagine a drearier
prospect, and one had the feeling that it was a city of the dead rather
than merely a dead city.

The weather had grown steadily colder since we reached the Yukon slope,
and for two days before reaching Circle the thermometer had stood
between 40° and 50° below zero. It was all right for us to push on, the
trail was good and nearly all down-hill, and there were road-houses
every ten or twelve miles. Freighters, weather-bound, came to the doors
as we passed by with our jangle of bells and would raise a somewhat
chechaco pride in our breasts by remarking: "You don't seem to care what
weather you travel in!" The evil of it was that the perfectly safe
travelling between Eagle Creek and Circle emboldened us to push on from
Circle under totally different conditions, when travelling at such low
temperatures became highly dangerous and brought us into grave
misadventure that might easily have been fatal catastrophe.

Our original start was a week later than had been planned and we had
made no time, but rather lost it, on this first division of the journey.
If we were to reach Bettles on the Koyukuk River for Christmas, there
was no more time to lose, and I was anxious to spend the next Sunday at
Fort Yukon, three days' journey away. So we started for Fort Yukon on
Thursday, the 7th of December, the day after we reached Circle.

[Sidenote: THE YUKON FLATS]

A certain arctic traveller has said that "adventures" always imply
either incompetence or ignorance of local conditions, and there is some
truth in the saying. Our misadventure was the result of a series of
mistakes, no one of which would have been other than discreditable to
men of more experience. Our course lay for seventy-five miles through
the Yukon Flats, which begin at Circle and extend for two hundred and
fifty miles of the river's course below that point. The Flats constitute
the most difficult and dangerous part of the whole length of the Yukon
River, summer or winter, and the section between Circle City and Fort
Yukon is the most difficult and dangerous part of the Flats. Save for a
"portage" or land trail of eighteen or twenty miles out of Circle, the
trail is on the river itself, which is split up into many channels
without salient landmarks. The current is so swift that many stretches
run open water far into the winter, and blow-holes are numerous. There
is little travel on the Flats in winter, and a snow-storm accompanied by
wind may obliterate what trail there is in an hour. The vehicle used in
the Flats is not a sled but a toboggan, and our first mistake was in not
conforming to local usage in this respect. There is always a very good
reason for local usage about snow vehicles. But a toboggan which had
been ordered from a native at Fort Yukon would be waiting for us, and
it seemed not worth while to go to the expense of buying another merely
for three days' journey.

The second mistake was in engaging a boy as guide instead of a man. He
was an attractive youth of about fourteen who had done good service at
the Circle City mission the previous winter, when our nurse-in-charge
was contending single-handed against an epidemic of diphtheria. He was a
pleasant boy, with some English, who wanted to go and professed
knowledge of the route. The greatest mistake of all was starting out
through that lonely waste with the thermometer at 52° below zero. The
old-timers in Alaska have a saying that "travelling at 50° below is all
right as long as it's all right." If there be a good trail, if there be
convenient stopping-places, if nothing go wrong, one may travel without
special risk and with no extraordinary discomfort at 50° below zero and
a good deal lower. I have since that time made a short day's run at 62°
below, and once travelled for two or three hours on a stretch at 65°
below. But there is always more or less chance in travelling at low
temperatures, because a very small thing may necessitate a stop, and a
stop may turn into a serious thing. At such temperatures one must keep
going. No amount of clothing that it is possible to wear on the trail
will keep one warm while standing still. For dogs and men alike,
constant brisk motion is necessary; for dogs as well as men--even though
dogs will sleep outdoors in such cold without harm--for they cannot take
as good care of themselves in the harness as they can when loose. A
trace that needs mending, a broken buckle, a snow-shoe string that must
be replaced, may chill one so that it is impossible to recover one's
warmth again. The bare hand cannot be exposed for many seconds without
beginning to freeze; it is dangerous to breathe the air into the lungs
for any length of time without a muffler over the mouth.

Our troubles began as soon as we started. The trail was a narrow,
winding toboggan track of sixteen or seventeen inches, while our sled
was twenty inches wide, so that one runner was always dragging in the
loose snow, and that meant slow, heavy going.

[Sidenote: SUNRISE AND SUNSET]

The days were nearing the shortest of the year, when, in these
latitudes, the sun does but show himself and withdraw again. But,
especially in very cold weather, which is nearly always very clear
weather, that brief appearance is preceded by a feast of rich, delicate
colour. First a greenish glow on the southern horizon, brightening into
lemon and then into clear primrose, invades the deep purple of the
starry heavens. Then a beautiful circle of blush pink above a circle of
pure amethyst gradually stretches all around the edge of the sky, slowly
brightening while the stars fade out and the heavens change to blue. The
dead white mirror of the snow takes every tint that the skies display
with a faint but exquisite radiance. Then the sun's disk appears with a
flood of yellow light but with no appreciable warmth, and for a little
space his level rays shoot out and gild the tree tops and the distant
hills. The snow springs to life. Dead white no longer, its dry,
crystalline particles glitter in myriads of diamond facets with every
colour of the prism. Then the sun is gone, and the lovely circle of rose
pink over amethyst again stretches round the horizon, slowly fading
until once more the pale primrose glows in the south against the purple
sky with its silver stars. Thus sunrise and sunset form a continuous
spectacle, with a purity of delicate yet splendid colour that only
perfectly dry atmosphere permits. The primrose glow, the heralding
circle, the ball of orange light, the valedictory circle, the primrose
glow again, and a day has come and gone. Air can hold no moisture at all
at these low temperatures, and the skies are cloudless.

[Sidenote: AN ESCAPADE ON THE YUKON]

Moreover, in the wilds at 50° below zero there is the most complete
silence. All animal life is hidden away. Not a rabbit flits across the
trail; in the absolutely still air not a twig moves. A rare raven passes
overhead, and his cry, changed from a hoarse croak to a sweet liquid
note, reverberates like the musical glasses. There is no more delightful
sound in the wilderness than this occasional lapse into music of the
raven. We wound through the scrub spruce and willow and over the
niggerhead swamps, a faint tinkle of bells, a little cloud of steam; for
in the great cold the moisture of the animals' breath hangs over their
heads in the still air, and on looking back it stands awhile along the
course at dogs' height until it is presently deposited on twigs and
tussocks. We wound along, a faint tinkle of bells, a little cloud of
steam, and in the midst of the cloud a tousle of shaggy black-and-white
hair and red-and-white pompons--going out of the dead silence behind
into the dead silence before. The dusk came, and still we plodded and
pushed our weary way, swinging that heavy sled incessantly, by the gee
pole in front and the handle-bars behind, in the vain effort to keep it
on the trail. Two miles an hour was all that we were making. We had come
but thirteen or fourteen miles out of twenty-four, and it was dark; and
it grew colder.

The dogs whined and stopped every few yards, worn out by wallowing in
the snow and the labour of the collar. The long scarfs that wrapped our
mouths and noses had been shifted and shifted, as one part after another
became solid with ice from the breath, until over their whole length
they were stiff as boards. After two more miles of it it was evident
that we could not reach the mail cabin that night. Then I made my last
and worst mistake. We should have stopped and camped then and there. We
had tent and stove and everything requisite. But the native boy insisted
that the cabin was "only little way," and any one who knows the misery
of making camp in extremely cold weather, in the dark, will understand
our reluctance to do so.

I decided to make a cache of the greater part of our load--tent and
stove and supplies generally--and to push on to the cabin with but the
bedding and the grub box, returning for the stuff in the morning. And,
since in the deepest depths of blundering there is a deeper still, by
some one's carelessness, but certainly by my fault, the axe was left
behind in the cache.

With our reduced burden we made better progress, and in a short time
reached the end of the portage and came out on the frozen river, just as
the moon, a day or two past the full, rose above the opposite bank. One
sees many strange distortions of sun and moon in this land, but never
was a stranger seen than this. Her disk, shining through the dense air
of the river bottom, was in shape an almost perfect octagon, regular as
though it had been laid off with dividers and a ruler.

We were soon in doubt about the trail. The mail-carrier had gone down
only two or three times this winter and each time had taken a different
route, as more and more of the river closed and gave him more and more
direct passage. A number of Indians had been hunting, and their tracks
added to the tangle of trails. Presently we entered a thick mist that
even to inexperienced eyes spoke of open water or new ice yet moist. So
heavy was the vapour that to the man at the handle-bars the man at the
gee pole loomed ghostly, and the man ahead of the dogs could not be
distinguished at all. We had gone so much farther than our native boy
had declared we had to go that we began to fear that in the confusion of
trails we had taken the wrong one and had passed the cabin. That is the
tenderfoot's, or, as we say, the chechaco's, fear; it is the one thing
that it may almost be said never happens. But the boy fell down
completely and was frankly at a loss. All we could get out of him was:
"May-be-so we catch cabin bymeby, may-be-so no." If we had passed the
cabin it was twenty odd miles to the next; and it grew colder and the
dogs were utterly weary again, prone upon the trail at every small
excuse for a stop, only to be stirred by the whip, heavily wielded.
Surely never men thrust themselves foolhardily into worse predicament!
Then I made my last mistake. Dimly the bank loomed through the mist, and
I said: "We can't go any farther; I think we've missed the trail and I'm
going across to yon bank to see if there's a place to camp." I had not
gone six steps from the trail when the ice gave way under my feet and I
found myself in water to my hips.

[Sidenote: AN ESCAPADE ON THE YUKON]

Under Providence I owe it to the mukluks I wore, tied tight round my
knees, that I did not lose my life, or at least my feet. The thermometer
at Circle City stood at 60° below zero at dark that day, and down on the
ice it is always about 5° colder than on the bank, because cold air is
heavy air and sinks to the lowest level, and 65° below zero means 97°
below freezing.

My moose-hide breeches froze solid the moment I scrambled out, but not a
drop of water got to my feet. If the water had reached my feet they
would have frozen almost as quickly as the moose hide in that fearful
cold. Thoroughly alarmed now, and realising our perilous situation, we
did the only thing there was to do--we turned the dogs loose and
abandoned the sled and went back along the trail we had followed as fast
as we could. We knew that we could safely retrace our steps and that the
trail would lead us to the bank after a while. We knew not where the
trail would lead us in the other direction. As a matter of fact, it led
to the mail cabin, two miles farther on, and the mail-carrier was at
that time occupying it at the end of his day's run.

The dogs stayed with the sled; dogs will usually stay with their sled;
they seem to recognise their first allegiance to the load they haul,
probably because they know their food forms part of it.

Our cache reached, we made a fire, thawed out the iron-like armour of my
leather breeches, and cutting a spare woollen scarf in two, wrapped the
dry, warm pieces about my numbed thighs. Then we pushed on the eighteen
miles or so to Circle, keeping a steady pace despite the drowsiness that
oppressed us, and that oppressed me particularly owing to the chill of
my ducking. About five in the morning we reached the town, and the
clergyman, the Reverend C. E. Rice, turned out of his warm bed and I
turned in, none the worse in body for the experience, but much humbled
in spirit. My companion, Mr. E. J. Knapp, whose thoughtful care for me I
always look back upon with gratitude, as well as upon Mr. Rice's
kindness, froze his nose and a toe slightly, being somewhat neglectful
of himself in his solicitude for me.

We had been out about twenty hours in a temperature ranging from 52° to
60° below zero, had walked about forty-four miles, labouring incessantly
as well as walking, what time we were with the sled, with nothing to
eat--it was too cold to stop for eating--and, in addition to this, one
of us had been in water to the waist, yet none of us took any harm. It
was a providential overruling of blundering foolhardiness for which we
were deeply thankful.

The next day a native with a fast team and an empty toboggan was sent
down to take our load on to the cabin and bring the dogs back.
Meanwhile, the mail-carrier had passed the spot, had seen the abandoned
sled standing by recently broken ice, and had come on into town while we
slept and none knew of our return, with the news that some one had been
drowned. The mail for Fairbanks did but await the mail from Fort Yukon,
and the town rumour, instantly identifying the abandoned sled, was
carried across to Fairbanks, to my great distress and annoyance. The
echoes of the distorted account of this misadventure which appeared in a
Fairbanks newspaper still reverberate in "patent insides" of the
provincial press of the United States.

[Sidenote: FORT YUKON ]

The next Monday we started again, this time with a toboggan and with a
man instead of a boy for guide, and in three days of only moderate
difficulty we reached Fort Yukon.

Fort Yukon, though it holds no attraction for the ordinary visitor or
the summer tourist on the river, is a place of much interest to those
who know the history of Alaska. While it is purely a native village,
with no white population save the traders and the usual sprinkling of
men that hang around native villages, it is yet the oldest white man's
post on the Yukon River, save the post established by the Russians at
Nulato, five or six hundred miles lower down. The Hudson Bay Company
established itself here in 1846, and that date serves as the year one
in making calculations and determining ages to this day. It is a fixed
point in time that every native knows of. Any old man can tell you
whether he was born before or after that date, and, if before, can pick
out some boy that is about the age he was when the event occurred. The
massacre at Nulato in 1851 serves in a similar way for the lower river.

After the Purchase, and the determination of the longitude of Fort Yukon
by Mr. Raymond in 1869--who made the first steamboat journey up the
Yukon on that errand--the Hudson Bay Company moved three times before
they succeeded in getting east of the 141st meridian, and at the point
reached on the third move, the New Rampart House on the Porcupine River,
only a few hundred yards beyond the boundary-line, they remained until
the gold excitement on the Yukon and the journeying of the natives to
new posts on that river rendered trading unprofitable; then they
withdrew to the Mackenzie. The oldest white men's graves in Alaska,
again with the exception of Nulato, are those in the little Hudson Bay
cemetery near Fort Yukon.

[Sidenote: ARCHDEACON MACDONALD ]

Fort Yukon is also the site of the oldest missionary station on the
river, unless there were earlier visits of Russian priests to the lower
river, of which there seems no record, for in 1862 there was a clergyman
of the Church of England at this place. Archdeacon MacDonald was a
remarkable man. Married to a native wife, he translated the whole Bible
and the Book of Common Prayer into the native tongue, and his
translations are in general use on the upper river to this day. He
reduced the language to writing, extracted its grammar, taught the
Indians to read and write their own tongue, and dignified it by the gift
of the great literature of the sacred books. The language is, of course,
a dying one--English is slowly superseding it--but it seems safe to say
that for a generation or two yet to come it will be the basis of the
common speech of the people and the language of worship. It is chiefly
in matters of trading and handicrafts that English is taking its place,
though here as elsewhere it stands to the discredit of the civilised
race that blackguard English is the first English that is learned.

There seems ground to question whether the substitution of a smattering
of broken English for the flexibility and picturesque expressiveness of
an indigenous tongue, thoroughly understood, carries with it any great
intellectual gain, though to suggest such a doubt is treason to some
minds. The time threatens when all the world will speak two or three
great languages, when all little tongues will be extinct and all little
peoples swallowed up, when all costume will be reduced to a dead level
of blue jeans and shoddy and all strange customs abolished. The world
will be a much less interesting world then; the spice and savour of the
ends of the earth will be gone. Nor does it always appear unquestionable
that the world will be the better or the happier. The advance of
civilisation would be a great thing to work for if we were quite sure
what we meant by it and what its goal is. To the ordinary government
school-teacher in Alaska, with some notable exceptions, it seems to
mean chiefly teaching the Indians to call themselves Mr. and Mrs. and
teaching the women to wear millinery, with a contemptuous attitude
toward the native language and all native customs. The less intelligent
grade of missionary sometimes falls into the same easy rut. So letters
pass through the post-offices addressed: "Mr. Pretty Henry," "Mrs.
Monkey Bill," "Miss Sally Shortandirty"; so, occasionally, the grotesque
spectacle may present itself, to the passengers on a steamer, of a
native woman in a "Merry Widow" hat and a blood-stained parkee gutting
salmon on the river bank.

The nobler ideal, as it seems to some of us, is to labour for
God-fearing, self-respecting Indians rather than imitation white men and
white women. An Indian who is honest, healthy and kindly, skilled in
hunting and trapping, versed in his native Bible and liturgy, even
though he be entirely ignorant of English and have acquired no taste for
canned fruit and know not when Columbus discovered America, may be very
much of a man in that station of life in which it has pleased God to
call him.

Christmas and the Fourth of July are the Indian's great holidays, the
one just after the best moose hunting and the other just before the
salmon run. It may be supposed that there were always great feasts at
the winter and summer solstices, though now he is sufficiently devout at
the one and patriotic at the other. At these seasons, and for weeks
before and after, Fort Yukon gathers a large number of Indians. It is
the native metropolis of the country within a radius of a hundred
miles, and what may be termed its permanent population of one hundred
and fifty is doubled and sometimes trebled by contingents from the
Chandalar, the Porcupine, and the Black Rivers, from that long river
called Birch Creek, and all the intervening country. Many families of
the "uncivilised," self-respecting kind, to which reference has been
made, come in from outlying points, and the contrast between them and
their more sophisticated kinfolk of the town is all in their favour.

[Sidenote: JIMMY]

Such a gathering had already taken place in preparation for the
Christmas holidays when we reached Fort Yukon on the 15th of December.
It would have been pleasant to spend Christmas with them, but we were
due two hundred and fifty miles away, at Bettles, for that feast, if by
any means we could get there. So we lingered but the two days necessary
to equip ourselves. Jimmy had torn our bedding to pieces on the night of
the mishap; it was lashed on the outside of the load, and he had
scratched and clawed it to make a nest for himself until fur from the
robe and feathers from the quilts were all over the trail. The other
dogs, not so warmly coated as he, had been content to sleep in the snow.
Jimmy's character was gradually revealing itself. A well-bred trail dog
will not commit the canine sacrilege of invading the sled. That is a
"Siwash" dog's trick. So there was fresh bedding to manufacture, as well
as supplies for two hundred miles to get together.

A mail once a month went at that time from Fort Yukon to the Koyukuk,
and there was little other travel. The course lay fifty or sixty miles
across country to the Chandalar River, about one hundred miles up that
stream, and then across a divide to the South Fork of the Koyukuk, and
across another to the Middle Fork, on which Coldfoot is situated. It is
not possible to procure any supplies, save sometimes a little fish for
dog food and that not certainly, between Fort Yukon and Coldfoot, so
that provision for the whole journey must be taken.

[Sidenote: THE CHANDALAR]

A new Indian guide had been engaged as far as Coldfoot, and we set
out--three men, two toboggans, and seven dogs; four on the larger
vehicle and three on the smaller, one of the dogs brought by our guide.
Three miles from Fort Yukon we crossed the Porcupine River and then
plunged into the wilderness of lake and swamp and forest that stretches
north of the Yukon. A portage trail, as such a track across country is
called to distinguish it from a river trail, has the advantage of such
protection from storm as its timbered stretches afford. For miles and
miles the route passes through scrub spruce that has been burned over,
with no prospect but a maze of charred poles against the snow, some
upright, others at every angle of inclination. Then comes a lake, with
difficulty in finding the trail on its wind-swept surface and sometimes
much casting about to discover where it leaves the lake again, and then
more small burned timber. Wherever the route is through woods, living or
dead, it is blazed; when it strikes the open, one is often at a loss.
After three or four days of such travel, sometimes reaching an old cabin
for the night, sometimes pitching the tent, one is rejoiced at the
sight of distant mountains and at the intimation they bring that the
inexpressible dreariness of the Yukon Flats is nearly past; and
presently the trail opens suddenly upon the broad Chandalar.

The Hudson Bay voyageurs are responsible for many names in this part of
Alaska, and Chandalar is a corruption of their "Gens de large." The
various native tribes received appellations indicating habitats. A tribe
that differed from most northern Indians, in having no permanent
villages and in living altogether in encampments, was named "Gens de
large," and the river which they frequented took their name.

It is one of the second-rate tributaries of the Yukon, and in general
its waters are swift and shallow, not navigable for light-draught
steamboats for more than one hundred and fifty miles, save at flood, and
not easily navigable at all. It is these swift shallow streams that are
so formidable in winter on account of overflow water, and the Chandalar
is one of the most dreaded.

[Sidenote: DIPHTHERIA]

Ten miles along the river's surface brought us to the Chandalar native
village, a settlement of half a dozen cabins and twenty-five or thirty
souls. The people came out to meet us, and said they were just about to
bury a baby, and asked me to conduct the funeral. Because we had not
done a day's march and were under compulsion to push on at our best
speed, I did not unlash the sled but went just as I was up the hill with
the sorrowful procession to the little graveyard. On the way down I
asked as best I could of what sickness the baby had died, and I felt
some uneasiness when the throat was pointed to as the seat of disease.
When, presently, I was informed that two others were sick, and of the
same complaint, my uneasiness became alarm. I went at once to see them,
and the angry swollen throats patched with white membrane which I
discovered left no room for doubt that we were in the presence of
another outbreak of diphtheria. That disease had scourged the Yukon in
the two preceding years. Twenty-three children died at Fort Yukon in the
summer of 1904, half a dozen at Circle in the following winter, though
that outbreak was grappled with from the first; and all along the river
the loss of life was terrible.

There was no question that we must give up all hope of reaching Bettles
for Christmas and stay and do what we could for these people. So we made
camp on the outskirts of the village, and I went to work swabbing out
the throats with carbolic acid and preparing liquid food from our grub
box. There was nothing to eat in the village but dried fish and a little
dried moose, and these throats like red-hot iron could hardly swallow
liquids. The two patients were a boy of sixteen and a grown woman. It
was evident that unless we could isolate them the disease would probably
pass through the whole village, and, indeed, others might have been
infected already. It was likely that we were in for a siege of it, and
our supply of condensed milk and extract of beef would soon be
exhausted. Moreover, at Fort Yukon was the trained nurse who had coped
with the epidemic there and at Circle, while we had virtually no
experience with the disease at all. It was resolved to send back to Fort
Yukon for supplies and for the nurse.

The next morning Mr. Knapp and the native boy took the dogs and the sled
and started back. With no load save a little grub and bedding, they
could make the journey in two days, a day must be allowed for
preparations, and, with the aid of another dog team, two days more would
bring them back. Five days was the least they could be gone. It was
asking a great deal of this lady to abandon her Christmas festival,
preparations for which had long been making, and to come sixty-five
miles through the frozen wilderness in a toboggan; but I felt sure she
would drop everything and come.

For those five days I was busied in close attention to the patients and
in strenuous though not altogether availing efforts to maintain a
quarantine of the cabin in which they lay. There was little more that I
could do than swab out the throats and administer food every two hours.
As the disease advanced it was increasingly painful to swallow and
exceedingly difficult to induce the sufferers to make the attempt or to
open their mouths for the swabbing. After two or three days the woman
seemed to have passed the crisis of the disease and to be mending, but
the boy, I thought, grew worse. One becomes attached to those to whom
one ministers, and this poor, speechless boy, with his terrible throat
and the agony in his big black eyes, appealed to me very strongly
indeed. It was torture to move his head or to open his mouth, and I had
to torture him continually.

Every night I gathered the people for Divine service. Here was a little
community far off in the wilds that had carefully conserved and handed
on to their children the teaching they had received no less than thirty
years before. The native Bibles and prayer-books and hymnals were
brought out, bearing dates of publication in the seventies; one of their
number acted as leader, and what he read was painfully followed in the
well-thumbed books. They lifted their voices in a weird transformation
of familiar tunes, with quavers and glides that had crept in through
long, uncorrected use, and amongst the prayers said was one for "Our
Sovereign lady Queen Victoria, and Albert Edward, Prince of Wales." I
tried to explain that Queen Victoria was dead, that they were not living
under British rule, and I took a pencil and struck out the prayers for
the royal family from the books. But there was doubt in their minds and
a reluctance to alter in any particular the liturgy that had been taught
them, and it is quite likely that intercessions for a defunct sovereign
of another land still arise from the Chandalar village. One cannot but
feel a deep admiration for the pioneer missionaries of this
region--Bishop Bompas, Archdeacon MacDonald, and the others--whose
teaching was so thorough and so lasting, and who lived and laboured here
long before any gold seeker had thought of Alaska, when the country was
an Indian country exclusively, with none of the comforts and
conveniences that can now be enjoyed. It was to a remote cabin on the
East Fork of this river that Archdeacon MacDonald retired for a year to
make part of his translation of the Bible, according to the Indian
account.

[Sidenote: THE SHORTEST DAY]

At noon on the 21st of December, the shortest day, there is a note in my
diary that I saw the sun's disk shining through the trees. Although
fully half a degree of latitude north of the Arctic Circle, the
refraction is sufficient to lift his whole sphere above the horizon. One
speculates how much farther north it would be possible to see any part
of the sun at noon on the shortest day; but north of here, throughout
Alaska, is broken and mountainous country. We were on the northern edge
of the great flat of the interior.

The fifth day at the village was Christmas Eve. My boy was in a critical
condition, very low and weak, with a temperature that stayed around 101°
and 102°. As night approached I watched with the greatest anxiety for
the party from Fort Yukon, and, just as the last lingering glow of the
long twilight was fading from the south, there was a distant tinkle of
bells on the trail, and faintly once and again a man's voice was raised
in command and I knew that relief was at hand.

The nurse had dropped everything and had come, as I felt sure she would.
Gathering medicines and supplies and hiring a native dog team and
driver, she had left immediately, and the round trip had been made in
the shortest time it was possible to make it. It was a tremendous relief
to see her step out of the rugs and robes of the toboggan and take
charge of the situation in her quiet, competent way. A small, outlying
cabin was selected for a hospital, the family that occupied it bundled
out into a tent, and the two sick persons carefully moved into it, with
whom and the mother of the sick boy the nurse took up her abode. Then
there was the Christmas-tree in the chief's cabin, with little gifts for
the children sent out from the mission at Fort Yukon some time before,
and a dance afterward, for Christmas festivities must go on, whatever
happens, at a native village. I took James's pocket-knife to him after
the celebration was over, and I think he really tried to smile as he
thanked me with his eyes.

The next day after the services, although it was Christmas Day, we set
to work on the disinfecting of the large cabin in which the sick had
lain. Stringing bedclothes and wearing apparel on lines from wall to
wall, and stuffing up every crack and cranny with cotton, we burned
quantities of sulphur, that the nurse had brought with her, all day
long.

A recent article in a stray number of a professional journal picked up
in the office of a medical missionary, devoted column after column to
the uselessness of all known methods of disinfection. Sulphur,
formaldehyde, carbolic acid, permanganate of potash, chloride of lime,
bichloride of mercury--the author knew not which of these "fetiches" to
be most sarcastic about. It may be that the net result of our copious
fumigation was but the bleaching of the coloured garments hung up, but
at least it did no harm. One sometimes wishes that these scientists who
sit up so high in the seat of the scornful would condescend to a little
plain instruction.

The anti-diphtheritic serum is now kept in readiness at all our
missions in Alaska, and the disease seems to have ceased its
depredations; but it has taken terrible toll of the native people.

[Sidenote: THE MISSIONARY NURSE]

We wished to stay with the nurse until the sickness should be done, but
she would not hear of it, and insisted upon the resumption of our
journey. It did not seem right to go off and leave this lonely woman,
sixty-five miles from the nearest white person, to cope with an outbreak
of disease that might not yet have spent itself, although there had been
no new case for a week. "You've done your work here, now leave me to do
mine. You'll not get to Point Hope this winter if you stay much longer."

"Aren't you afraid to stay all by yourself?" I asked, somewhat
fatuously.

"Afraid? Afraid of what? You surely don't mean afraid of the natives?"

I did not know what I meant; it seemed not unnatural that a woman with
such prospect before her should be a little timid, but she was resolute
that we go, and we went.

Not until the next summer did I learn the upshot--both patients
recovered and there was no other case. Six years later, when these words
are written, I have just baptized a son of the boy who lay so ill, who
would have perished, I think, had we not reached the Chandalar village
just in time.




CHAPTER II

CHANDALAR VILLAGE TO BETTLES, COLDFOOT, AND THE KOYUKUK


AT five o'clock in the morning of the 27th of December, hours before any
kind of daylight, while the faint "pit-pat" of all-night dancing still
sounded from the chief's cabin, we dropped down the steep bank to the
river surface and resumed our journey. Ahead was a man with a candle in
a tin can, peering for the faint indications of the trail on the ice;
the other two were at the handle-bars of the toboggans. It is strange
that in this day of invention and improvement in artificial
illumination, a candle in a tin can is still the most dependable light
for the trail. A coal-oil lamp requires a glass which is easily broken,
and the ordinary coal-oil that comes to Alaska freezes at about 40°
below. In very cold weather a coal-oil lantern full of oil will go out
completely from the freezing of its supply. All the various acetylene
lamps are useless because water is required to generate the gas, and
water may not be had without stopping and building a fire and melting
ice or snow. The electric flash-lamp, useful enough round camp, goes out
of operation altogether on the trail, because the "dry" cell that
supplies its current is not a dry cell at all, but a moist cell, and
when its moisture freezes is dead until it thaws out again. No extremity
of cold will stop a candle from burning, and if it be properly sheltered
by the tin can it will stand a great deal of wind. The "folding pocket
lantern," which is nothing but a convenient tin can with mica sides, is
the best equipment for travel, but an empty butter can or lard can is
sometimes easier to come by.

The Chandalar is wide-spread in these parts, with several channels, and
the trail was hard to follow. One track we pursued led us up a bank and
along a portage and presently stopped at a marten trap; and we had to
cut across to the river and cast about hither and thither on its broad
surface to find the mail trail.

[Sidenote: THE CHANDALAR GAP]

All the rivers that are confluent with the Yukon in the Flats enter that
dreary region through gaps in the mountains that bound the broad plain.
These gaps are noted for wind, and the Chandalar Gap, which had loomed
before us since daybreak, is deservedly in especial bad repute. The most
hateful thing in the Arctic regions is the wind. Cold one may protect
one's self against, but there is no adequate protection against wind.
The parkee without opening front or back, that pulls on over the head,
is primarily a windbreak, and when a scarf is wrapped around mouth and
nose, and the fur-edged hood of the parkee is pulled forward over cap
and scarf, the traveller who must face the wind has done all he can to
protect himself from it.

[Illustration: SUNRISE ON THE CHANDALAR-KOYUKUK PORTAGE.]

Unfortunately, in the confusion of striking the tent and packing in the
dark, my scarf had been rolled up in the bedding, and, since the wind
was not bad until we approached the Gap in the evening, I had not
troubled about it. Now, as we drew nearer and nearer, the wind rose
constantly. The thermometer was at 38° below zero, and wind at that
temperature cuts like a knife. But to get my scarf meant stopping the
whole procession and unlashing and unloading the sled, and the man who
unlashed in that wind would almost certainly freeze his fingers. So I
gave up the thought of it, turned my back to the wind while I tied my
pocket handkerchief round mouth and nose, drew the strings of my parkee
hood close, and then faced it again to worry through as best I could.
The ice is always swept clear of snow in the Gap. The river narrows
within its jaws, the ragged rocks rise up to the bluffs on either hand,
and the blue-streaked ice stretches between. We all suffered a good
deal. Against that cruel wind it was impossible to keep warm. The hands,
though enclosed in woollen gloves, and they in blanket-lined moose-hide
mitts, grew numb; the toes, within their protection of caribou sock with
the hair on, strips of blanket wrapping, and mukluks stuffed with hay,
tingled with warning of frost-bite; the whole body was chilled. We all
froze our faces, I think, for the part of the face around and between
the eyes cannot be covered. I froze my cheeks, my nose, and my Adam's
apple, the last a most inconvenient thing to freeze.

[Illustration: COLDFOOT ON THE KOYUKUK.]

[Sidenote: A COLD LODGING]

The cabin was just the other side of the Gap, and it was well that it
was no farther, for we were weary with our thirty-mile run and
dangerously cold with the exposure of the last hour. It was rather a
large cabin as trail cabins go, with a rickety sheet-iron stove in the
middle, burned full of holes, and it was hours before the fire began to
make any impression on the obstinate, sullen cold of that hut. When we
went to bed the frost still stood thick and heavy on the walls all over
the room. A log building, properly constructed, is a warm building, but
slowness in parting with heat means slowness in receiving heat, and a
log cabin that has been unoccupied for a long time in very cold weather
is hard to heat in one evening.

When we started next morning the thermometer stood at 45° below zero,
but we were out of the wind region and did not mind the cold. It is
curious that a few miles on either side of that Gap the air will be
still, while in the Gap itself a gale is blowing. Seven times I have
passed through that Gap and only once without wind. The great Flats were
now behind us, we had passed into the mountains, and for the remainder
of our long journey we should scarce ever be out of sight of mountains
again. Up the river, with its constant trouble of overflow, going around
the open water whenever we could, plunging through it in our mukluks
when it could not be avoided--with the care of the dogs' feet that the
cold weather rendered more than ever necessary when they got wet, and
the added nuisance of throwing the toboggans on their sides and beating
the ice from them with the flat of the axe wherever water had been
passed through--for two days we followed its windings, the thermometer
between -45° and -50°, the mountains rising higher and the scenery
growing more picturesque as we advanced. At the end of the second day
from the Gap we were at the mouth of the West Fork of the Chandalar, and
after passing up it for fifteen or sixteen miles we left that
watercourse to cross the mountains to the South Fork of the Koyukuk
River.

Then began hard labour again. A toboggan is not a good vehicle for
crossing summits. Its bottom is perfectly flat and smooth, polished like
glass by the friction of the snow. If the trail be at all "sidling" (and
mountain trails are almost always "sidling"), the toboggan swings off on
the side of the inclination and must be kept on the trail by main force.
The runners of a sled will grip the surface, if there be any
inequalities at all, but a toboggan swings now this way and now that,
like a great pendulum, dragging the near dogs with it. Again and again
we had to hitch both teams to one toboggan to get up a sidling pitch
while all hands kept the vehicle on the trail, and our progress was
painful and slow. In soft snow on a level surface like the river bed or
through the Flat country, generally, the toboggan is much the more
convenient vehicle, for it rides over the snow instead of ploughing
through it, but on hard snow anywhere or on grades the toboggan is a
nuisance. Thus wallowing through the deep snow at the side of the
toboggans to hold them in place we sweated and slaved our way mile after
mile up the gradual ascent until we reached the spot, just under a
shoulder of the summit, where there was dry spruce and green spruce for
camping, the dry for fire and the green for couch, and there we halted
for the night.

[Sidenote: JOHN MUIR]

Next morning we crossed the low pass and dropped down easily into the
wide valley of the Koyukuk South Fork, with a fine prospect of mountains
everywhere as far as the eye could see. I had stood and gazed upon those
same mountains on my journey of the previous winter, my first winter in
Alaska, and had seen a most remarkable sight. As we began the descent
and a turn of the trail gave a new panorama of peaks I did not at first
realise the nature of the peculiar phenomenon I was gazing at. Each peak
had a fine, filmy, fan-shaped cloud stretching straight out from it into
the sky, waving and shimmering as it stretched. The sun was not above
the horizon, but his rays caught these sheer, lawn-like streamers and
played upon them with a most delicate opalescent radiance. Then all at
once came to my mind the recollection of a description in John Muir's
_Mountains of California_ (surely the finest mountain book ever written)
of the snow banners of the Sierra Nevada, and I knew that I was looking
at a similar spectacle. It meant that a storm was raging on high,
although so far we were sheltered from it. It meant that the dry,
sand-like snow of the mountain flanks was driven up those flanks so
fiercely before the wind that it was carried clean over them and beyond
them out into the sky, and still had such pressure behind it that it
continued its course and spread out horizontally, thinning and spreading
for maybe a mile before it lost all coherence and visibility. As far as
I could see mountain peaks I could see the snow banners, all pointing
one way, all waving, all luminous and shimmering in the sun-rays. It was
a very noble sight, and I gazed a long while entranced, not knowing how
ominous it was. When we reached the valley and left the shelter of the
gulch we struck the full force of that fearful gale, and for two days
and nights of incessant blizzard we lay in a hole dug out of a sand-bank
(for we had no tent that year), the trail lost, the grub box nearly
empty, and no fire possible to cook anything with had the grub box been
full.

The valley before us--to resume the narrative--is a high, wind-swept
region of niggerhead and swamp, the catch-basin of the South Fork of the
Koyukuk River. The trail descends one of its southern draws, follows up
the main valley awhile, crosses it, and leaves by one of its northern
draws to pass over the mountains that separate its drainage from the
main fork of the Koyukuk. The cold had given place to wind, and though
the gale did not approach the fierceness of last year's storm, it gave
great trouble in following the track. These high headwater basins are
always windy; the timber is scrubby spruce with many open places, and in
such open places the trail is soon obliterated altogether.

When the light fails this casting about for blazes whenever a clump of
spruce is reached becomes increasingly slow and difficult and at last
becomes hopeless. The general direction determined, it might be thought
that the traveller could ignore the tracks of previous passage and
strike out for himself, but he knows that the trail, however rough, is
at least practicable, whereas an independent course may soon lead to
steep gullies or cut banks, or may entangle him in some thicket that he
must resort to the axe to pass through. Moreover, even two or three
passages through the snow in the winter will give some bottom to a
trail; a bottom that, when the wind-swept areas are passed and the
snow-shoes are resumed, both he and his dogs will be thankful for.

[Sidenote: CAMP MAKING]

So we made a camp as it darkened to night, not far from the spot where I
had "siwashed" with an Indian companion the previous winter, the wind
blowing half a gale at 20° below zero.

Making camp under such circumstances is always a very disagreeable
proceeding. It takes time and care to make a comfortable camp, and time
and care in the wind and the cold involve suffering. Two suitable trees
must be selected between which the tent is to be suspended by the
ridge-rope, and the snow must all be scraped away by the snow-shoes, or,
if it be too deep, beaten down. Then while one man unlashes and unpacks
the sleds, another cuts green spruce and lays it all over the tent
space, thicker and finer where the bed is to be. Then up goes the tent,
its corner ropes and its side strings made fast to boughs, if there be
such, or to stakes, or to logs laid parallel to the sides. Then the
stovepipe is jointed and the stove set up on the edge of green billets
properly shaped. Meanwhile the axe-man, the green boughs cut, has been
felling and splitting a dry tree for stove wood, and the whole
proceedings are rushed and hastened towards getting a fire in that
stove. Sometimes it is a question whether we shall get a fire before we
freeze our fingers or freeze our fingers before we get a fire. The fire
once going, we are safe, for however much more work there is in the
open, and there is always a good deal more, one can go to the tent to
get warm. Enough stove wood must be cut, not only for night and morning,
but for cooking the dog feed. The dog pot, filled with snow, into which
the fish are cut up, is put upon the outdoor fire as soon as man-supper
begins cooking in the tent. When it boils, the rice and tallow must be
added, and when the rice has boiled twenty minutes the whole is set
aside to cool. Meanwhile the two aluminum pots full of snow, replenished
from time to time as it melts, are put upon the stove in the tent as the
necessary preliminary to cooking. Sometimes ice, and more rarely water,
may be had, and then supper is hastened. If we are camped on the river
bank sometimes a steel-pointed rifle-bullet fired straight down into the
ice will penetrate to the water below and allow a little jet to bubble
up. Melting snow is a tedious business at best; but, since three times
out of four when camping it must be done, the aluminum pots are a
treasure. There is still work for every one as well as the cook. Snow
must be banked all round the tent to keep out the wind. Little heaps of
spruce boughs must be cut for the dogs' beds; it is all we can do for
them whatever the weather, and they appreciate it highly. It may be that
dog moccasins must be taken off and strung around the stove to dry, and
before supper is ready the inside ridge-rope of the tent is heavy with
all sorts of drying man-wear: socks, moccasins, scarfs, toques,
mittens. One of the earliest habits a man learns on the trail is to hang
up everything to dry as soon as he takes it off. Why should it be hung
up to dry unless it has got wet? the writer was once asked, in detailing
these operations. Because there is no other way to remove the ice with
which everything becomes incrusted in very cold weather.

[Sidenote: CAMP COOKING]

As his snow melts the cook throws into the pot a few handfuls of
evaporated potatoes, a handful of evaporated onions, and smaller
quantities of evaporated "soup vegetables," and leaves them to soak and
simmer and resume their original size and flavour. By and by he will cut
up the moose meat or the rabbits or birds, or whatever game he may have,
and throw it in, and in an hour or an hour and a half there will be a
savoury stew that, with a pan of biscuits cooked in an aluminum
reflector beside the stove and a big pot of tea, constitutes the
principal meal of the day. Or if the day has been long and sleep seems
more attractive even than grub, he will turn some frozen beans, already
boiled, into a frying-pan with a big lump of butter, and when his meat
is done supper is ready. Beans thus prepared eaten red hot with grated
cheese are delicious to a hungry man. With the stove for a sideboard,
food may always be eaten hot, and that is one advantage of camp fare.

The men satisfied, the dogs remain, and while two of the party wash
dishes and clean up, the third feeds the dogs. Their pot of food has
been cooling for an hour or more. They will not eat it until it is cold
and a mess of rice will hold heat a long time even in the coldest
weather. When it is nearly cold it is dished out with a paddle into the
individual pans and the dogs make short work of it. There are some who
feed straight fish, and, if the fish be king salmon of the best quality,
the dogs do well enough on it. But on any long run it is decidedly
economical to cook for the dogs--not so much from the standpoint of
direct cost as from that of weight and ease of hauling. An hundred
pounds of fish plus an hundred pounds of rice plus fifty pounds of
tallow will go a great deal farther than two hundred and fifty pounds of
fish alone. There is little doubt, too, that in the long run the dogs do
better on cooked food. It is easier of digestion and easier to apportion
in uniform rations. Rice and fish make excellent food. The Japs took
Port Arthur on rice and fish. The tallow answers a demand of the climate
and is increased as the weather grows colder. Man and dog alike require
quantities of fat food in this climate; it is astonishing how much bacon
and butter one can eat. When the dogs have eaten, and each one has made
the rounds of all the other pans to be sure nothing is left, they retire
to their respective nests of spruce bough and curl themselves up with
many turnings round and much rearranging of the litter. Feet and nose
are neatly tucked in, the tail is adjusted carefully over all, the hair
on the body stands straight up, and the dogs have gone to bed and do not
like to be disturbed again.

[Sidenote: DOG-HARNESS]

Therein lies the cruelty of depriving them of their tails, which used
to be the general custom in this country. The old tandem harness almost
required it, as the breath of the dog behind condensed upon the tail of
the dog in front until he was carrying around permanently a mass of ice
that was a burden to him and rendered his tail useless for warmth. But
the rig with a long mid rope, to which the dogs are attached by
single-trees in such manner that they may at will be hitched abreast or
one ahead of the other as the trail is wide or narrow, is superseding
the tandem rig, and one sees more bushy tails amongst the dogs. The
thick, long-haired tail of the dog in this country is indeed his
blanket, and in cold weather the tailless dog is at a great
disadvantage.

It was said that all the dogs retired to the nests of spruce bough; it
should have been all but one. It is Lingo's special charge to guard the
sled and his special privilege to sleep on it. Turning around and
curling up on the softest spot he can find of the unlashed and partly
unloaded toboggan, he will not touch anything it contains nor permit any
other dog to touch it.

The northern skies are clouded the next morning, the first day of the
new year, and there is a ruddy dawn that is glorious to behold. The
white earth gives back a soft rose tint, as an organ pipe gives back a
faint tone to the strong vibration of another pipe in pitch with it. We
shall not see the sun himself any more for many weeks, but we see his
light upon the flanks of the mountains for an hour or so around noon.
The bold, shapely peaks of the South Fork of the Koyukuk turn their
snows to pink fire as his rays slowly descend their sides, and the
whole scene is exquisitely beautiful. What a wonderful thing colour is!
When the skies are overcast this is a dead black-and-white country in
winter, for spruce, the prevailing wood, is black in the mass at a
little distance. Gaze where one will, there is naught but black and
white. The eye becomes tired of the monotony and longs for some warmer
tone. That is surely the reason why all those who live in the country
cherish some gay article of attire, why the natives love brilliant
handkerchiefs, why the white man also will choose a crimson scarf.
Trudging at the handle-bars, I have found pleasure in the red pompons of
the dogs' harness, in the gay beading of mitten and hind-sack. And that
is why a lavish feast of colour such as this dawn stirs one's spirit
with such keen delight. It gives life to a dead world.

But the wind is still bitter and interferes sadly with one's enjoyment.
All through the valley, up the creek by which we leave it, past the twin
lakes on the low summit, the wind grows in force, and when we leave
Slate Creek for the present and make a "portage" over a mountain
shoulder to strike the creek again much lower down, the wind has risen
to a gale that overturns the toboggans and makes the men fight for their
footing. The actual physical labour of it is enormous, and there can be
no rest; it is too bitterly cold in that blast to stop. For a mile or
two we struggle and slave to beat our way around that mountain shoulder
and then drop down to the creek again. The blessed relief it is to get
out of the fury of that wind into the comparative shelter of the creek,
to be done with the ceaseless toil of holding the heavy toboggans from
hurtling down the hillside, to be able to keep one's feet without
continually slipping and falling on the wind-hardened snow, no words can
adequately convey. We are all frozen again a little; this man's nose is
touched, that man's cheeks, and the other man's finger.

[Sidenote: THE KOYUKUK GOLD CAMP]

On the middle fork of the Koyukuk, at the mouth of Slate Creek, Coldfoot
sits within a cirque of rugged mountain peaks, the most northerly postal
town in the interior of Alaska, the most northerly gold-mining town in
the world, as it claims. It sprang into existence in 1900 and flourished
for a season or two with the usual accompaniments of such florification.
In 1906 it was already much decayed, and is now dead. Ever since its
start the Koyukuk camp has steadily produced gold and given occupation
to miners numbering from one hundred and fifty to three hundred, but the
scene of operations, and therefore the depot for supplies, has
continually changed. In 1900 the chief producing creek was Myrtle, which
is a tributary of Slate Creek, and the town at the mouth was in eligible
situation, though much over-built from the first. Then the centre of
interest shifted to Nolan Creek, fifteen miles farther up the river,
which is a tributary of Wiseman Creek, and the town of Wiseman sprang up
at the mouth of that creek. The post-office, the commissioner's office,
and the saloon, the stores and road-houses, migrated to the new spot,
and Coldfoot was abandoned. Now the chief producing creek is the Hammond
River, still farther up the Koyukuk, and if its placer deposits prove
as rich as they promise it is likely that a town will spring up at the
mouth of the Hammond which will supersede Wiseman.

There has never been found a continuous pay-streak in the Koyukuk camp.
It is what is known as a "pocket" camp. Now and again a "spot" is found
which enriches its discoverers, while on the claims above and below that
spot the ground may be too poor to work at a profit; for ground must be
rich to be worked at all in the Koyukuk. It is the most expensive camp
in Alaska, perhaps in the world. This is due to its remoteness and
difficulty of access. Far north of the Arctic Circle, the diggings are
about seventy-five miles above the head of light-draught steamboat
navigation, and more than six hundred miles above the confluence of the
Koyukuk with the Yukon. Transshipped at Nulato to the shoal-water
steamboats that make three or four trips a season up the Koyukuk,
transshipped again at Bettles, the head of any steamboat navigation,
freight must be hauled on horse scows the remaining seventy-five miles
of the journey; and all that handling and hauling means high rates. The
cost of living, the cost of machinery, the general cost of all mining
operations is much higher than on the Yukon or on the other tributaries
of that river. The very smallness of the camp is a factor in the high
prices, for there is not trade enough to induce brisk competition with
the reduction of rates that competition brings.

[Sidenote: MINERS' GENEROSITY]

Yet the smallness and the isolation of the camp have their
compensations. There is more community life, more _esprit de corps_
amongst the Koyukuk miners than will be found in any other camp in
Alaska. Thrown upon their own resources for amusement, social gatherings
are more common and are made more of, and hospitality is universal. Like
all sparsely settled and frontier lands, Alaska is a very hospitable
place in general, but the Koyukuk has earned the name of the most
hospitable camp in Alaska. Since the numbers are small, and each man is
well known to all the others, any sickness or suffering makes an
immediate appeal and brings a generous response. Again and again the
unfortunate victim of accident or disease has been sent outside for
treatment, the considerable money required being quickly raised by
public subscription. There is probably no other gold camp in the world
where it is a common thing for the owner of a good claim to tell a
neighbour who is "broke" to take a pan and go down to the drift and help
himself.

Until my visit of the previous year no minister of religion of any sort
had penetrated to the Koyukuk, and, save for one journey thither by
Bishop Rowe, my annual visits have been the only opportunities for
public worship since. It will suffice for the visit now describing as
well as for all the others to say that the reception was most cordial
and the opportunity much appreciated. We went from creek to creek and
gathered the men and the few women in whatever cabin was most
convenient, and no clergyman could wish for more attentive or interested
congregations.

[Illustration: THE UPPER KOYUKUK.]

Upon our return to Coldfoot from the creek visits the thermometer stood
at 52° below zero, although it had been no lower than 38° below when we
left the last creek, some fifteen miles away. As a general rule, the
temperature on these mountain creeks, which are at some considerable
elevation above the river into which they flow, will read from 10° to
15° higher than on the river, and if one climbed to the top of the peaks
around Coldfoot, the difference then would probably be 20° or 25°. At
the summit road-house between Fairbanks and Cleary City in the Tanana
country in cold weather the thermometer commonly reads 20° above the one
place and 10° or 15° above the other.

[Illustration: THE BARREN SHORES OF KOTZEBUE SOUND.]

[Sidenote: LINGO]

This interesting fact, which surprises a good many people, for we are
used to think of elevated places as cold places, is due to the greater
heaviness of cold air, which sinks to the lowest level it can reach; and
the river bed is the lowest part of the country. It would be interesting
to find out to what extent this rule holds good. The ridges and the
hilltops are always the warmest places in cold weather; would this hold
as regards mountain tops?--as regards high mountain tops? Probably it
would hold in the sunshine, but the rapid radiation of heat in the
rarefied atmosphere of mountain tops would swing the balance the other
way after dark. There is no doubt, however, that the coldest place in
cold weather in Alaska is the river surface, and it is on the river
surface that most of our travelling is done. The night we returned to
Coldfoot we put our toboggan up high on the roof of an outhouse to keep
its skin sides from the teeth of some hungry native dogs, leaving some
of the load that was not required within it, covered by the sled
cloth. Later on I saw by the light of the moon Lingo's silhouetted
figure sitting bolt upright on top of the sled, and he gave his short
double bark as I drew near to make me notice that he was still doing his
duty although under difficulties. The dog had climbed up a wood-pile and
had jumped to the top of the outhouse and so to the sled. I thought of
Kipling's _Men That Fought at Minden_:

        "For fatigue it was their pride
         And they would _not_ be denied
         To clean the cook-house floor."

Here at Coldfoot we came first into contact with that interesting tribe
of wandering inland Esquimaux known as the Kobuks, from their occupation
of the river of that name. The Koyukuk has its own Indian people, but
these enterprising Kobuks have pushed their way farther and farther from
salt water into what used to be exclusive Indian territory.
Representatives of both races were at Coldfoot, and as we lay
weather-bound for a couple of days, I was enabled to renew last year's
acquaintance with them, though without a good interpreter not much
progress was made. The delight of these people at the road-house
phonograph, the first they had ever heard, was some compensation for the
incessant snarl and scream of the instrument itself. It was very funny
to see them sitting on the floor, roaring with laughter at one
particularly silly spoken record of the "Uncle Josh at the World's Fair"
order. Over and over again they would ask for that record, and it never
ceased to convulse them with laughter. "He's been enjoyin' poor health
lately, but this mornin' I heard him complain that he felt a little
better"--how sick and tired we got of this and similar jokes drawled out
a dozen times running! The natives did not understand a word of it; it
was the human voice with its pronounced, unusual inflections that
aroused their merriment. The phonograph is becoming a powerful agency
for disseminating a knowledge of English amongst the natives throughout
Alaska, and one wishes that it were put to better use than the
reproduction of silly and often vulgar monologue and dialogue and trashy
ragtime music. As an index of the taste of those who purchase records,
the selection brought to this country points low.

The third day the thermometer stood at -49° and we were free to leave
without actually breaking the rule we had made after the escapade on the
Yukon. Two other teams were going down the river, so we started with
them on the sixty-five mile journey to Bettles. Twenty miles or so below
Coldfoot the Koyukuk passes for several miles in a narrow channel
between steep rock bluffs, with here and there great detached masses
standing in the middle of the river. One has a grotesque resemblance to
an aged bishop in his vestments and is known as the Bishop Rock; another
a more remote likeness to an Indian woman, and this is known as the
Squaw Rock. This part of the river, which is called the cañon of the
Koyukuk, though it is not a true cañon, is very picturesque, and because
of frequent overflow, offers glare ice and swift passage to the
traveller when it does not embarrass him with running water. We were
fortunate enough to pass it without getting our dogs' feet wet, and made
the half-way road-house in a brilliant moon that rendered travelling at
night pleasanter than during the day.

[Sidenote: TRAVELLING AT "50 BELOW"]

The next day we started again at near 50° below, but because there was a
good trail and a road-house for noon, the travelling was rather pleasant
than otherwise. If there be a warm house to break the day's march and
eat in, where ice-incrusted scarfs and parkees and caps and mittens may
be dried out, with a warm outhouse where the dogs may rest in comfort,
travelling in such weather is not too risky or too severely trying. The
continual condensation of the moisture from the breath upon everything
about the head and face is a decided inconvenience, and when it
condenses upon the eye-lashes, and the upper and the lower lashes freeze
together, the ice must be removed or it is impossible to open the eyes.
This requires the momentary application of the bare hand, and every time
it goes back into the mitten it carries some moisture with it, so that
after a while mittens are wet as well as head-gear; moreover, there is
always a certain perspiration that condenses. One gets into the habit of
turning the duffel lining of the moose-hide mitts inside out and hanging
them up the moment one gets inside a cabin. Round every road-house stove
there is a rack constructed for just that purpose.

There is no more striking phenomenon of the arctic trail than the
behaviour of smoke in cold weather. As one approaches a road-house, and
to greater degree a village or a town, it is seen enveloped in mist,
although there be no open water to account for it, and the prospect in
every other direction be brilliantly clear. It is not mist at all; it is
merely the smoke from the stovepipes. And the explanation is simple,
although not all at once arrived at. Smoke rises because it is warmer
than the air into which it is discharged; for that and no other reason.
Now, when smoke is discharged into air at a temperature of 50° below
zero, it is deprived of its heat immediately and falls to the ground by
its greater specific gravity. The smoke may be observed just issuing
from the pipe, or rising but a few feet, and then curling downward to be
diffused amidst the air near the ground.

It was to such a smoke-enveloped inn that we pulled up to warm and
refresh ourselves and our team for the twenty miles that remained of the
day's march. We had almost reached the limit of Koyukuk road-houses.
Bettles being the head of navigation, and merchandise late in the season
finding water too shallow for transport to the diggings, there is more
or less freighting with dog teams and horses all the winter. This travel
keeps open the road-houses on the route. From an "outside" point of view
they may appear rough and the fare coarse. The night accommodation is a
double row of bunks on each side of a long room with a great stove in
the middle. Sometimes there is straw in the bunks, sometimes spruce
boughs; in the better class even sometimes hay-stuffed mattresses. But
to the weary traveller, who has battled with the storm or endured the
intense cold for hours at a stretch, they are glad havens of refuge;
they are often even life-saving stations.

[Sidenote: METEOROLOGICAL]

While we lay at the road-house the clear sky clouded and the thermometer
rose. This is an unfailing sequence. Clear, bright weather is cold
weather; cloudy weather is warm weather. The usual explanation, that the
cloud acts as a blanket that checks the radiation of heat from the
earth, is one of those explanations that do not explain. There is no
heat to radiate. The cloud is a mass of moist air, which is warm air,
introducing itself from some milder region. So the cloud brings the
heat; and the lower layers of atmosphere extract it and thereby
discharge the moisture. For an hour or two around noon the thermometer
stood at -35° and there was a light fall of snow; then the skies cleared
because they were discharged of all their moisture, and the thermometer
went down to -50° again. It is a beautifully simple process and
sometimes takes place two or three times a day. Every time the sky
clouds, the thermometer rises; every time the sky clears, the
thermometer falls. And because the barometer gives notice of changes in
the density of the atmosphere, it is valuable in forecasting temperature
in our winters. A steady rise in the barometer means a steady fall in
the thermometer; a fall in the barometer in a time of great cold
infallibly prophesies warmer weather; even such rapid changes as the one
given above are anticipated. So well is this established, that during
"50°-below spells" at Fairbanks, impatient, weather-bound travellers and
freighters would busy the hospital telephone with inquiries about the
barometer, the hospital having the only barometer in the country.

After another long, cold run, on the night of Friday, the 12th of
January, we reached Bettles, the place we had planned to spend Christmas
at. We were unable to stir from Bettles for two solid weeks, for during
the whole of that time the thermometer never rose above 50° below zero.

The long wait at Bettles would have been excessively tedious had it not
been for the kind hospitality of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Grimm, the
Commercial Company's agent and his wife, and this is but one of many
times that I have been under obligation to them for cordial welcome and
entertainment, for needs anticipated, and every sort of assistance
gladly rendered. We had been expected many days; the Christmas
festivities with a gathering of natives of both races had come and gone;
still they looked for us, for in this country one does not give a man up
merely because he is a few weeks behind time, nor hold him to account
for unpunctuality. The natives remained for the most part, and there was
abundant opportunity of intercourse with them and some beginnings of
instruction. As the days passed and all arrangements for our advance
were made, we chafed more and more at the delay, for it was very plain
that the prospect of visiting Point Hope grew less and less; but this is
a great country for teaching patience and resignation.

[Sidenote: PARASELENÆ]

Some of the weather during that two weeks' wait was of quite exceptional
severity. One night is fixed for ever in my memory. It is a very rare
thing for the wind to blow in the "strong cold," but that night there
was a wind at 58° below zero. And high up in the heavens was a sight I
had never seen before. The moon, little past her full, had a great ring
around her, faintly prismatic; and equidistant from her, where a line
through her centre parallel with the horizon would cut the ring, were
two other moons, distinct and clear. It was a strangely beautiful thing,
this sight of three moons sailing aloft through the starry sky, as
though the beholder had been suddenly translated to some planet that
enjoys a plurality of satellites, but no living being could stand long
at gaze in that wind and that cold. A perfect paraselene is, I am
convinced, an extremely rare thing, much rarer than a perfect parhelion
("moon-cats" my companion thought the phenomenon should be called,
saving the canine simile for the sun), for in seven years' travel I have
never seen another, and the references to it in literature are few.

The next day at noon, the sun not visible above the distant mountains,
there appeared in the sky a great shining cross of orange light, just
over the sun's position, that held and shone for nigh an hour and only
faded with the twilight. It is not surprising that these appearances
should deeply impress the untutored mind and should be deemed
significant and portentous; they must deeply impress any normal mind,
they are so grand and so strange. The man who has trained his intellect
until it is so stale, and starved his imagination until it is so
shrivelled that he can gaze unmoved at such spectacles, that they are
insignificant to him, has but reduced himself to the level of the dog
upon whom also they make no impression--though even a dog will howl at a
great aurora. Of course we know all about them; any schoolboy can pick
up a primer of physical geography and explain the laws of refraction,
and the ugly and most libellous diagram of circles and angles that shows
just how these lustrous splendours happen; but the mystery beyond is not
by one hair's breadth impaired nor their influence upon the spectator
diminished. In Alaska perhaps more than any other country it is the
heavens that declare the glory of God and the firmament that shows His
handiwork, and the awestruck Indian who comes with timid inquiry of the
import of such phenomena is rightfully and scientifically answered that
the Great Father is setting a sign in the sky that He still rules, that
His laws and commandments shall never lose their force, whether in the
heavens above or on the earth beneath.

[Sidenote: THE STRONG COLD]

The "strong cold" itself is an awe-inspiring thing even to those who
have been familiar with it all their lives; and a dweller in other
climes, endowed with any imagination, may without much difficulty enter
into the feelings of one who experiences it for the first time. It
descends upon the earth in the brief twilight and long darkness of the
dead of winter with an irresistible power and an inflexible menace.
Fifty below, sixty below, even seventy below, the thermometer reads.
Mercury is long since frozen solid and the alcohol grows sluggish. Land
and water are alike iron; utter stillness and silence usually reign.
Bare the hand, and in a few minutes the fingers will turn white and be
frozen to the bone. Stand still, and despite all clothing, all woollens,
all furs, the body will gradually become numb and death stalk upon the
scene. The strong cold brings fear with it. All devices to exclude it,
to conserve the vital heat seem feeble and futile to contend with its
terrible power. It seems to hold all living things in a crushing
relentless grasp, and to tighten and tighten the grip as the temperature
falls.

Yet the very power of it, and the dread that accompanies it, give a
certain fearful and romantic joy to the conquest of it. A man who has
endured it all day, who has endured it day after day, face to face with
it in the open, feels himself somewhat the more man for the experience,
feels himself entered the more fully into human possibilities and
powers, feels an exultation that manhood is stronger even than the
strong cold. But he is a fool if ever he grow to disdain the enemy. It
waits, inexorable, for just such disdain, and has slain many at last who
had long and often withstood it.

On those rare occasions when there is any wind, any movement of the air
at all, there enters another and a different feeling. Into the menace of
a power, irresistible, inflexible, but yet insentient, there seems to
enter a purposeful, vengeful evil. It pursues. The cold itself becomes
merely a condition; the wind a deadly weapon which uses that condition
to deprive its victim of all defence. The warmth which active exercise
stores up, the buckler of the traveller, is borne away. His reserves
are invaded, depleted, destroyed. And then the wind falls upon him with
its sword. Of all of which we were to have instance here on the Koyukuk.

[Sidenote: "FOUND FROZEN"]

In the second week of our stay at Bettles, while Divine service was in
progress in the store building, crowded with whites and natives, the
door opened and, with an inrush of cold air that condensed the moisture
at that end of the room into a cloud and shot along the floor like steam
from an engine exhaust, there entered an Indian covered with rime, his
whole head-gear one mass of white frost, his snow-shoes, just removed,
under his arm, and a beaded moose-skin wallet over his shoulder. Every
eye was at once turned to him as he beat the frost from his parkee hood
and thrust it back, unwrapped fold after fold of the ice-crusted scarf
from his face, and pulled off his mittens. Seeking out the agent, he
moved over to him and whispered something in his ear. It was plain that
the errand was of moment and the message disturbing, and as I had lost
the attention of the congregation and the continuity of my own
discourse, I drew things to a close as quickly as I decently could. That
Indian had come seventy-five miles on snow-shoes in one run, without
stopping at all save to eat two or three times, at a continuous
temperature of 50° below zero or lower, to bring word that he had found
a white man frozen to death on the trail; and on the Koyukuk that feat
will always be counted to Albert the Pilot for righteousness. From the
location and description of the dead man, there was no difficulty in
identifying him. He was a wood-chopper under contract with the company
to cut one hundred cords of steamboat wood against next summer's
navigation at a spot about one hundred miles below Bettles. He had taken
down with him on the "last water" enough grub for about three months,
and was to return to Bettles for Christmas and for fresh supplies. After
a day or two's rest the Indian was sent back with instructions to bring
the body to a native village we should visit, to whipsaw lumber for a
coffin and dig a grave, and we engaged to give the body Christian
burial.

Uneasy at the softening muscles and sinews of this long inaction, I took
snow-shoes and a couple of Kobuks one day and made an ascent of the hill
behind Bettles known as Lookout Mountain, because from its top the smoke
of the eagerly expected first steamboat of the summer may be seen many
miles down the river; being moved to that particular excursion by
dispute among the weather-bound freighters as to the hill's height.

The change of temperature as we climbed the hill was striking. On the
first shoulder we were already out of the dense atmosphere of the valley
and above the smoke gloom of the houses, and as we rose the air grew
milder and milder, until at the top we emerged into the first sunshine
of many weeks and were in an altogether different climate--balmy and
grateful it was to us just come up from the strong cold. The aneroid
showed the altitude about seven hundred feet above Bettles, and I
regretted very much I had not brought the thermometer as well, for its
reading would have been most interesting.

The view from the top was brilliantly clear and far-reaching. The broad
plain across the river was checkered black and white with alternating
spruce thickets and lakes; beyond it and the mountains that bounded it
lay the valley of the south fork which we had crossed fifty or sixty
miles farther up on our journey hither. Right in front of us the middle
fork made its big bend from southwest to south, and to the left, that
is, to the north, the valley of the John River opened up its course
through the sharp white peaks of the Endicott Mountains. It was in this
direction that my eyes lingered longest. I knew that sixty or seventy
miles up this river we could cross the low Anaktuvak Pass into the
Anaktuvak River, which flows into the Colville, and that descending the
Colville we could reach the shores of the Northern Ocean. It was a
journey I had wished to make--and have wished ever since. There are many
bands of Esquimaux on that coast, never visited save by those who make
merchandise of them in one way or another. Please God, some day I should
get there; meanwhile our present hopes lay west, though, indeed, these
grew daily fainter.




CHAPTER III

BETTLES TO THE PACIFIC--THE ALATNA, KOBUK PORTAGE, KOBUK VILLAGE,
KOTZEBUE SOUND


ALL our preparations were long since made. Our Indian guide had been
sent back to Fort Yukon from Coldfoot, and here we engaged a young
Esquimau with his dog team and sled, to go across to Kotzebue Sound with
us. There was also a young Dane who wished to go from the Koyukuk
diggings to the diggings at Candle Creek on the Seward Peninsula, and
him we were willing to feed in return for his assistance on the trail.
The supplies had been carefully calculated for the journey, the
toboggans were already loaded, and we waited but a break in the cold
weather to start.

Our course from Bettles would lead us sixty-five miles farther down the
Koyukuk to the mouth of the Alatna. The visit to the native village and
the burial of the poor fellow frozen to death would take us ten miles
farther down than that, and we would return to the Alatna mouth. Then
the way would lie for fifty miles or so up that stream, and then over a
portage, across to the Kobuk River, which we should descend to its mouth
in Kotzebue Sound; the whole distance being about five hundred miles
through a very little travelled country. We learned indeed, that it had
been travelled but once this winter, and that on the first snow. It was
thought at Bettles that we might possibly procure some supplies at a
newly established mission of the Society of Friends about half-way down
the Kobuk River, but there was no certainty about it, and we must carry
with us enough man-food to take us to salt water. Our supply of dog fish
we might safely count upon replenishing from the natives on the Kobuk.
Another thing that caused some thought was the supply of small money.
There was no silver and no currency except large bills on the Koyukuk,
and we should need money in small sums to buy fish with. So the agent
weighed out a number of little packets of gold-dust carefully sealed up
in stout writing-paper like medicine powders, some worth a dollar, some
worth two dollars, the value written on the face, and we found them
readily accepted by the natives and very convenient. Two years later I
heard of some of those packets, unbroken, still current on the Kobuk.

At last, on the 26th of January, we got away. The thermometer stood only
a few degrees above -50° when we left, but the barometer had been
falling slowly for a couple of days, and I was convinced the cold spell
was over. With our three teams and four men we made quite a little
expedition, but dogs and men were alike soft, and for the first two days
the travel was laborious and slow; then came milder weather and better
going.

[Sidenote: THE KOYUKUK "TOWNS" OF '98]

We passed the two ruined huts of Peavey, the roofs crushed by the
superincumbent snow. In the summer of 1898 a part of the stream of gold
seekers, headed for the Klondike by way of Saint Michael, was deflected
to the Koyukuk River by reports of recent discoveries there. A great
many little steamboat outfits made their way up this river late in the
season, until their excessive draught in the falling water brought them
to a stand. Where they stopped they wintered, building cabins and
starting "towns." In one or two cases the "towns" were electrically lit
from the steamboat's dynamo. The next summer they all left, all save
those who were wrecked by the ice, and the "towns" were abandoned. But
they had got upon the map through some enterprising representative of
the land office, and they figure on some recent maps still. Peavey,
Seaforth, Jimtown, Arctic City, Beaver City, Bergman, are all just names
and nothing else, though at Bergman the Commercial Company had a plant
for a while.

We passed the mouth of the Alatna, where were two or three Indian
cabins, and went on the remaining ten miles to Moses' Village, where the
body of the man frozen to death had been brought. Moses' Village, named
from the chief, was the largest native village on the Koyukuk River, and
we were glad, despite our haste, that we had gone there. The repeated
requests from all the Indians we met for a mission and school on the
Koyukuk River and the neglected condition of the people had moved me the
previous year to take up the matter. This was my first visit, however,
so far down the river.

We found the coffin unmade and the grave undug, and set men vigorously
to work at both. The frozen body had been found fallen forward on hands
and feet, and since to straighten it would be impossible without
several days' thawing in a cabin, the coffin had to be of the size and
shape of a packing-case; of course the ground for the grave had to be
thawed down, for so are all graves dug in Alaska, and that is a slow
business. A fire is kindled on the ground, and when it has burned out,
as much ground as it has thawed is dug, and then another fire is
kindled. We had our own gruesome task. The body should be examined to
make legally sure that death came from natural causes. With difficulty
the clothes were stripped from the poor marble corpse, my companion made
the examination, and as a notary public I swore him to a report for the
nearest United States commissioner. This would furnish legal proof of
death were it ever required; otherwise, since there is no provision for
the travelling expenses of coroners, and the nearest was one hundred and
forty or one hundred and fifty miles away, there would have been no
inquest and no such proof.

[Sidenote: A WILDERNESS TRAGEDY]

The man had delayed his return to Bettles too long. When his food was
exhausted and he had to go, there came on that terrible cold spell. A
little memorandum-book in his pocket told the pitiful story. Day by day
he lingered hoping for a change, and day by day there was entry of the
awful cold. He had no thermometer, but he knew the temperature was -50°
or lower by the cracking noise that his breath made--the old-timer's
test. At last the grub was all gone and he must go or starve. The final
entry read: "All aboard to-morrow, hope to God I get there." The Indians
estimated that he had been walking two days, and had "siwashed it" at
night somewhere beside a fire in the open without bedding. Holes were
burned in his breeches in two places, where, doubtless, he had got too
near the fire. He had nothing whatever to eat with him save a piece of
bacon gnawed to the rind. There were only two matches in his pocket, and
they were mixed up with trash of birch-bark and tobacco, so it is likely
he did not know he had them. He had lit all the fires he could light and
eaten all the food he had to eat. Still he was plugging along towards
the native village nine miles away. Then he lost the trail, probably in
the dark, for it was faint and much drifted, and had taken off his
snow-shoes to feel with his moccasined feet for the hardened snow that
would indicate it. That was almost the end. He had gone across the river
and back again, feeling for the trail, and then, with the deadly
numbness already upon his brain, had wandered in a circle. The date of
his starting in the memorandum-book and the distance travelled made it
almost certain that, at some moment between the time when those three
moons floated in the sky and the time when that cross glared on the
horizon, he had fallen in the snow, never to rise again. Fifty-eight
below zero and a wind blowing!

One supposes that the actual death by freezing is painless, as it is
certainly slow and gradual. The only instance of sudden gelation I ever
heard of is in Longfellow's "Wreck of the Hesperus," where the skipper,
having answered one question, upon being asked another,

        "Answered never a word,
         For a frozen corpse was he."

But if the actual death be painless, the long conscious fight against it
must be an agony; for a man of any experience must realise the peril he
is in. The tingling in fingers and toes and then in knees and elbows is
a warning he recognises only too well. He knows that, unless he can
restore warmth by restoring the circulation, he is as good as frozen
already. He increases his pace and beats his arms against his breast.
But if his vitality be too much reduced by hunger and fatigue and cold
to make more than a slight response to the stimulation, if the distance
to warmth and shelter be too great for a spurt to carry him there, he is
soon in worse case than before. Then the appalling prospect of perishing
by the cold must rise nakedly before him. The enemy is in the breach,
swarming over the ramparts, advancing to the heart of the fortress, not
to be again repelled. He becomes aware that his hands and feet are
already frozen, and presently there may be a momentary terrible
recognition that his wits begin to wander. Frantically he stumbles on,
thrashing his body with his arms, forcing his gait to the uttermost, a
prey to the terror that hangs over him, until his growing horror and
despair are mercifully swallowed up in the somnolent torpidity that
overwhelms him. All of us who have travelled in cold weather know how
uneasy and apprehensive a man becomes when the fingers grow obstinately
cold and he realises that he is not succeeding in getting them warm
again. It is the beginning of death by freezing.

We buried the body on a bench of the bluff across the river from the
native village, the natives all standing around reverently while the
words of committal were said, and set up a cross marked with
lead-pencil: "R. I. P.--Eric Ericson, found frozen, January, 1906." Two
or three years later a friend sent me a small bronze tablet with the
same legend, and that was affixed to the cross. There are many such
lonely graves in Alaska, for scarce a winter passes that does not claim
its victims in every section of the country. That same winter we heard
of two men frozen on the Seward Peninsula, two on the Yukon, one on the
Tanana, and one on the Valdez trail. This day I recorded a temperature
of 10°, the first plus temperature in thirty-nine days, and that
previous rise above zero was the first in twenty days.

[Sidenote: NEGLECTED NATIVES]

That night we gathered all the natives, and after long speech with poor
interpretation I ventured to promise them a mission the next year. Some
of them had been across to the Yukon years before and had visited the
mission at Tanana. Some had been baptized there. Some had never seen a
clergyman or missionary of any sort before, and had never heard the
gospel preached. We were touched by one old blind woman who told of a
visit to a mission on the Yukon, and how she learned to sing a hymn
there. Her son interpreted: "She say every night she sing that hymn for
speak to God." She was encouraged to sing it, and it turned out to be
the alphabet set to a tune! After much pleading and with some
hesitation, I baptized seventeen children, comforting myself with the
assurance of the coming mission, which would undertake their Christian
training and instruction.

Back next day at the mouth of the Alatna, I was again impressed with the
eligibility of that spot as a mission site. It was but ten miles above
the present native village, and, with church and school established, the
whole population would sooner or later move to it. This gives
opportunity for regulating the building of cabins, and the advantage of
a new, clean start. Moreover, the Alatna River is the highway between
the Kobuk and the Koyukuk, and the Esquimaux coming over in increasing
numbers, would be served by a mission at this place as well as the
Indians. I foresaw two villages, perhaps, on the opposite sides of the
river--one clustered about the church and the school, the other a little
lower down--where these ancient hereditary enemies might live side by
side in peace and harmony under the firm yet gentle influence of the
church. So I staked a mission site, and set up notices claiming ground
for that purpose, almost opposite the mouth of the Alatna, which, in the
native tongue, is Allakaket or Allachaket.

[Sidenote: THE INLAND ESQUIMAUX]

There was some trail up the Alatna and we made fair headway on its
surface, stopping two nights at Kobuk huts. We are out of the Indian
country now, and shall see no more Indians until we are back on the
Yukon. The mode of life, the habits, the character of the races are very
different--the first Esquimau habitation we visited proclaiming it.
These inland Esquimaux, though some of the younger ones have never seen
salt water--our guide, Roxy, for one--are still essentially a salt-water
people. Their huts, even in the midst of trees, are half-underground
affairs, for they have not learned log-building; the windows are of
seal gut, and seal oil is a staple article of their diet. Their clothing
is also marine, their parkees of the hair-seal and their mukluks of the
giant seal. Communications are always kept up with the coast, and the
sea products required are brought across. The time for the movement of
the Kobuks back and forth was not quite yet, though we hoped we should
meet some parties and get the benefit of their trail. Just before we
left the Alatna River we stopped at Roxy's fish cache and got some green
fish, hewing them out of the frozen mass with the axe. The young man had
fished here the previous summer, had cached the fish caught too late to
dry in the sun, and they had remained where he left them for four or
five months. Most of them had begun to decay before they froze, but that
did not impair their value as dog food, though it rendered the cooking
of them a disagreeable proceeding to white nostrils. This caching of
food is a common thing amongst both natives and whites, and it is rarely
that a cache is violated except under great stress of hunger, when
violation is recognised as legitimate. Doughty, in his _Arabia Deserta_,
mentions the same custom amongst the Arabs; Sven Hedin amongst the
Tartars. Sparsely peopled waste countries have much the same customs all
over the world. Even the outer garb in the Oriental deserts has much
resemblance to our parkee; both burnoose and parkee are primarily
windbreaks, and it makes little difference whether the wind be charged
with snow or sand.

At midday on the 3d of February we left the Alatna River and took our
way across country for the Kobuk. We had now no trail at all save what
had been made a couple of months before by the only other party that had
crossed the portage this winter, and it was buried under fifteen or
sixteen inches of snow. There was quite a grade to be climbed to reach
the plateau over which our course lay, and the men, with rope over the
shoulder, had to help the dogs hauling at the sled. Indeed, over a good
deal of this portage, from time to time, the men had to do dog work, for
the country is rolling, one ridge succeeding another, and the loose,
deep snow made heavy and slow going. One man must go ahead breaking
trail, and that was generally my task, though when the route grew
doubtful and the indications too faint for white man's eye, Roxy took my
place and I took his gee pole, and slipped his rope around my chest.

Breaking trail would not be so laborious if one could wear the large
snow-shoes that are used for hunting. But the hunting shoe, though it
carries the man without fatigue, does not help the dogs. The small shoe
known as the trail shoe, packs the snow beneath it, and by the time the
trail breaker has gone forward, then back again, and then forward once
more, the snow is usually packed hard enough to give the dogs some
footing. Footing the dog must have or he cannot pull; a dog wallowing in
snow to his belly cannot exert much traction on the vehicle behind him.
The notion of snow-shoeing as a sport always seems strange to us on the
trail, for to us it is a laborious necessity and no sport at all. The
trail breaker thus goes over most of the ground thrice, and when he is
anxious at the same time to get a fairly accurate estimate by the
pedometer of the distance travelled, he must constantly remember to
upend the instrument in his pocket when he retraces his steps, and
restore it to its recording position when he attacks unbroken snow
again. Also he must take himself unawares, so to speak, from time to
time, and check the length of his stride with the tape measure and alter
the step index as the varying surfaces passed over require.
Conscientiously used, with due regard to its limitations, the pedometer
will give a fair approximation of the length of a journey, but a man can
no more tell how far he has gone by merely hanging a pedometer in his
pocket than he can tell the height above sea-level of an inland mountain
by merely carrying an aneroid barometer to the top.

[Sidenote: THE SUNRISE AND THE MOUNTAINS]

It was on this Alatna-Kobuk portage that we saw the most magnificent
sunrise any of us could remember. It had been cloudy for some days with
threat of snow which did not fall. We were camped in a little hollow
between two ridges, and I had been busy packing up the stuff in the tent
preparatory to the start, when I stepped out with a load of bedding in
my arms, right into the midst of the spectacle. It was simple, as the
greatest things are always simple, but so gorgeous and splendid that it
was startling. The whole southeastern sky was filled with great luminous
bands of alternate purple and crimson. At the horizon the bands were
deeper in tone and as they rose they grew lighter, but they maintained
an unmixed purity of contrasting colour throughout. I gazed at it until
the tent was struck and the dogs hitched and it was time to start, and
then I had to turn my back upon it, for our course lay due west, and I
was breaking trail. But on the crest of the rising ground ahead there
burst upon my delighted eyes a still more astonishing prospect. We were
come to the first near view of the Kobuk mountains, and the reflected
light of that gorgeous sunrise was caught by the flanks of a group of
wild and lofty snow peaks, and they stood up incandescent, with a vivid
colour that seemed to come through them as well as from them. To right
and left, mountains out of the direct path of that light gave a soft
dead mauve, but these favoured peaks, bathed from base to summit in
clear crimson effulgence, glowed like molten metal. It was not the
reflected light of the sun, but of the flaming sky, for even as I
looked, a swift change came over them. They passed through the tones of
red to lightest pink, not fading but brightening, and before my
companions reached me the sun's rays sprang upon the mountains from the
horizon, and they were golden.

It seems almost foolish to the writer and may well seem tedious to the
reader, to attempt in words the description of such scenes; yet so deep
is the impression they produce, and so large the place they take in the
memory, that to omit them would be to strike out much of the charm and
zest of these arctic journeys. Again and again in the years that have
passed, the recollection of that pomp of colour on the way to the Kobuk
has come suddenly upon me, and always with a bounding of the spirit. I
can shut my eyes now and see that incomparable sunrise; I can see again
that vision of mountains filling half the sky with their unimaginable
ardency, and I think that this world never presented nobler sight.
Surely for its pageantry of burning, living colour, for purity and depth
and intensity of tint, the Far North with its setting of snow surpasses
all other regions of the earth.

[Sidenote: TRAVELLING KOBUK LADS]

That same day we met a couple of Kobuk youths on their way to the
Koyukuk, and they gave us the greatest gift it was in the power of man
to give us--a trail! There is no finer illustration of the mutual
service of man to man than the meeting of parties going opposite ways
across the unbroken snows. Each is at once conferring and receiving the
greatest of favours, without loss to himself is heaping benefit on the
other; is, it may be--has often been--saving the other, and being
himself saved. No more hunting and peering for blazes, no more casting
about hither and thither when open stretches are crossed; no more three
times back and forth to beat the snow down--twenty miles a day instead
of ten or twelve--the boys' trail meant all that to us. And our trail
meant almost as much to them. So we were rejoiced to see them, sturdy
youths of sixteen or seventeen, making the journey all by themselves. My
heart goes out to these adventurous Kobuks, amiable, light-hearted,
industrious; keen hunters, following the mountain-sheep far up where the
Indian will not go; adepts in all the wilderness arts; heirs of the
uncharted arctic wastes, and occupying their heritage. If I were not a
white man I would far rather be one of these nomadic inland Esquimaux
than any other native I know of.

That same day we crossed two headwater forks of the Kokochatna, as the
Kobuks call it, or the Hogatzitna as the Koyukuks call it, or the Hog
River, as the white men call it, a tributary of the Koyukuk that comes
in about one hundred and fifty miles below the Alatna. As we came down a
steep descent to the little east fork, it showed so picturesque and
attractive, with clumps of fine open timber on an island, that it
remains in my mind one of the many places from the Grand Cañon of the
Colorado almost to the Grand Cañon of the Noatak, where I should like to
have a lodge in the vast wilderness.

We had but crossed the west fork when we knew that we were close to the
watershed between the Kobuk and the Koyukuk, between the streams that
fall into Kotzebue Sound and those that fall by the Koyukuk and the
Yukon Rivers into Bering Sea; and because it seemed a capital geographic
feature, it was disappointing that it was so inconspicuous. Indeed, we
were not sure which of two ridges was the actual divide. Beyond those
ridges there was no question, for the ground sloped down to Lake
Noyutak, a body of water some three and a half miles in length and of
varying breadth that drains into the Kobuk. Here in a cabin we found
three more young Kobuks, and spent the night, getting our first view of
the Kobuk River next day, not from an eminence, as I had hoped, but only
as we came down a bank through thick timber and opened suddenly upon it.
By the pedometer I made the portage forty-six miles.

[Sidenote: THE KOBUK RIVER]

The upper Kobuk is a picturesque river, the timber being especially
large and handsome for interior Alaska. We reached it just above the
mouth of the Reed River, tributary from the north. The weather was
warm--too warm for good travelling--the thermometer standing at 15­­­°,
20°, and one day even 30° above zero all day long, so that we were all
bareheaded and in our shirt-sleeves. From time to time, as the course of
the river varied, we had distant views of the rocky mountains of the
Endicott Range, or, as it might be written, the Endicott Range of the
Rocky Mountains, for such, in fact, it is--the western and final
extension of the great American cordillera. On the other side of those
mountains was the Noatak River, flowing roughly parallel with the Kobuk,
and discharging into the same arm of the sea.

The division of the labour of camping amongst four gave us all some
leisure at night, and I found time to read through again _The Cloister
and the Hearth_ and _Westward Ho!_ with much pleasure, quite agreeing
with Sir Walter Besant's judgment that the former is one of the best
historical novels ever written. There are few more attractive roysterers
in literature to me than Denys of Burgundy, with his "_Courage,
camarades, le diable est mort!_" This matter of winter reading is a
difficult one, because it is impossible to carry many books. My plan is
to take two or three India-paper volumes of classics that have been read
before, and renew my acquaintance with them. But reading by the light of
one candle, though it sufficed our forefathers, is hard on our
degenerate eyes.

The days were much lengthened now, and the worst of the winter was
done. There would still be cold and storm, but hardly again of the same
intensity and duration. When the traveller gets well into February he
feels that the back of the winter is broken, for nothing can take from
him the advantage of the ever-lengthening days, the ever-climbing sun.

On the afternoon of the third day on the Kobuk we reached a cabin
occupied by two white men, the first we had seen since we left Bettles,
and we were the first white men they had seen all the winter. They were
waiting for the spring, having a prospecting trip in view; simply
spending the winter eating up their grub. There was nothing whatever to
read in the cabin, and they had been there since the freeze-up! They
welcomed us, and we stayed overnight with them, and that night there was
a total eclipse of the moon, of which we had a fine view. We had an
almanac which gave the time of totality at Sitka, and we knew the
approximate longitude of our position, so we were able to set our
watches by it.

The next two days are noted in my diary as two of the pleasantest days
of the whole journey--two of the pleasantest days I ever spent anywhere,
I think. A clear, cloudless sky, brilliant sunshine, white mountain
peaks all about us, gave picture after picture, and the warm, balmy air
made travelling a delight. There are few greater pleasures than that of
penetrating into a new country, with continually changing views of
beauty, under kindly conditions of weather and trail. In the yellow rays
of the early sun, the spruce on the river bank looked like a screen of
carved bronze, while the slender stems of birches in front of the
spruce looked like an inlaying of old ivory upon the bronze, the whole
set upon its pedestal of marble-like snow. The second day we took a
portage of nine or ten miles across a barren flat and struck the river
again just below a remarkable stretch of bank a mile or so in length,
with never a tree or a bush or so much as the smallest shrub growing on
it. Thick timber above suddenly ceased, thick timber below suddenly
began again, and this bare bank reached back through open, barren flat
to a low pass in the mountains. It was a bank of solid ice, so we were
told later, and I remembered to have heard of ice bluffs on the Kobuk,
and wished that the portage had struck the river above this spot instead
of below it, that there might have been opportunity to examine it.

[Sidenote: THE MISSION]

[Sidenote: ENGLISH AND ESQUIMAU]

A little farther down the river and we were at the new mission of the
Society of Friends, where a cordial reception awaited us and, luxury of
luxuries, a warm bath! Again and again the wash-tub was emptied and
fresh water was heated until we all had wallowed to our heart's content.
The rude log buildings of the mission had been begun the previous fall,
and were not yet complete, but they were advanced enough for occupation,
and the work of the mission went actively on. It was in charge of rather
an extraordinary man. He gave us a sketch of his life, which was full of
interest and matter for thought. For many years he was a police officer
and jailer in the West. Then he sailed on a whaler and thus became
acquainted with the Esquimaux. He was converted from a life of
drunkenness and debauchery--though one fancied his character was not
really ever so bad as he painted it--at a "Peniel" mission in a
Californian town. He went in out of mere idle curiosity, just recovered
from a spree, and was so wrought upon that when he came out he was a
different creature, a new man, the old life with its appetite for
vicious indulgence sloughed off and left behind him, and he now
possessed with a burning desire to do some such active service for God
as aforetime he had done for the devil. After three or four months of
some sort of training in an institution maintained by the California
Society of Friends--a body more like the Salvation Army, one judges,
than the old Quakers--he volunteered for service at a branch which the
old-established mission of the Society at the mouth of the Kobuk desired
to plant two hundred miles or so up the river, and had come out and had
plunged at once into his task. So here he was, some six or seven months
installed, teacher, preacher, trader in a small way, and indefatigable
worker in general. Pedagogical training or knowledge of "methods" he had
none at all, but the root of the matter was in him, and surely never was
such an insatiable school-teacher. Morning, noon, and night he was
teaching. While he was cooking he was hearing lessons; while he was
washing the dishes and cleaning the house he was correcting exercises in
simple addition. In the schoolroom he was full of a genial enthusiasm
that seemed to impart instruction by sheer dynamic force. "Boot," the
lesson book said. There was no boot in the schoolroom, all were shod in
mukluks. He dives into his dwelling-house attachment and comes back
holding up a boot. "Boot," he says, and "boot" they all repeat.
Presently the word "tooth" was introduced in the lesson. Withdrawing a
loose artificial tooth of the "pivot" variety from his upper jaw, he
holds it aloft and "tooth!" he cries out, and "toot!" they all cry, and
he claps it back into his head again.

We were present on Sunday at the services. There was hearty singing of
"Pentecostal" hymns with catchy refrains, but we were compelled to
notice again what we had noticed amongst the little bands of these
people on the Koyukuk when we set them to singing, that the English was
unintelligible; and since it conveyed no meaning to us could have had
little for them. This is the inevitable result of ignoring the native
tongue and adopting the easy expedient of teaching the singing of hymns
and the recitation of formulas like the commandments in English. For a
generation or two, at least, the English learned, save by children at a
boarding-school, where nothing but English is spoken, is fragmentary and
of doubtful import in all except the commonest matters of speech. And at
such boarding-schools there is danger of the real misfortune and
drawback of natives growing up to live their lives amongst natives,
ignorant of the native tongue. There is no quick and easy way of
stamping out a language, thank God; there is no quick and easy way of
imparting instruction in a foreign language. By and by all the Alaskan
natives will be more or less bilingual, but the intimate speech and the
most clearly understood speech will still be the mother tongue. The
singing done, there was preaching through an interpreter, and then each
individual present "gave testimony," which consisted for the most part
in the recitation of a text of Scripture. Then there were individual
prayers by one and another of the congregation, and then some more
singing. The only hymn I could find in the book that I knew was the fine
old hymn, "How Firm a Foundation," and that was sung heartily to the
"Adeste Fideles." They are naturally a musical race, picking up airs
with great facility, and they thoroughly enjoy singing.

[Sidenote: THE "DOUBLE STANDARD"]

After the service the missionary confided some of his troubles to me. He
had lately learned through his interpreter that the burden of most of
the individual prayers was that the supplicator might "catch plenty
skins" and be more successful in hunting than his fellows; and though he
had done his best to impress upon them the superior importance of making
request for spiritual benefit, he was afraid they had made no change.
"Our people 'outside,'" he said, "don't understand these folk, and I'm
not sure that I thoroughly understand them myself." "They're all
'converted,'" he said; "they all claim to have experienced a change of
heart, but some of them I know are not living like converted people, and
sometimes I have my doubts about most of them." My sympathy went out to
him in his loneliness and his earnestness and his disappointments. I
pointed out that the emotional response to emotional preaching was
comparatively easy to get from any primitive people, but that to change
their whole lives, to uproot old customs of sensual indulgence, to
engraft new ideas of virtue and chastity was a long, slow process
anywhere in the world. It was chiefly in the matter of sexual morality
that his doubts and difficulties lay, and I was able to assure him that
his experience was but the common experience of all those who had
laboured for the uplifting of savage people. Indeed, how should it be
otherwise? Until quite lately there was almost promiscuous use of women.
A man receiving a traveller in his dwelling overnight proffered his wife
as a part of his hospitality; the temporary interchange of wives was
common; young men and young women gratified themselves without rebuke;
children were valuable however come by, and there was no special
distinction between legitimate and illegitimate offspring. As one
reflects on these conditions and then looks back upon conditions amongst
white people, it would seem that all the civilised races have done is to
set up a double standard of sexual morality as against the single
standard of the savage. It can hardly be claimed that the average white
man is continent, or even much more continent than the average Esquimau,
but he has forced continence upon the greater part of his women,
reserving a dishonoured remnant for his own irresponsible use. And there
are signs that some of those who nowadays inveigh against the white
man's double standard are in reality desirous of substituting, not the
single standard of the Christian ideal, but the single standard of the
savage. In the mining camps the prostitute has a sort of
half-way-recognised social position, and in polite parlance is referred
to as a "sporting lady"--surely the most horribly incongruous phrase
ever coined; she often marries a miner who will tell you that she is as
good as he is, and she is received afterwards by all but a few as a
"respectable married woman."

There had been some trouble of this sort at this mission. The great
northern gold seekers' wave of '97 and '98 threw a numerous band of
prospectors up the Kobuk as well as up the Koyukuk. The wave had receded
and left on the Kobuk but one little pool behind it, a handful of men
who found something better than "pay" on the Shungnak, a few miles away.
And there was much criticism of the missionary's methods amongst them.
Word of the arrival of strangers had brought some of them to Long Beach,
and on Sunday night I had opportunity of addressing them, with a view to
enlisting their sympathy, if possible. What if mistakes were made, what
if some of the methods employed were open to question? Here was a man
who beyond doubt was earnestly labouring in the best way he knew for the
improvement of these natives. Such an effort demanded the co-operation
of every right-feeling man.

[Sidenote: PERSONAL CLEANLINESS]

After all, however grand the physical scenery, the meteorological
phenomena, may be, the people of any country are the most interesting
thing in it, and we found these Esquimaux extraordinarily interesting.
Dirty they certainly are; it is almost impossible for dwellers in the
arctic regions to be clean in the winter, and the winter lasts so long
that the habit of winter becomes the habit of the year. White and native
alike accept a lower standard of personal cleanliness than is tolerated
outside. I remember asking Bishop Rowe, before I came to Alaska: "What
do you do about bathing when you travel in the winter?" To which he
replied laconically: "Do without." It is even so; travellers on the
Alaskan trails as well as natives belong to the "great unwashed." In the
very cold weather the procuring of water in any quantity is a very
difficult thing even for house dwellers. Every drop of it has to be
carried from a water-hole cut far out on the ice, up a steep grade, and
then quite a little distance back to the dwelling--for we do not build
directly upon these eroding banks. The water-hole is continually
freezing up and has to be continually hewed free of ice, and as the
streams dwindle with the progress of winter, new holes must be cut
farther and farther out. On the trail, where snow must usually be melted
for water, it is obvious that bathing is out of the question; even the
water for hands and face is sparingly doled by the cook, and two people
will sometimes use the same water rather than resort to the painful
though efficient expedient of washing with snow. If this be so despite
aluminum pots and a full kit of camp vessels, it is much more so with
the native, whose supply of pots and pans is very limited. I have seen a
white man melt snow in a frying-pan, wash hands and face in it, throw it
out, fry bacon and beans in it, then melt more snow and wash his cup and
plate in it. There is, however, this to be said anent the disuse of the
bath in this country, that in cold weather most men perspire very little
indeed, and the perspiration that is exuded passes through to the outer
garments and is immediately deposited upon them as frost; and there is
this further to be said about dirt in general, that one blessed property
of the cold is to kill all odours.

One grows tolerant of dirt in this country; there is no denying it, and
it is well that it is so; otherwise one would be in a chronic state of
disgust with oneself and every one else. So the dirt of the native,
unless specially prominent and offensive, is accepted as a matter of
course and ignored. This obstacle overcome, the Esquimaux are an
attractive and most interesting race, and compare to advantage with the
Indians in almost every particular. They are a very industrious people.
Go into an Esquimau's hut at almost any time when they are not sleeping,
and you will find every individual occupied at some task. Here is a man
working in wood or bone with the ingenious tools they have evolved; here
are women working in skin or fur, and some of them are admirable
needlewomen; here, perhaps, is another woman chewing mukluks--and many a
white man who has kept his feet dry in overflow water is grateful to the
teeth that do not disdain this most effective way of securing an
intimate union between sole and upper. Even the children are busy: here
is a boy whittling out bow and arrow--and they do great execution
amongst rabbits and ptarmigan with these weapons that entail no cost of
powder and shot; here is a girl beating out threads from sinew with a
couple of flat stones. Some of us, troubled with unconscientious
tailors, wish that a law could be passed requiring all buttons to be
sewn on with sinew--they never come off.

[Sidenote: A LIGHT-HEARTED FOLK]

They are a very light-hearted people, easily amused, bubbling over with
laughter and merriment, romping and skylarking with one another at every
intermission of labour. One of my white travelling companions on this
journey was in the habit of using a little piece of rabbit skin to
protect his nose in cold or windy weather. The care of the nose is
sometimes very troublesome indeed, it freezes more readily than any
other portion of the body; and a little piece of rabbit skin, moistened
and applied to the nose, will stay there and keep it warm and
comfortable all day. But it does not exactly enhance one's personal
attractions.

We had stopped for camp and were all together for the first time in four
or five hours, when Roxy noticed this rabbit-skin nose protector, upon
which the breath had condensed all the afternoon until two long icicles
depended from it, one on each side, reaching down below the mouth; and
he fell straightway into a fit of laughter that grew uncontrollable; he
rolled on the snow and roared. A little annoyed at this exhibition, I
spoke sharply: "What's the matter with you, Roxy; what on earth are you
cutting up like that for?" Checking himself for a moment, he pointed to
my companion and said, "Alleesame _walrus_," and went off into another
paroxysm of laughter, rolling about and roaring. At intervals all the
evening he would break out again, and when we sat down to eat it
overcame him once more and he rushed outside where he could give vent to
his mirth with less offence.

The boy was straightforward and conscientious. We were camped over
Sunday once, and Roxy had noticed many marten tracks in the
neighbourhood. He had brought a few traps along with him to set out as
we went and pick up on his return, and he wanted to know if I thought he
might set some that day, although it was the day of rest. Careful not to
interfere in any way with the religious instruction any native has
received from any source, I told him that was a matter for him to decide
himself; that each man was responsible for his own conduct. The boy
thought awhile--and he did not set his traps. Now that young man had
never received any instruction at a mission; all his teaching had been
from other Esquimaux. This same question of working on Sunday was the
cause of some of the difficulty between the missionary at Long Beach and
the miners at Shungnak. The sluicing or "cleaning-up" season is short,
and mining operators generally consider that they cannot afford to lose
an hour of it. The Kobuks employed by these miners quit their work on
Sunday, and that brought the operations to a standstill. There was
something to be said on the miners' side, but I rejoiced that the
Esquimau boys showed such steadfastness to their teaching. "If you
cannot use them six days in the week, if it has to be seven or none,
then do as the miners on the Yukon side do, consider the country
uninhabited, and make your arrangements as though there were no Kobuks."
That was my advice, and this may be read in connection with Mr.
Stefanson's caustic comments on the same rigidity of observance.

We left Long Beach with a grateful feeling for the hospitality with
which we had been received and with a substantial respect for the
earnest missionary effort that was being put forth there. We were able
to replenish our grub supply and also to exchange our two toboggans for
one large sled, for we were out of the toboggan country again and they
had already become a nuisance, slipping and sliding about on the trail.
Our host was up early with a good breakfast for us, and speeded the
parting guest, which on the trail is certainly an essential part of true
hospitality, with all the honours; the natives lined up on the bank and
the younger ones running along with us for a few hundred yards.

[Sidenote: THE JADE MOUNTAINS]

Soon after we left the mission we went up a series of terraces to a
desolate, barren, wind-swept flat, the portage across which cut off a
great bend of the river and saved us many miles of travel. To our right
rose the Jade Mountains, whence the supply of this stone which used to
be of importance for arrow-heads and other implements was obtained and
carried far and wide. A light crust on the snow broke through at every
step, though the snow was not deep enough and the ground too uneven to
make snow-shoes useful; so we all had more or less sore feet that night
when we regained the river and made our camp near the mouth of the
Ambler, another tributary from the north.

The next day was an exceedingly long, tedious day. The Kobuk River,
which in its upper reaches is a very picturesque stream, began now to be
as monotonous as the lower Yukon. It had grown to considerable size, and
the bends to be great curves of many miles at a stretch, one of which,
a decided bend to the north of the general westerly direction of the
river, we were three full hours in passing down. It was while traversing
this bend that we witnessed a singular mirage that lent to the day all
the enlivenment it had. Before us for ten or twelve miles stretched the
broad white expanse of the river bed, shimmering in the mellow sunlight,
and far beyond, remote but clear, rose the sharp white peaks of the
mountains that divide the almost parallel valleys of the Kobuk and the
Noatak. As we travelled, these distant peaks began to take the most
fantastic shapes. They flattened into a level table-land, and then they
shot up into pinnacles and spires. Then they shrank together in the
middle and spread out on top till they looked like great domed
mushrooms. Then the broad convex tops separated themselves entirely from
their stalk-like bases and hung detached in the sky with daylight
underneath. And then these mushroom tops stretched out laterally and
threw up peaks of their own until there were distinct duplicate ranges,
one on the earth and one in the sky. It was fascinating to watch these
whimsical vagaries of nature that went on for hours. A change in one's
own position, from erect to stooping, caused the most convulsive
contortions, and when once I lay down on the trail that I might view the
scene through the lowest stratum of the agitated air, every peak shot up
suddenly far into the sky like the outspreading of one's fingers, to
subside as suddenly as I rose to my feet again. The psalmist's query
came naturally to the mind, "Why hop ye so ye hills?" and our Kobuk boy
Roxy, whose enjoyment of fine landscapes and strange sights was always
a pleasure to witness, answered the unspoken question. "God make
mountains dance because spring come," he said prettily enough.

Then we crossed another portage and cut off ten miles of river by it,
and when we reached the river again I wanted to stop, for it grew
towards evening and here was good camping-ground. But we had lately met
some travelling Kobuks and they had told Roxy of a cabin "just little
way" farther on, and I yielded to the rest of the company, who would
push on to it and thus avoid the necessity of making camp. That native
"just little way" is worse than the Scotch "mile and a bittock"; indeed,
the natives have poor notion of distance in general, and miles have as
vague meaning to them as kilometres have to the average Anglo-Saxon.

[Sidenote: A BELATED CAMP]

On and on we pushed, mile after mile, and still no cabin. In the
gathering dusk we would continually think we saw it; half-fallen trees
or sloping branches simulating snow-covered gables. At last it grew
quite dark, and when there was general agreement that we must seek the
cabin no longer, but camp, there was no place to camp in. Either the
bank was inaccessible or there was lack of dry timber. We went on thus,
seeking rest and finding none, until seven-thirty, and then made camp by
candle-light, in a poor place at that, having trudged thirty-five miles
that day. A night-made camp is always an uncomfortable camp, and an
uncomfortable camp means a miserable night, which to-morrow must pay
for. We did not get to bed till nearly midnight, and it was
nine-forty-five when we started out next morning, and we made only
fifteen miles that day.

The Kobuk valley continued to open out wider and wider and the mountains
right and left to recede. The Jade Mountains were now dim and distant
behind us, and new ranges were coming into view. The people on this
lower river are very few. It was just about one hundred miles from Long
Beach when we reached the next native village, a miserable collection of
pole dwellings, half underground, with perhaps a score of inhabitants.
Certainly the conditions of life deteriorated as we descended this
river. The country seems to afford nothing but fish; we were amongst the
ichthyophagi pure and simple. Roxy, bred and born on the upper Kobuk and
never so far down before, is very scornful about it. "Me no likee this
country," he says; "no caribou, no ptarmigan, no rabbits, no timber, no
nothin'." The weather had grown raw and cold again, with a constant
disagreeable wind that took all the fun out of travelling. We passed a
place where a white man was pessimistically picking away at a vein of
coal in the river bluff. "Yes, we been here all winter," he said,
"working on the blamed ledge. I always knowed it was goin' to pinch out,
and now it's begun to pinch. My partner's gone to Candle for more grub,
but I told him it weren't no use. It's pinchin' out right now. I knowed
it afore we started work, but the blamed fool wouldn't listen to me.
'It'll pinch out,' I told him a dozen times; 'you mark my word it'll
pinch out,' I told him, and now it's begun to pinch; and I hope he'll be
satisfied." We were reminded of the many coal-mines from time to time
located on the Yukon, in all or nearly all of which the vein has
"pinched out." The deposits on the coast may be all the fancy of the
magazine writer paints, and may hold the "incalculable wealth" that is
attributed to them, but the coal on the interior rivers seems in scant
measure and of inferior quality.

The same night we reached the native village at the mouth of the
Squirrel River, another northern tributary--the Kobuk receives most of
its waters from the north--and we spent the night and the next day,
which was Sunday, in one of the half-underground huts of the place, in
company with twelve other people. Here we found Roxy's brother, dubbed
"Napoleon" by some white man. They had not seen one another for years,
yet all the greeting was a mutual grunt. The Kobuks are not
demonstrative in their affections, but it would not be right to conclude
the affection lacking. I have seen an old Esquimau woman taking part in
a dance the night after her husband was buried, yet it would have been
unjust to have concluded that she was callous and indifferent. It is
very easy to misunderstand a strange people, and very hard to understand
them thoroughly.

[Sidenote: THE CANINE INTRUDER]

The roof of the tent was dome-shaped and it was lit by a seal-gut
skylight. In the morning while I was conducting Divine service and
attempting most lamely by the mouth of a poor interpreter to convey some
instruction, a dog fight outside adjourned to the roof and presently
both combatants came tumbling through the gut window into the midst of
the congregation. They were unceremoniously picked up and flung out of
the door, a few stitches with a needleful of sinew repaired the window,
and the proceedings were resumed. These gut windows have their
convenience as well as their inconvenience. When the hut gets too warm
and close even for Esquimaux, the seal gut is folded back and the outer
air rushes in to the great refreshment of the occupants; when the hut is
cool enough the gut is replaced. A skylight is far and away the best
method of illuminating any single-story structure, and this membrane is
remarkably translucent, while the snow that falls or frost that forms
upon such a skylight is quickly removed by beating the hand upon the
drum-like surface. All glass windows must be double glazed, or else in
the very cold weather they are quickly covered with a thick deposit of
frost from the condensation of the moisture inside the room, and then
they admit much less light than gut does. One of its unpleasant features
is the way the membrane snaps back and forth with a report like a pistol
whenever the door is opened and shut, but on the whole it is a very good
substitute for glass indeed.

[Sidenote: SLEEPING CUSTOMS]

These river Esquimaux vary greatly in physical appearance. While many of
them are somewhat undersized and all have small feet and hands, some are
well-developed specimens of manhood. "Riley Jim," the chief of this
tribe, would be counted a tall, stalwart man anywhere. And while many
have coarse, squat features, here and there is one who is decidedly
attractive in appearance. A sweet smile which is often upon the face,
and small, regular white teeth, greatly help to redeem any countenance.
A youth of about eighteen at the Squirrel River would properly be called
handsome, one thinks--though amongst native people one grows a little
afraid of forgetting standards of comparison; and his wife--for he was
already a husband--was a decidedly pretty girl. A word ought to be said
which applies to all the Esquimaux we met. Although many people live in
one hut and there is no possible privacy, yet we saw no immodesty of any
sort. They sleep entirely nude--probably our own great-grandparents did
the same, at least the people of Defoe and Smollet did, for nightshirts
and pyjamas are very modern things. There is much to be said from an
hygienic point of view in favour of that custom as against turning in
"all standing" as the Indian generally does, or sleeping in the day
underwear as most white men do. But although every one of a dozen people
in cabin after cabin that we stayed at on the Kobuk River above and
below this place, of both sexes and all ages, would thus strip
completely and go to bed, there was never any exposure of the body at
all. It may be, of course, that our presence imposed a greater care in
this respect, but it did not so impress us; it seemed the normal thing.
Another noticeable feature of the lives of all these people was their
devoutness in the matter of thanks before and after meat. Some of them
would not so much as give and receive a drink of cold water without a
long responsive grace.

As we went on down the river the country grew bleaker and drearier and
the few scattered inhabitants were living more and more the life of the
seacoast. The dwellings resembled igloos more than cabins, being
completely covered with snow and approached by underground passages,
with heavy flaps of untanned sealskin to close them. When we passed a
fork of the river we knew that we were entering the delta of the Kobuk,
and that another day would take us to the mission on Kotzebue Sound. It
was a long, hard day, in which we made forty miles, but an interesting
one. With a start at six, we were at the mouth by nine-thirty. The
spruce which had for some time been dwarfing and dwindling gave place to
willows, the willows shrank to shrubs, the shrubs changed to coarse
grass thrusting yellow tassels through the snow. The river banks sank
and flattened out and ceased, and we were on Hotham Inlet with the long
coast-line of the peninsula that forms it stretching away north and
south in the distance. Roxy's bewilderment was amusing. He stopped and
gazed about him and said: "Kobuk River all pechuk!" ("Pechuk" means
"played out.") "What's the matter, no more Kobuk River?" I think his
mind had never really entertained the notion of the river ending, though
of course he must often have heard of its mouth in the salt water. He
was out of his country, his bearings all gone, a feeling of helpless
insecurity taking the place of his usual confidence, and I think he said
no more all that day.

We had to traverse the ice of Hotham Inlet northward to its mouth,
double the end of the peninsula, and then travel south along the coast
to the mission at Kikitaruk, the peninsula being too rugged to cross.
Three considerable rivers drain into Hotham Inlet, roughly parallel in
their east and west courses, the Noatak, the Kobuk, and the Selawik, so
that its waters must be commonly more fresh than salt, for its bounds
are narrow and the extensive delta of its eastern shore would argue its
depth slight. Ahead of us, as we travelled north making a bee-line for
the end of the peninsula, all the afternoon, loomed the rocky promontory
of Krusenstern, one of Kotzebue's capes, and far beyond, stretching up
the dim coast-line, lay the way to Point Hope. It was with a sinking of
the heart that I gazed upon it, for I knew already, though I had not
announced a decision, that the road to Point Hope could not be my road
that year. All day long the thermometer stood between -40° and -30°, and
the constant light sea-breeze kept scarfs wrapped closely about mouths
and noses, which always means disagreeable travel. When the company
stopped at noon to eat a little frozen lunch, I was too chilly to cease
my movement and pressed on. The day of that blessed comfort of the
trail, the thermos flask, was not yet. By two-thirty we had reached Pipe
Spit, which still further contracts the narrow entrance of the inlet,
and turning west for a mile or two rounded the point and then turned
south for ten miles along the coast. Just about dark we reached the
mission and stood gazing out over the rough ice of Kotzebue Sound to the
Arctic Ocean, having made the forty miles in ten and a half hours. We
had come about one thousand miles from Fairbanks, all of it on foot and
most of it on snow-shoes.

[Sidenote: THE ARCTIC OCEAN]

So here was my first sight of the Arctic Ocean. All day long I had
anticipated it, and it stirred me,--a dim, grey expanse stretching vast
and vague in the dusk of the evening. The old navigators whose stories I
had read as a boy passed before me in their wonderful, bold sailing
vessels, going in and out uncharted waters that steamships will not
venture to-day--Kotzebue, Beechey, Collinson, McClure--pushing
resolutely northward.

Less happy had been my first sight of the Pacific Ocean, five years
before. I had the ill luck to come upon it by way of that Western Coney
Island, Santa Monica, and from the merry-go-rounds and cheap eating
places Balboa and Magellan and Franky Drake fled away incontinent and
would not be conjured back; though, indeed, the original discoverers
would have had yet further occasion to gaze at one another "with a wild
surmise" if they had seen shrieking companies "shooting the chutes." But
here was vastness, here was desolation, here was silence; jagged ice
masses in the foreground and boundless expanse beyond, solemn and
mysterious. The Arctic Ocean was even as I had pictured it.

The missionary in charge at Kikitaruk had been informed by letter of our
projected journey during the previous summer and had long expected us.
We were received with kindness and hospitality, and after supper began
at once our acquaintance with his work, for there was a service that
night which it was thought we should attend. I spoke for a few minutes
through an excellent interpreter and then spent a couple of hours
nodding over the stove, overcome with sleep, while there was much
singing and "testimony."

[Sidenote: TOTAL-ABSTINENCE ESQUIMAUX]

The Californian Society of Friends, established here a number of years
with branches at other points on Kotzebue Sound, has done an excellent
work amongst the Esquimaux. If they had accomplished nothing else it
would stand to the everlasting credit of the Society's missionaries that
they have succeeded in imbuing the natives under their charge with a
total aversion to all intoxicating liquor. We had come down from the
remotest points to which the influence of these people has extended; we
had met their natives five hundred miles away from their base of
instruction, and everywhere we found the same thing. It was said by the
white men on the Koyukuk that a Kobuk could not be induced to take a
drink of whisky. It seemed to us a pity that the force of this most
wholesome doctrine should be weakened by the unsuccessful attempt to
include tobacco in the same rigorous prohibition. In several cabins
where we stayed there was no sign of smoking until members of our party
produced pipes, whereupon other pipes were furtively produced and the
tobacco that was offered was eagerly accepted. From any rational point
of view the putting of whisky and tobacco in the same category is surely
a folly. There can be few more harmless indulgences to the native than
his pipe, and no one knows the solace of the pipe until he has smoked it
around the camp-fire in the arctic regions after a hard day's journey.

The decision to turn my back on Point Hope was, I think, the most
painful decision I ever made in my life; with all my heart I wanted to
go on. It was only one hundred and sixty or one hundred and seventy
miles away. The journey had been made in three or four days; but we
were now come to a country where travel is impossible in bad weather and
where bad weather prevails; and that journey might quite as likely take
two weeks. I worked over the calendar in my diary, figuring how many
days of travel still remained, allowing reasonable margins, and I could
not see that I had much more than time to get back to Fairbanks before
the break-up, which for sufficient reason I regarded as my first duty.
The day of rest at Kikitaruk was Washington's birthday, the 22d of
February. Eight weeks would bring us to the 19th April, by which time
the trails would be already breaking up. Counting out Sundays, that left
forty-eight days of travelling with something like twelve hundred miles
yet to make without going to Point Hope--an average of about twenty-five
miles a day. I knew that we had made no such average in the distance
already covered, and though I knew also that travelling improved
generally as the season advanced, I did not know how very much better
going there is on the wind-hardened snows of the coast when travelling
is possible at all. Again and again I have regretted that I did not take
the chance and push on, but at the time I decided as I thought I ought
to decide, and one has no real compunctions when that is the case.

[Sidenote: THE RESOLUTION TO TURN SOUTH]

So a first-hand knowledge of our own most interesting work among the
Esquimaux was not for me on that occasion--and there has arisen no
opportunity since. Mr. Knapp, who had planned to spend the rest of the
winter at Point Hope, would get a guide and a team here and turn north
after some days' rest, while I would turn south. Roxy was impatient to
return to Bettles. "Me no likee this country," was all that could be got
out of him. So I paid him his money and made him a present of the .22
repeating rifle with which he had killed so many ptarmigan on the
journey, outfitted him with clothes, grub, and ammunition, and let him
go; saying good-bye with regret, for he was a good boy to us all the
way.

It was late on the night of our single day of rest when I got to bed,
for there had been squaring up of accounts and much writing, and when I
went to bed I did not sleep. Again and again I reviewed the decision I
had come to and fought against it, though such is far from my common
habit. Even as I write, years after, the bitter rebellious reluctance
with which I turned south comes back to me. I wished the hospital at
Fairbanks at the bottom of the deep blue sea. I protested I would go on
and complete my journey, even though it involved "thawing out" at Tanana
and getting to Fairbanks on a steamboat in the summer. I had a free
hand, a kindly and complaisant bishop, and none would call me strictly
to account. Then I realised that it was merely pride of purpose,
self-willed resolution of accomplishing what had been essayed--in a
word, personal gratification for which I was fighting, and with that
realisation came surrender and sleep.




CHAPTER IV

THE SEWARD PENINSULA--CANDLE CREEK, COUNCIL, AND NOME


ONE day's rest was not a great deal after the distance we had come--and
that day fully occupied with business--but since Point Hope was
abandoned some sort of schedule must be made for the Seward Peninsula,
and where Sunday shall be spent is always an important factor in
arranging these itineraries. There was just time to reach Candle for the
next Sunday and it was decided to attempt it. Hans would accompany me as
far as Candle, where he hoped to find work. It meant two days of
forty-five miles each, for it is ninety miles from Kikitaruk to Candle,
but they told us it could be done.

So the reluctant adieus made, letters despatched, some mailed here at
Kikitaruk, some to be carried back to Bettles and mailed there--these
latter getting outside long before the former--we started at seven in
the morning instead of six, as we had planned, on the journey down the
shore of Kotzebue Sound. That hour's delay turned out to be a calamity
for us.

The trail was smooth along the beach until Cape Blossom was reached, and
I had the first riding of the winter, Hans and I alternately running and
jumping on the sled. There was a portage across the cape, and three or
four miles below it was the wreck of the river steamer _Riley_, which
used to make a voyage up the Kobuk with supplies for the miners at the
Shungnak. The thermometer was at -38° when we started, and the same
light but keen breeze was blowing that had annoyed us on the other side
of the peninsula. What a barren, desolate region it is!--low rocks
sinking away to the dead level of the snow-field on the one hand,
nothing but the ice-field on the other.

[Sidenote: A BAD NIGHT]

[Sidenote: CAMPED IN THE OPEN]

We were bound for an igloo forty-five miles from the mission, the only
shelter between Kikitaruk on the peninsula and Kewalik on the mainland,
and we had been warned that the igloo would be easy to miss if it grew
dark as it would be almost indistinguishable from the snow-drifts of the
shore. Some directions from a multitude of counsellors remembered in one
sense by Hans and in another by me, added to our uncertainty as to just
where the igloo lay. The wind increased in force as the evening advanced
and the last time I looked at the thermometer it still registered -38°.
The sun set over the sound with another of those curious distortions
which had before proved ominous to us. It was flattened and swollen out
like a pot-bellied Chinese lantern, with a neck to it and an irregular
veining over its surface that completed the resemblance. The wind
increased until the air was full of flying snow and it grew dark, and
still there was no sign of the igloo. Only slowly and with much
difficulty could the trail be followed, and that meant we were soon not
moving fast enough to keep warm in the fierce wind. At last we lost the
trail altogether, and sometimes we found ourselves out on the rough ice
of the sound and sometimes wallowing in a fresh snow-drift on the shore.
I became possessed with the fear that we had passed the igloo. I was
positive that we were told at the mission that we should reach it
_before_ the high bluffs were passed, and we had passed them a long way
and had now but a shallow shelf to mark the coast-line. It is strange
how long that delusion about passing his destination will pursue the
Alaskan traveller. Presently the dogs dropped off a steep bank in the
dark, and only by good fortune we were able to keep the heavy sled from
falling upon them, for they were dead tired and lay where they dropped.
With freezing fingers I unhitched the dogs while Hans held the sled, and
we lowered it safely down. But it was plain that it was dangerous to
proceed. We could not find the trail again and were growing alarmingly
cold. We were "up against it," as they say here, "up against it good and
strong." We had a tent but no means of putting it up, a stove but
nothing to burn in it, a grub box full of food but no way to cook it. So
the first night of coast travel was to show us the full rigour and
inhospitality of the coast and to make us long for the interior again.
Wood can almost always be found there within a few miles, if it be not
immediately at hand, and no one properly appreciates the hospitality of
a clump of spruce-trees until he has spent a night of storm lying out on
this barren coast. We turned the dogs loose and threw them a fish
apiece, unlashed the sled, and got out our bedding. I had been sleeping
in robes, Hans in a shedding caribou-hide sleeping-bag that was my pet
aversion. When he crawled out in the morning he was so covered with hair
that he looked like a caribou, and the miserable hairs were always
getting into the food. We fished them out of the coffee, pulled them out
of the butter, and picked them out of the bread. But now in that
sleeping-bag he had an enormous advantage. We lay side by side on the
snow in the lee of the sled, and, tuck myself up with blanket and robe
as I would, it was impossible to keep the swirling snow from coming in.
I called the dogs to me and made them lie on my feet and up against my
side, and so long as they lay still I could get a little warmth, but
whenever they rose and left me I grew numb again. But Hans in his
sleeping-bag was snoring. The bag is the only bedding on the coast.
Added to the physical discomfort of that sleepless, shivery night was
some mental uneasiness. There was no telling to what height the storm
might rise, nor how long it might continue. Sometimes travellers
overtaken in this way on the coast have to lie in their sleeping-bags
for three days and nights before they can resume their journey. The only
interest the night held was the thought that came to me that as nearly
as I could tell we camped exactly on the Arctic Circle. The long night
dragged its slow length to the dawn at last and the wind moderated a
little at the same time, so with the first streak in the east I awoke
Hans, we gathered our poor dogs together, rolled up the snow-incrusted
bedding, and resumed our journey. Two miles farther on was the igloo!
Our calls awoke some one and we were bidden to enter. Descending a
ladder and crawling through a dark passage we came in to the grateful
warmth and shelter. The chamber was crowded with sleeping Esquimaux and
reeked with seal oil and fish, but Hans said it "looked good and smelled
good to him," and so it did to me also. One has to lie out on that coast
in a storm to appreciate the value of mere shelter. We went at once to
cooking, for we had eaten nothing but a doughnut or two in twenty-four
hours, and surely never meal was more relished than the reindeer steaks
and the coffee we took amongst those still sleeping Esquimaux. I should
have liked to spend the day and the next night there, for they were
friendly and kindly, but the wind had moderated somewhat and there was
still a chance to reach Candle for Sunday. With the offer of a sack of
flour at Kewalik we induced a couple of Esquimaux to accompany us, for I
knew we had to cross the mouth of a bay over the ice to reach the
mainland and I wanted to take no more chances.

Our company, again raised to four, started out about nine, and until the
Choris Peninsula was reached the trail still skirted the shore. It is
strange that Kotzebue, who named this peninsula of a peninsula for the
artist who accompanied his expedition in 1816, should have left the main
peninsula itself unnamed, and that the British expedition which named
Cape Blossom ten years later should have failed to supply the omission.
It still bears no name on the map. We portaged across the Choris
Peninsula and at the end of the portage took a straight course across
the mouth of Escholtz Bay (Escholtz was Kotzebue's surgeon) for Kewalik
on the mainland, passing Chamisso Island, named for Kotzebue's poet
friend. There is something very interesting to me in this voyage of
Kotzebue's, and I have long wished to come across a full narrative of
it. But the bitter wind that swept across that ice-sheet with the
thermometer at -30° brought one's thoughts back to one's own condition.
My hands I could not keep warm with the gear that had sufficed for 50°
and 60° below in the interior, and I was very glad to procure from one
of our native companions a pair of caribou mitts with the hair inside,
an almost invulnerable gauntlet against cold. If that wind had been in
our faces instead of on our sides I am sure we could not have travelled
at all. At last we won across the ice and brought up at a comfortable
road-house at Kewalik, about ten miles from Candle. Here we lay
overnight, taking the opportunity of thawing out and drying the
frost-crusted bedding, leaving the short run into town for the morning.

[Sidenote: CANDLE CREEK]

The diggings on Candle Creek yield to the Koyukuk diggings only as the
most northerly gold mining in the world. Although the general methods
are the same in all Alaskan camps, local circumstances introduce many
differences. In all Alaskan camps the ground is frozen and must be
thawed down. The timber of the interior renders wood the natural fuel
for the production of the steam that thaws the ground, but the scarcity
of wood on the Seward Peninsula substitutes coal. There is coal on the
peninsula itself, but of very inferior quality, mixed with ice. One may
see chunks of coal with veins of ice running through them thrown upon
the fire. The wood of the interior is a great factor in its commercial
and domestic economy, and its absence on the Seward Peninsula makes
great change not only in the natural aspect of the country but in the
whole aspect of its industrial and domestic life also. Wood-chopping for
the stove and the mill, wood-sawing, wood-hauling employ no small
percentage of all the white men in the interior--occupations which do
not exist at all on the peninsula. But its encompassment by the sea, its
peninsularity, is the dominating difference between the Seward Peninsula
and the interior, and does indeed make a different country of it
altogether. All prices are very much lower on the peninsula because
ships can bring merchandise directly from the "outside." Thus amongst
those who have money to spend there is a more lavish scale of living
than in the interior towns, and luxuries may be enjoyed here that are
out of the question there. Perhaps, conversely, it is true that life on
the peninsula is somewhat harder for the poorer class. Whether a railway
from salt water to the mid-Yukon would redress this great difference in
the cost of everything may be doubted. Railways do not usually operate
at less than water-rates. There will probably always be an advantage in
the cost of living and mining in favour of the Seward Peninsula camps.

There had been no public religious service of any sort in Candle, with
its several hundreds of population, in three years, so there was special
satisfaction in having reached the place for Sunday when many miners
were in town from the creeks, and an overflowing congregation was
readily assembled. And there was great pleasure in three days' rest at
the hospitable home of a friend while the temperature remained below
-40°, exacerbated by a wind that rendered travelling dangerous.
Moreover, by waiting I had company on the way, and now that I was
without native attendant or white companion, and disposed, if possible,
to make the journey right across the peninsula to Council and then to
Nome without engaging fresh assistance, I was doubly glad of the
opportunity of travelling with two men bound for the same places and
acquainted with the route.

[Sidenote: THE SEWARD PENINSULA]

Travelling, like so many other things, is very different on the Seward
Peninsula. The constant winds beat down and harden the snow until it has
a crust that will carry a man anywhere. There are only two means by
which snow becomes crusted; one is this packing and solidifying by the
wind, and the other is thawing and freezing again. There is much less
wind in the interior than on the coast, and usually much less snowfall,
and the greater part of the surface of the country is protected by
trees; the climate, being continental instead of marine, is not subject
to such great fluctuations of temperature. A thaw sufficiently
pronounced or sufficiently prolonged to put a stout crust on the snow
when freezing is resumed, is a very rare thing in the interior and a
common thing on the coast. So a striking difference in travel at once
manifests itself; in the interior all the snow is soft except on a
beaten trail itself, while in the Seward Peninsula all the snow is alike
hard. The musher is not confined to trails--he can go where he pleases;
and his vehicle is under no necessity of conforming in width to a
general usage of the country--it may be as wide as he pleases. Hence the
hitching of dogs two and three abreast; hence the sleds of twenty-two,
twenty-four, or twenty-six inches in width. My tandem rig aroused the
curiosity of those who saw it. Hence many other differences also.
Hitherto we had not dreamed of watering the dogs since snow fell; now I
found their mouths bloody from their ineffectual attempts to dig up the
hard snow with their teeth, and had to water them night and morning. It
is not the custom on the Seward Peninsula to cook for the dogs, and dog
mushers there argue the needlessness of that trouble. But the true
reason is other and obvious. It is difficult for the traveller to get
enough wood to cook for himself, let alone the dogs. On the Seward
Peninsula skis are extensively used when there is soft snow; the
prevalence of brush almost everywhere in the interior renders them of
little use--and they are, therefore, little used, snow-shoes being
universal.

So, as in nearly all such matters everywhere, local peculiarities, local
differences, local customs, usually arise from local conditions, and the
wise man will commonly conform so soon as he discovers them. There is
almost always a sufficient reason for them.

[Sidenote: A "SIDLING" TRAIL]

The journey from Candle to Council was a surprisingly swift one. We
covered the one hundred and thirty miles in three days, far and away the
best travelling of the winter so far, but the usual time, I found. The
hard snow gives smooth passage though the interior of the peninsula is
rugged and mountainous; two prominent elevations, the Ass's Ears,
standing up as landmarks during the first day of the journey. The route
crossed ridge after ridge with steep grades, and the handling of the
heavy sled alone was too much for me. Again and again it was overturned,
and it was all that I could do, and more than I ought to have done, to
set it up again. The wind continued to blow with violence, and shelter
from it there was none. One hillside struggle I shall always remember.
The trail sloped with the hill and the wind was blowing directly down
it. I could keep no footing on the marble snow and had fallen heavily
again and again, in my frantic efforts to hold sled and dogs and all
from sweeping down into a dark ravine that loomed below, when I
bethought me of the "creepers" in the hind-sack, used on the rivers in
passing over glare ice. With these irons strapped to my feet I was able
to stand upright, but it was only by a hair's breadth once and again
that I got my load safely across. When I was wallowing in a hot bath at
Council two days later I found that my hip and thigh were black and blue
where I had fallen, though at the time, in my anxiety to save the dogs
and the sled, I had not noticed that I had bruised myself. So, judging
great things by little, one understands how a soldier may be sorely
wounded without knowing it in the heat and exaltation of battle.

Then for a while there would be such travel as one sees in the
children's picture-books, where the man sits in the sled and cracks his
whip and is whisked along as gaily as you please--such travel as I had
never had before; but there was no pleasure in it--the wind saw to
that.

On the second day we crossed "Death Valley," so called because two men
were once found frozen in it; a bleak, barren expanse, five or six miles
across, with a great gale blowing right down it, charged not only with
particles of hard snow but with spicules of ice and grains of sand. Our
course was south and the gale blew from the northwest, and the right
side of one's body and the right arm were continually numb from the
incessant beating of the wind. The parkee hood had to be drawn closely
all the time, and the eyes were sore from trying to peer ahead through
the fur edging of the hood. One grows to hate that wind with something
like a personal animosity, so brutal, so malicious does it seem. An
incautious turn of the head and the scarf that protected mouth and nose
was snatched from me and borne far away in an instant, beyond thought of
recovery. It seems to lie in wait, and one fancies a fresh shrill of
glee in its note at every new discomfiture it can inflict. There is
nothing far-fetched in the native superstition that puts a malignant
spirit in the wind; it is the most natural feeling in the world. I said
so that night in camp, and one of my companions mentioned something
about "rude Boreas," and I laughed. The gentle myths of Greece do not
fit this country. The Indian name means "the wind beast," and is
appropriate.

A savage, forbidding country, this whole interior of the Seward
Peninsula, uninhabited and unfit for habitation; a country of naked rock
and bare hillside and desolate, barren valley, without amenities of any
kind and cursed with a perpetual icy blast.

[Sidenote: DEATH VALLEY]

The valley crossed and its ridge surmounted, a still more heart-breaking
experience was in store. We descended the frozen bed of a creek from
which the wind had swept every trace of snow so that the ice was
polished as smooth as glass. The dogs could get no footing and were
continually down on their bellies, moving their legs instinctively but
helplessly, like the flippers of a turtle, while the wind carried dogs
and sled where it pleased. The grade was considerable and in bends the
creek spread out wide. Nothing but the creepers enabled a man to stand
at all, and creepers and brake together could not hold the sled from
careering sideways across the ice, dragging the dogs with it, until the
runners struck some pebble or twig frozen in the ice and the sled would
be violently overturned. Twice with freezing fingers I unlashed that
sled lying on its side, and took out nearly all the load before I could
succeed in getting it upright again, losing some of the lighter articles
each time. The third time was the worst of all. The brake had been
little more than a pivot on which sled and dogs were swung to leeward,
but now the teeth had become so blunt that, though I stood upon it with
all my weight, it would not hold at all nor check the sideways motion
under the impulse of the wind. Right across the creek we went, dragging
the dogs behind, jerking them hither and thither over the glassy
surface. I saw the rocks towards which we were driving, but was
powerless to avert the disaster, and hung on in some hope, I suppose, of
being able to minimise it, till, with a crash that broke two of the
uprights and threw me so hard that I skinned my elbow and hurt my head,
we were once more overturned. Never since I reached manhood, I think,
did I feel so much like sitting down and crying. It seemed hopeless to
think about getting down that creek until the wind stopped, and one
doubts if the wind ever does stop in that country. But there was no good
sitting there like a shipwrecked mariner, nursing sores and misfortunes;
presently one would begin to feel sorry for oneself--that last resort of
incompetence. And the bitter wind is a great stimulus. It will not
permit inaction. So I was up again, fumbling at the sled lashings as
best I could with torpid fingers, when one of my companions, uneasy at
my delay, very kindly made his way back, and with his assistance I was
able to get the sled upright again without unloading and hold it
somewhat better on its course until another bend or two brought us to
the partial shelter of bluffs and, a little farther, to the cabin where
we were to spend the night. I understood now why my companions had a
sort of hinged knife-edge fastened to one runner of their sled. By the
pressure of a foot the knife-edge engaged the ice and held the sled on
its course. This is another Seward Peninsula device.

[Sidenote: THE KINDLY SWEDE]

I have it in my diary that "a Swede named Petersen was very kind to us
at the cabin, cooking for us and giving us cooked dog feed." Blessed
Swede named Petersen!--there are hundreds of them in Alaska--and I shall
never forget that particular one's kindness--the only man I met in the
Seward Peninsula who still persisted in cooking dog feed whenever he
could. He had cooked up a mess of rice and fish enough to last his three
or four dogs several days while he sojourned at this cabin, and he gave
it all to us and would take nothing for it. His language was what
Truthful James calls "frequent and painful and free." I ignored it for a
while, loath to take exception to anything a man said who had been so
kind. But at last I could stand it no longer--it took all the savour out
of his hospitality--and I said: "I hope you won't mind my saying it, for
I'd hate to give offence to a man who has been so good to strangers as
you have, but I wish you'd cut out that cursing; it hurts my ears." He
sat silent a moment looking straight at me, and I was not sure how he
had taken it. Then he said: "Maybe you been kinder to me saying that,
than I been to you. That's the first time I ever been call down for
cursin'. I don't mean nothin' by it; it's just foolishness and I goin'
try to cut it out."

The dogs had done but ill on the dry fish, accustomed as they were to
cooked food, and they ate ravenously of their supper. Only the previous
night Lingo had betrayed his trust for the first and last time. Coming
out of the cabin just before turning in, to take a last look round, I
saw Lingo on top of the sled eating something, and I found that he had
dug a slab of bacon out of the unlashed load and had eaten most of it. I
knew he was hungry, missing the filling, satisfying mess he was used to,
and I did not thrash him, I simply said, "Oh, Lingo!" and the dog got
off the sled and slunk away, the very picture of conscious, shamefaced
guilt. That was the only time he did such a thing in all the six years I
drove him.

Council was past its prime at the time of this visit, but just as we
entered the town, at the end of the third day's run, it seemed in danger
of going through all the stages of decadence with a rush to total
destruction out of hand, for a fire had broken out in a laundry, and
with the high wind still blowing it looked as though every building was
doomed. Of two chemical engines possessed by the town one refused to
work, but the vigour and promptness of the people in forming two lines
down to the river, and passing buckets with the utmost rapidity, coped
with the outbreak just in time to prevent its spreading beyond all
control. Tired as we were, we all pitched in and passed buckets until
parkees and mitts and mukluks were incrusted with ice from water that
was spilled. Efficient protection is a matter of great difficulty and
expense in Alaskan towns, and there is not one of them that has escaped
being swept by fire. The buildings are almost necessarily all of wood,
the cost of brick and stone construction being prohibitive. No one can
guarantee ten years of life to a placer-mining town, and there would be
no warrant for the expenditure of the sums required for fireproof
building even were the capital available. But the rapidity with which
they are rebuilt, where rebuilding is justified, is even more remarkable
than the rapidity with which they are destroyed.

A Saturday and Sunday were very welcome at Council, and the courtesy of
the Presbyterian minister, who gave up his church and his congregations
to me, Esquimaux in the morning and white at night, was much
appreciated.

[Sidenote: NORTON SOUND]

In warmer weather, the thermometer no lower than -5° at the start, but
with the same gale blowing that had blown ever since we left Candle,
though it had shifted towards the northeast, we got away on Monday
morning, bound for Nome, ninety miles away, hoping to reach the half-way
house that night. Five or six hours' run over good trails, with no
greater inconvenience than the acceleration of our pace by the wind on
down grades, until the sled frequently overran the dogs with
entanglements and spillings, brought us to the seacoast at Topkok, and a
noble view opened up as we climbed the great bluff. There Norton Sound
spread out before us, its ice largely cleared away and blown into Bering
Sea by the strong wind that had prevailed for nearly a week, its waves
sparkling and dashing into foam in the March sunshine; the distant
cliffs and mountains of its other shore just visible in the clear air.
It was an exhilarating sight--the first free water that I had seen since
the summer, and it seemed rejoicing in its freedom, leaping up with glee
to greet the mighty ally that had struck off its fetters.

But from this point troubles began to grow. We dropped down presently to
the shore and passed along the glare surface of lagoon after lagoon, the
wind doing what it liked with the sled, for it was impossible to handle
it at all. Sometimes we went along broadside on, sometimes the sled
first and the dogs trailing behind, moving their silly, helpless paws
from side to side as they were dragged over the ice on their bellies.
When we had passed these lagoons the trail took the beach, running
alongside and just to windward of a telephone-line, with rough shore
ice to the left and bare rocks to the right. Again and again the already
injured sled was smashed heavily against a telephone pole. I would see
the impact coming and strive my utmost to avert it, but without a gee
pole, and swinging the sled only by the handle-bars, it was more than I
could do to hold the sled on its course against the beam wind that was
forcing it towards the ice and the telephone poles; and a gee pole could
not be used at the rate we had travelled ever since we left Candle. Mile
after mile we went along in this way. I do not know how many poles I hit
and how many I missed, but every pole on that stretch of coast was a
fresh and separate anxiety and menace to me. I think I would have been
perfectly willing to have abolished and wiped out the whole invention of
the telephone so I could be rid of those hateful poles. What were
telephone poles doing in the arctic regions anyway? Telephone poles
belonged with electric cars and interurban trolley-lines, not with dog
teams and sleds.

Then it grew dark and the wind increased. I did not know it, but I was
approaching that stretch of coast which is notorious as the windiest
place in all Alaska, a place the topography of which makes it a natural
funnel for the outlet of wind should any be blowing anywhere in the
interior of the peninsula. My companions were far ahead, long since out
of sight. I struggled along a little farther, and, just after a
particularly bad collision and an overturning, I saw a light glimmering
in the snow to my right. It was a little road-house, buried to the eaves
and over the roof in snow-drift, with window tunnels and a door tunnel
excavated in the snow. I was yet, I learned, five miles from Solomon's,
my destination, but I hailed this haven as my refuge for the night and
went no farther, more exhausted by the struggle of the last two or three
hours than by many an all-day tramp on snow-shoes. It was a miserable,
dirty little shack, but it was tight; it meant shelter from that
pitiless wind. That night the thermometer stood at 7°, the first plus
temperature in twenty-two days.

By morning the gale had greatly diminished, and by the time I reached
Solomon's and rejoined my companions it was calm, the first calm since
we left the middle Kobuk. We had some rough ice to cross to avoid a long
detour of the coast, and then we were back on the shore again and it
began to snow. The snow was soon done and the sun shone, but the new
coating of dazzling white gave such a glare that it was necessary to put
on the snow glasses for the first time of the winter--and that is always
a sign winter draws to a close.

[Sidenote: DOGS AND REINDEER]

On the approach to Nome we had our first encounter with reindeer, and at
once my dog team became unmanageable. I had had some trouble that
morning with a horse. A new dog I procured at Kikitaruk had never seen a
horse before, and made frantic efforts to get at him, leaping at his
haunches as we passed by. But when they saw the reindeer the whole team
set off at a run, dragging the heavy sled as if it were nothing. The
Esquimau driving the deer saw the approaching dogs and hastily drew his
equipage off the trail farther inshore, standing between the deer and
the dogs with a heavy whip. What the result would have been had the
dogs reached the deer it is hard to say. I had kept my stand on the step
behind the sled and managed to check its wild career with the brake and
to throw it over and stop the approach before the carnivora reached
their immemorial prey. Herein lies one of the difficulties of the
domestication of reindeer in Alaska, a country where so far dogs have
been the only domestic animals. Again, as we entered the outskirts of
Nome the incident was repeated, and only the hasty driving of the
reindeer into a barn prevented the dogs from seizing the deer that time.

[Sidenote: NOME]

Jimmy was long deposed from his ineffectual leadership and a little dog
named Kewalik--the one I obtained at Kikitaruk--was at the head of the
team. Kewalik had never seen so many houses before; hitherto almost
every cabin he had reached on his journeys had been a resting-place, and
he wanted to dive into every house we passed. At Candle and Council
both, our stopping-place had been near the entrance to the little town.
But now we had to pass up one long street after another and I had
continually to drag him and the team he led first from a yard on this
side of the road and then from one on the other. The dog was perfectly
bewildered and out of his head by the number of people and the number of
houses he saw. We were indeed a sorry, travel-worn, unkempt, uncivilised
band, man and dogs, with an old, battered vehicle, and we felt our
incongruity with the new environment as we entered the metropolis of the
luxury and wealth of the North. Here we passed a jeweller's shop, the
whole window aglow with the dull gleam of gold and ivory--the terrible
nugget jewellery so much affected in these parts and the walrus ivory
which is Alaska's other contribution of material for the ornamental
arts. Here we passed a veritable department store, its ground-floor
plate-glass window set as a drawing-room, with gilded, brocaded chairs,
marquetry table, and ormolu clock, and I know not what costliness of rug
and curtain. It was all so strange that it seemed unreal after that long
passage of the savage wilds, that long habitation of huts and igloos and
tents. Hitherto we had often been fortunate could we buy a little flour
and bacon; here the choice comestibles of the earth were for sale. I
looked askance at my greasy parkee as I passed shops where English
broadcloth and Scotch tweeds were displayed; at my worn, clumsy mukluks
when I saw patent-leather pumps. But Nome knows how to welcome the
wanderer from the wilderness and to make him altogether at home. There
could be no warmer hospitality than that with which I was received by
the Reverend John White and his wife, than that which I had at many a
home during my week's stay.

Nothing in the world could have caused the building of a city where Nome
is built except the thing that caused it: the finding of gold on the
beach itself and in the creeks immediately behind it. It has no harbour
or roadstead, no shelter or protection of any kind; it is in as bleak
and exposed a position as a man would find if he should set out to hunt
the earth over for ineligible sites.

But Nome is also a fine instance of the way men in the North conquer
local conditions and wring comfort out of bleakness and desolation by
the clever adaptation of means to ends.

The art of living comfortably in the North had to be learned, and it has
been learned pretty thoroughly. People live at Nome as well as they do
"outside." One may sit down to dinners as well cooked, as well
furnished, as well served as any dinners anywhere. The good folk of Nome
delight in spreading their dainty store before the unjaded appetite of
the winter traveller, and it would be affectation to deny that there is
keen relish of enjoyment in the long-unwonted gleam of wax candle or
electrolier upon perfect appointment of glass, silver, and napery, in
the unobtrusive but vigilant service of white-jacketed Chinaman or Jap.
Nome has a great advantage over its only rival in the interior,
Fairbanks, in the matter of freight rates. The same merchandise that is
landed at the one place for ten or twelve dollars a ton within ten or
twelve days of its leaving Seattle, costs fifty or sixty at the other,
and takes a month or more to arrive. But this accessibility in the
summer is exactly reversed in the winter. No practicable route has been
discovered along the uninhabited shores of Bering Sea, and all the mail
for Nome comes from Valdez to Fairbanks and then down the Yukon and
round Norton Sound by dog team. In winter Fairbanks is within seven or
eight days of open salt water; Nome a full month. After navigation
closes in October, the first mail does not commonly reach the Seward
Peninsula until January. So that, with all its comforts and luxuries,
Nome is a very isolated place for eight months in the year.

[Illustration: GOLD-MINING AT NOME.]

[Illustration: PULLING THE "PELICAN" OUT WITH A "SPANISH WINDLASS."]

[Sidenote: MINING AT NOME]

We went out with the dog sled to the diggings a few miles behind the
town, and a busy scene we found, enveloped in steam and smoke. Here an
old beach line had been discovered and was yielding rich reward for the
working. A long line of conical "dumps" marked its extension roughly
parallel with the present shore, and the buckets that arose from the
depths, travelled along a cable, and at just the right moment upset
their contents, continually added to these heaps. All the winter
"pay-dirt" is thus excavated and stored; in the summer when the streams
run the gold is sluiced out. But that phrase "when the streams run"
covers a world of difficulty and expense to the miner. In some places in
this Seward Peninsula, ditches thirty and forty miles long have been
constructed to insure the streams running when and where they are
needed.

There was quite a little to do in Nome. A new sled must be bought, and
another dog, and, above all, some arrangement made about a travelling
companion. I was not willing to hire a native who would have to return
here, and I was resolved never again to travel alone. So I put an
advertisement in the newspaper, desiring communication with some man who
was intending a journey to Fairbanks immediately, and was fortunate to
meet a sober, reliable man who undertook to accompany and assist me for
the payment of his travelling expenses.

The week wore rapidly away, and I began to be eager to depart, mindful
of the eight hundred odd miles yet to be covered. Spring seemed already
here and summer treading upon her heels, for the town was all slush and
mud from a decided "soft snap," the thermometer standing well above
freezing for days in succession.

A visitor to this place is struck by the number of articles made from
walrus ivory exposed for sale, chief amongst them being cribbage-boards.
A walk down the streets would argue the whole population given over to
the incessant playing of cribbage. The explanation is found in the
difficulty of changing the direction of Esquimau activity once that
direction is established. These clever artificers were started making
cribbage-boards long ago and it seems impossible to stop them. Every
summer they come in from their winter hunting with fresh supplies carved
during the leisure of the long nights. The beautiful walrus tusk becomes
almost an ugly thing when it is thus hacked flat and bored full of
holes. The best pieces of Esquimau carving are not these things, made by
the dozen, but the domestic implements made for their own use, and some
of this work is very clever and tasteful indeed, adorned with fine bold
etchings of the chase of walrus, seal, and polar bear.




CHAPTER V

NOME TO FAIRBANKS--NORTON SOUND--THE KALTAG PORTAGE--NULATO--UP THE
YUKON TO TANANA


WE left Nome on the 13th of March, the night before being taken up by a
banquet which the Commercial Club was kind enough to give me; indeed,
the whole stay was marked by lavish kindness and hospitality, and I left
with the feeling that Nome was one of the most generous and open-handed
places I had ever visited.

The soft weather continued and made sloppy travel. Our course lay all
around Norton Sound to Unalaklík, and then over the portage to Kaltag on
the Yukon; up the Yukon to the mouth of the Tanana, and then up that
river to Fairbanks. The first day's run was the retracing of our steps
to Solomon's, and that was done without difficulty save for a new
trouble with the dogs. It appeared that we no longer had any leader. All
the winter through my team had been behind another team, and that
constant second place had turned our leaders into followers. We thought
we had two leaders, but neither one was willing to proceed without some
one or something ahead of him. On such good ice-going as this it was out
of the question for one of us to run ahead of the team simply to please
these leader-perverts, and the whip had to be wielded heavily on Jimmy's
back ere he could be induced to fill his proper office--and then he did
it ill, with constant exasperating stoppings and lookings-back. At
Solomon's I met a man who had spent some years with Peary in his arctic
explorations, and I sat up far into the night drawing interesting
narratives out of him. So far as Topkok we were still retracing our
steps, but once over the great bluff, which gave no view this time owing
to the mist which accompanies this soft weather, we were on new ground,
our course lying wholly along the beach.

At Bluff was the most interesting, curious gold mining I have ever seen,
the extraction of gold from the sand of Norton Sound, two hundred yards
or more out from the beach. There it lies under ten or twelve feet of
water with the ice on top. How shall it be reached? Why, by the exact
converse of the usual Alaskan placer mining; by freezing down instead of
thawing down. The ice is cut away from the beginning of a shaft, almost
but not quite down to the water, leaving just a thin cake. The
atmospheric cold, penetrating this cake, freezes the water below it, and
presently the hole is chopped down a little farther, leaving always a
thin cake above the water. A canvas chute is arranged over the shaft,
with a head like a ship's ventilator that can be turned any way to catch
the wind. Gradually the water is frozen down, and as it is frozen more
and more ice is removed until the bottom is reached, surrounded and
protected by a cylindrical shaft of ice; then the sand can be removed
and the gold it contains washed out. They told us they were making good
money and their ingenuity certainly deserved it.

[Sidenote: ICE TRAVEL]

We stopped that night at the native village of Chinnik, the people of
which are looked after by a mission of the Swedish Evangelical Church on
Golofnin Bay, which we should cross to-morrow. But the mission is off
the trail, and we did not come to an acquaintance with the missionaries
of this body until we reached Unalaklík. Next day, climbing and
descending considerable grades in warm, misty weather, we reached
Golofnin Bay, pursued it some distance, and left it by a very steep,
long hill that was close to one thousand feet high, at the foot of which
we were once more on the beach of the sound--and at the road-house for
the night. From that place the trail no longer hugged the coast but
struck out boldly across the ice for a distant headland, Moses' Point,
where we lunched, and, that point reached, struck out again for Isaac's
Point, most of the travelling during a long day in which we made
forty-eight miles being four or five miles from land. The day was clear,
and the shore-line of the other side of the sound, which grew nearer as
we proceeded, was subject to strange distortions of mirage. The
road-house that night nestled picturesquely against a great bluff, and
right across the ice lay Texas Point, for which we should make a
bee-line to-morrow. Sometimes the traveller must go all round Norton
Bay, but at this time the ice was in good condition and our route cut
across the mouth of the bay for twenty-two miles straight for the other
side. It was like crossing from Dover to Calais on the ice. The passage
made, the Alaskan mainland was reached once more, the Seward Peninsula
left behind us, and our way lay across desolate, low-lying tundra
strewn with driftwood and hollowed out here and there into little
lagoons. Evidently the waves sweep clean across it in stormy weather
when the sound is open; a salt marsh. In the midst of it reared a sort
of lookout tripod of driftwood thirty or forty feet high, lashed and
nailed together, with a precarious little platform on top and cleats
nailed to one of the uprights for ascent. I essayed the view, but the
rusty nails broke under my feet. We deemed it a hunting tower from which
water-fowl might be spied in the spring. Sixteen miles of this
melancholy waste brought us to the shore again, to a tiny Esquimau
village and a tumble-down, half-buried shack of a road-house where we
should spend the night, a little schooner lying beached in front of it.
If its exterior were uninviting, the scene as we entered was sinister.
By the light of a single candle--though it was not yet dark
outside--amidst unwashed dishes and general grime, sat an evil-eyed
Portuguese or Spaniard, in a red toque, playing poker with three
skin-clad Esquimaux. So absorbed were they in the game that they had not
heard us arrive nor seen us enter. With a brief, reluctant interval for
the preparation of a poor supper, the card playing went on all the
evening far into the night. My companion discovered that the chips were
worth a dollar apiece and judged it to be "considerable of a game." At
last I arose from my bunk and said that we were tired and had come there
to sleep, and with an ill grace the playing was shortly abandoned and
the natives went off. The arctic shores have their beach-combers as well
as the South Sea Islands.

[Sidenote: UNALAKLÍK]

The next day was Sunday, but I was anxious to spend my day of rest at
Unalaklík and most indisposed to spend it here, so we got away with a
very early start long before daylight. Six or seven miles of tundra and
lagoon travel and the trail crossed abruptly a tongue of land and struck
out over the salt-water ice for a cape fifteen miles away. The going was
splendid. It was not glare ice, but ice upon which snow had melted and
frozen again. It was so smooth that one dog could have drawn the sled,
yet not so smooth as to deny good footing. We kept well out to sea,
passing close to the mountainous mass of Besborough Island, plainly
riven by some ancient convulsion from the sheer bluffs of the mainland.
Our only trouble was in keeping the dogs well enough out, for, not being
water-spaniels or other marine species, they had a hankering after the
land and a continual tendency to edge in to shore.

So from headland to headland we made rapid, easy traverse, thoroughly
enjoying the ride, munching chocolate and raisins, speculating about the
seasons when it had been possible to cross direct from Nome to Saint
Michael on the ice, and exchanging stories we had heard of the disasters
and hairbreadth escapes attending such overbold venture. Only this
winter three men and a dog team were blown out into Bering Sea by a
sudden storm, and lay for four days in their sleeping-bags drifting up
and down on an ice cake, until at last they were blown back to the shore
ice and made their escape. And there is a fine story of a white man
rescued in half-frozen state by his Esquimau wife, and carried for miles
on her back to safety.

At last we turned a point and drew in to the shore, and, not seeing the
little town till we were almost upon it, arrived at Unalaklík early in
the afternoon. We had made the two hundred and forty miles, as it is
called, from Nome, in six days. In the last twelve days of travel we had
covered five hundred miles, an average of nearly forty-two miles per
day, far and away the best travelling of the winter. The preceding five
hundred miles had taken twenty-two days.

We were in time to attend the Esquimau services at the mission both
afternoon and night, and I found them very much the same as at
Kikitaruk, with the exception that the singing was much more advanced
and was very good indeed. There was an anthem of the Danks type sung by
a choir--the parts well maintained throughout, the attacks good, the
voices under excellent control--that it pleased and surprised me to
hear, and there was a long discourse most patiently and, as I judged,
faithfully interpreted by a bright-looking Esquimau boy. It is well for
those who speak much through an interpreter to listen occasionally to
similar discourse. Only so may its unavoidable tediousness be
appreciated.

[Sidenote: GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS]

The school next day pleased me still more, and I was glad that I had a
school-day at the place. I heard good reading and spelling, saw good
writing, and listened with real enjoyment to the fresh young voices
raised again and again in song. There was, however, something so
curiously exotic that for a moment it seemed irresistibly funny, in "The
Old Oaken Bucket," from lips that have difficulty with the vowel sounds
of English; from children that never saw a well and never will see
one;--and I was irreverent enough to have much the same feeling about "I
love thy templed hills," etc., in that patriotic Plymouth Rock song
which is so little adapted for universal American use that, in a gibe
not without justice, it has been called "Smith's Country, 'tis of Thee."
One wonders if they sing it in the Philippine schools; and, so far as
these regions are concerned, one wishes that some teacher with a spark
of genius would take Goldsmith's hint and write a simple song for
Esquimau children that should

        "Extol the treasures of their finny seas
         And their long nights of revelry and ease";

the splendour of summer's perpetual sunshine and the weird radiance of
the Northern Lights; but prosody is not taught in your "Normal" school.
The thing is a vain, artificial attempt to impose a whole body of ideas,
notions, standards of comparison, metaphors, similes, and sentiments
upon a race to which, in great measure, they must ever be foreign and
unintelligible. Here were girls reading in a text-book of so-called
physiology, and, as it happened, the lesson that day was on the evils of
tight lacing! The reading of that book, I was informed, is imposed by
special United States statute, and the teacher must make a separate
report that so much of it has been duly gone through each month before
the salary can be drawn. Yet none of those girls ever saw a corset or
ever will. One is reminded of the dear old lady who used to visit the
jails and distribute tracts on _The Evils of Keeping Bad Company_.

But these incongruities aside, the school was a good school and well
taught, the government appointing the teachers, as I learned, upon the
nomination of the mission authorities; the only way that a government
school can be successful at any mission station, for the two agencies
must work together, as one's right hand works with one's left, to effect
any satisfactory result. The hours spent in it were very enjoyable, and
one wished one might have had opportunity for further acquaintance with
some of the bright-faced, interesting children, both full-bloods and
half-breeds.

Unalaklík is a thriving Esquimau community, noted for its native
schooner building and its successful seal hunters and fishermen. We were
rejoiced to see signs of native prosperity and advance, and we left
Unalaklík with high hope for its future.

Here also was real rest and refreshment at a road-house. Road-houses in
Alaska are as various in quality as inns are "outside." Our previous
night's halt was at one of the worst; this was one of the best. The
proprietor was a good cook and he did his best for us, with omelet and
pastry, and young, tender reindeer. It has been said that road-house
keeping in Alaska is like soliciting life insurance "outside," the last
resort of incompetence. Certain it is that a thoroughly lazy and
incompetent man may yet make a living keeping a road-house, for there is
no rivalry save at the more important points, and travellers are
commonly so glad to reach any shelter that they are not disposed to be
censorious. None the less, when they find a man who takes a pride in his
business and an interest in the comfort of his guests, they are highly
appreciative.

[Sidenote: THE KALTAG PORTAGE]

We should have only an occasional road-house from now on, but expected
to reach some inhabited cabin each night. Our good travelling was over
though we did not know it. We knew that the hard snows of the Seward
Peninsula and the bare ice of Norton Sound were behind us, but we kept
telling ourselves that the travel of all the winter would surely have
left a fine trail on the Yukon. We were now about sixty-five miles from
Saint Michael, by the coast. But taking the ninety-mile portage from
Unalaklík to Kaltag we should reach the Yukon River more than five
hundred miles above Saint Michael, so much does that portage cut off.
This is the route the military telegraph-line takes, and we should
travel along close beside it much of the way until the Yukon was
reached.

The soft weather persisted, and we had even doubt about starting out in
such a rapid thaw. A visit to the telegraph station informed us that the
warm wave was spread all over interior Alaska and that there was general
expectation of an early break-up. But if the snow on the portage were
indeed rapidly going, that was all the more reason for getting across
before it had altogether gone; so we pulled out in the warm, muggy
weather, and even as we pulled out it began to rain!

Up the little Unalaklík River, water over the ice everywhere, we went
for a few miles and then took to the tundra. All the snow had gone
except just the hard snow of the trail, a winding ribbon of white across
the brown moss. The rain changed to sleet and back to rain again, and
soon we were wet through and had much trouble in keeping that
penetrating, persistent drizzle from wetting our load through the canvas
cover. Though not an unique experience, it is rare to be wet with rain
on the winter trail--rarer in the interior probably than on the coast.
Once since on the Kuskokwim and once on the Fortymile it has happened to
me in seven winters' travel. We pushed on for thirty miles, past several
little native villages, until we came to Whaleback, a village part
Esquimau and part Indian. These were the last Esquimaux we should see,
and I was sorry, for I had grown to like very heartily and to respect
very sincerely this kindly, gentle, industrious, good-humoured race.
Surely they are a people any nation may be proud to have fringing its
otherwise uninhabitable coasts, and should be eager to aid and conserve.
There comes a feeling of impotent exasperation to me when I realise how
many white men there are who speak of them continually with the utmost
contempt and see them dwindle with entire complacency. The same thing is
true in even more marked degree about the Indians of the interior: nine
tenths of the land will never have other inhabitant, of that I am
convinced, and the only question is, shall it be an inhabited wilderness
or an uninhabited wilderness? Here, lodging with the natives, and, I
make no doubt, living off them too, we found a queer, skulking white man
whom I had met in several different sections of interior Alaska, known
as "Snow-shoe Joe" or "The Frozen Hobo." The arctic regions one would
esteem a poor place for the hobo, but this man manages to eke out an
existence, if not to flourish, therein. Work he will not under any
circumstances, but subsists on the hospitality of the whites until he
has entirely worn it out and then removes to the natives, mushing from
camp to camp and "bumming" his way as he goes. He was on his way to
Saint Michael, he told me with perfect gravity, "to get work."

[Sidenote: THE U. S. SIGNAL-CORPS]

Before dark we had reached our destination for the night at the Old
Woman Mountain, the divide between the waters of the Yukon and the
waters of Norton Sound, and were kindly received and well treated at the
telegraph station, the only resort on this portage for weary travellers.
Here is surely a lonely post. For reasons connected with the maintenance
of the wires and the keeping open of communications, it is necessary to
have telegraph stations every forty or fifty miles, each with two or
three men and a dog team, and shelter cabins about half-way between
stations. A wind that blows a tree down in the narrow right-of-way cut
through the forest--for we were come to forest again--or a heavy
snowfall that loads branches until they fall across the wires, a post
that comes up out of its hole as the thawing of spring heaves the ground
around it, or the caving of the bank of a stream along which the line
passes--any one of a dozen such happenings anywhere along its thousand
miles of course, may put the entire inland telegraph system out of
operation; and the young men in whose section the interruption
occurs--they have a means of determining that--must get out at once,
find the seat of the trouble and repair it. In all sorts of weather,
unless the thermometer be below -40°, out they must go.

It may be doubted if any other army in the world ever constructed and
maintained a permanent telegraph line under such arduous conditions. It
has been the army's one contribution to Alaska, the one justification
for the enormous expense of maintaining army posts in the interior.
Indeed it is often said by those who feel keenly the neglect of the
territory by the general government that this telegraph system is the
one contribution of the United States to Alaska. It is certainly a great
public convenience and has assisted very materially in such development
as the country has made. The men of the signal-corps deserve great
credit for the faithful, dogged way in which they have carried out year
after year their difficult and hazardous work, and often and often the
weather-stressed traveller has been grateful for the hospitality which
their cabins have afforded him.

They have not been an unmixed blessing to the country; soldiers do not
usually represent the highest morale of the nation, and though the
signal-corps is in some respect a picked corps, yet the men are
soldiers, with many of the soldier characteristics. Too often a remote
telegraph station has been a little centre of drunkenness, gambling, and
debauchery with a little circumference of native men and women, and
while some of the officers of the corps have been willing and anxious to
do all in their power to suppress this sort of thing in their scattered
and difficult commands, others have been jealous only for the technical
efficiency of their work.

[Sidenote: MORE SNOW]

There are many allowances to be made for young men taken from the
society of their kind and thrust out hundreds of miles in the wilderness
to sit down for a year or two at one of these isolated spots. They may
see no women save those amongst a straggling band of Indians for the
whole time of their exile; they may see no white man save a
mail-carrier--and in many places not even a mail-carrier--for weeks
together. Time sometimes hangs very heavily on their hands, for trees
are not always blowing down, nor wires snapping through the tension of
the cold, and at some stations there will not be a dozen telegraph
messages sent the whole winter through. If a young man be at all
ambitious of self-improvement, here is splendid opportunity of leisure,
but a great many are not at all so disposed. Character, except the most
firmly founded, is apt to deteriorate under such circumstances;
standards of conduct to be lowered. And what is here written of the
young men of the signal-corps may well apply in great measure to a large
proportion of all the white men in the country.

The "eighty-mile portage" we had heard of at Nome became ninety miles at
Unalaklík, and added another five to itself here, so that although we
had travelled forty-two miles that day we were told that there were yet
fifty-three ahead before we reached the Yukon.

So we decided not to attempt it in one day and to rest the next night at
a "repair cabin" twenty-eight miles farther, making a somewhat late
start in view of a short journey. It had been wiser to have started
early. During our night at Old Woman Mountain some three inches of snow
fell, and we found as we descended the Yukon slope that all the moisture
that had fallen upon us as rain the previous day had fallen on this side
as snow. The trail was filled full and buried, and so soft and mushy was
it that although snow-shoes were badly needed they were impossible. The
snow clung to them and came off the ground with them in heavy, clogging
masses every time they were lifted. It clung to the sled, to the
harness, to the dogs' feet, to everything that touched it; it gathered
in ever-increasing snowballs on the long hair of the dogs. Travelling in
warm weather in loose, new snow is most disagreeable work. We plugged
along for twenty miles, and then in the dark in an open country with
little patches of scattering spruce, had great trouble in finding the
trail at all.

At last we could find it no longer, and when there was no hope of
reaching the cabin that night we made a camp. We had now no tent or
stove with us, so a "Siwash camp" in the open was the best we could do,
and a wet, miserable camp it was. By inexcusable carelessness on my
part, candles had been altogether forgotten in the replenishing of the
supplies, and a little piece an inch long which we found loose in the
grub box was all that we possessed. Dogs and men alike exhausted with
the long day's sweating struggle through the deep snow, sleep should
have come soundly and soon. It did to the rest, but I lay awake the
night through. The easy, riding travel of the preceding week had been a
poor preparation for to-day's incessant toil, and I was too tired to
sleep. In the morning our bedding was covered with a couple of inches
of new snow. My companion got up at daylight and made a journey of
investigation ahead, following the trail better, but not finding the
cabin. We had thought ourselves within a mile or two of it, but
evidently were farther away. However, when we had eaten a hasty
breakfast and hitched up and had gone along the trail that had been
broken that morning to its end, ten yards beyond the place where my
companion had turned back, we came in sight of the cabin, and there we
lay and rested and dried things out all day and spent the next night.
During the day there came a team from Kaltag, and once again we enjoyed
the delight of receiving, and at the same time conferring, the richest
gift and greatest possible benefit to the traveller--a trail.

[Sidenote: THE YUKON ONCE MORE]

The next evening as it drew towards dark, after another day of soft,
warm disagreeable travel, we reached the end of the portage, and the
broad white Yukon stretched before us once more. Our hearts leaped up
and I think the dogs' hearts leaped up also at the sight. I called to
Nanook as we stopped on the bank, "Nanook, there's the good old Yukon
again!" and he lifted his voice in that intelligent, significant bark
that surely meant that he saw and understood. We had left the Yukon on
the 15th of December at Fort Yukon; we reached it again on the 23d of
March at Kaltag, more than six hundred miles lower down. We had two
hundred and fifty miles of travel on its surface before us, and then
close to another two hundred and fifty up the Tanana River to Fairbanks.
But alas! for the fine Yukon trail we had promised ourselves! As we
looked out across the broad river there was no narrow, dark line
undulating over its surface, nor even a faint, continuous inequality to
hint that trail had been, on snow "less hideously serene"; its perfect
smoothness and whiteness were unscarred and unsullied. The trail was
wiped out and swallowed up by the late snows and winds.

[Sidenote: A LEARNED JESUIT]

There is little interest in lingering over the long, laborious,
monotonous grind up that river on show-shoes. When one has looked
forward to pleasant, quick travel, the disappointment at slow, heavy
plodding is the keener. The first little bit of trail we had was as we
approached Nulato two days later on a Sunday morning, and it was made by
the villagers from below going up to church at the Roman Catholic
mission. We arrived in time for service, and enjoyed the natives' voices
raised in the Latin chants as well as in hymns wisely put into the
vernacular. It is historically a little curious to find Roman Catholic
natives singing praises in their own tongue, and Protestant missions,
like those on the Kobuk and Kotzebue Sound, using a language "not
understanded of the people." The day was the Feast of the Annunciation
as well as Sunday, and there was some special decorating of the church
and perhaps some elaboration of the music. Here for the first and only
time I listened to a white man so fluent and vigorous in the native
tongue that he gave one the impression of eloquence. Father Jetté of the
Society of Jesus is the most distinguished scholar in Alaska. He is the
chief authority on the native language, and manners and customs, beliefs
and traditions of the Middle Yukon, and has brought to the patient,
enthusiastic labour of years the skill of the trained philologist. It
is said by the Indians that he knows more of the Indian language than
any one of them does, and this is not hard to believe when it is
understood that he has systematically gleaned his knowledge from widely
scattered segments of tribes, jotting down in his note-books old forms
of speech lingering amongst isolated communities, and legends and
folk-lore stories still remembered by the aged but not much repeated
nowadays; always keen to add to his store or to verify or disprove some
etymological conjecture that has occurred to his fertile mind. His work
is recognised by the ethnological societies of Europe, and much of his
collected material has been printed in their technical journals.

A man of wide general culture, master of three or four modern, as well
as the classic, languages, a mathematician, a writer of beautiful, clear
English, although it is not his mother tongue, he carries it with the
modesty, the broad-minded tolerance, the easy urbanity that always
adorn, though they by no means always accompany, the profession of the
scholar; and one is better able to understand after some years'
acquaintance with such a man, after falling under the authority of his
learning and the charm of his courtesy, the wonderful power which the
society he belongs to has wielded in the world. If such devotion to the
instruction of the ignorant as was described at the mission on the
middle Kobuk be praiseworthy, by how much the more is one moved to
admiration at the spectacle of this man, who might fill with credit any
one of half a dozen professional chairs at the ordinary college, gladly
consecrating his life to the teaching of an Indian school!

Hearing an interest expressed in the massacre which took place at Nulato
in 1851, Father Jetté offered to accompany us to the site of that
occurrence, about a mile away. It stands out prominently in the history
of a country that has been singularly free from bloodshed and outrage,
and its date is the notable date of the middle river, as the
establishment of the post at Fort Yukon by the Hudson Bay Company in
1846 is the notable date of the upper river. They are fixed points in
Indian chronology by which it is possible to approximate other dates and
to reach an estimate of the ages of old people.

[Sidenote: THE NULATO MASSACRE]

Much has been written about the Nulato massacre, and the accounts vary
in many particulars. The Russian post here was first established by
Malakof in 1838. Burned during his absence by the Indians, it was
re-established by Lieutenant Zagoskin of the Russian navy in 1842. The
extortions and cruelties of his successor, Deerzhavin, complicated by a
standing feud between two native tribes, and probably having the rival
powers of certain medicine-men as the match to the mine, brought about
the destruction of the place and the death of all its inhabitants, white
and native, by a sudden treacherous attack of the Koyukuk Indians. It
happened that Lieutenant Barnard of the British navy, detached from a
war-ship lying at Saint Michael to journey up the river and make
inquiries of the Koyukuk natives as to wandering white men, survivors of
Sir John Franklin's expedition, who might have been seen or heard of by
them, was staying at the post at the time and perished in the general
massacre. His grave, with a headboard bearing a Latin inscription, is
neatly kept up by the Jesuit priests at Nulato.

In the last few years the river has been invading the bank upon which
the old village stood, and as the earth caves in relics of the slaughter
and burning come to light. Old copper kettles and samovars, buttons and
glass beads, all sorts of metal vessels and implements have been sorted
out from charred wood and ashes, together with numerous skulls and
quantities of bones. One of the most interesting of these relics was a
brass button from an official coat, with the Russian crowned
double-headed eagle on the face, and on the back, upon examination with
a lens, the word "Birmingham."

Half the day serving for our day of rest this week, we were up and ready
to start early the next morning, but so violent a wind was blowing from
the southeast that we decided to remain, and the clatter of the
corrugated iron roof and the whirling whiteness outside the windows made
us glad to be in shelter. As the day advanced the wind increased to
almost hurricane force, and the two-story house in which we lay began to
rock in such a manner as to make the proprietor alarmed for his
dwelling.

There was an "independent" trading-post at this village which seemed to
present an object-lesson in rapacity and greed. There was not an article
of standard quality in the store; the clothing was the most rascally
shoddy, the canned goods of the poorest brands; the whole stock the
cheapest stuff that could possibly be bought at bargain prices
"outside," yet the prices were higher even than those that prevail in
Alaska for the best merchandise. Loud complaints are often made against
the commercial corporation which does the great bulk of the business in
interior Alaska, yet if the writer had to choose whether he would be in
the hands of that company or in the hands of an "independent" trader, he
would unhesitatingly cast in his lot with the company. The independent
trader makes money, sometimes makes large money, and makes it fairly
easily, but the calling seems to appeal mainly, if not wholly, to men of
low character and no conscience. There are few things that would redound
more to the benefit of the Indian than a great improvement in the
character of the men with whom he is compelled to do business.

The wind had subsided by the next morning and had been of benefit rather
than injury to us, for it had blown the accumulated new snow off the old
trail so that it was possible to perceive and follow it. But what was
our surprise to find, with the recollection of that rattling roof and
swaying building fresh in our minds, that ten miles away there had been
no wind at all! The snow lay undisturbed on every twig and bough from
which the gentlest breeze would have dislodged it. One never ceases to
wonder at what, for want of a better word, must be called the
_localness_ of much of the weather in Alaska--though, for that matter,
in all probability it is characteristic of weather in all countries. The
habit of continual outdoor travel gives scope as well as edge to one's
observation of such things which a life in one place denies. That
wind-storm had cut a clean swath across the Yukon valley. Yet it seems
strange that so violent a disturbance could take place without affecting
and, to some extent, agitating the atmosphere for many miles adjacent.

[Sidenote: SNOW GLASSES]

So, sometimes in snow-storm, sometimes in wind, always on snow-shoes and
often hard put to it to find and follow the trail at all, we struggled
on for two or three days more, sleeping one night at a wood-chopper's
hut, another in a telegraph cabin crowded with foul-mouthed infantrymen
sent out to repair the extensive damage of the recent storm and none too
pleased at the detail, we plodded our weary way up that interminable
river. At last we met the mail-man, that ever-welcome person on the
Alaskan trail, and his track greatly lightened our labour. By his
permission we broke into his padlocked cabin that night by the skilful
application of an axe-edge to a link of the chain, and were more
comfortable than we had been for some time. Past the mouth of the
Koyukuk, past Grimcop, past Lowden, past Melozikaket to Kokrine's and
Mouse Point, we plugged along, making twenty-two miles one day and
thirty another and then dropping again to eighteen. The temperature
dropped to zero, and a keen wind made it necessary to keep the nose
continually covered. At this time of year the covering of the nose
involves a fresh annoyance, for it deflects the breath upward, and the
moisture of it continually condenses on the snow glasses, which means
continual wiping. A stick of some sort of waxy compound to be rubbed
upon the glass, bought in New York as a preventive of the deposit of
moisture, proved entirely useless. In this respect the Esquimau snow
goggle, which is simply a piece of wood hollowed out into a cup and
illuminated by narrow slits, has advantage over any shape or kind of
glass protection. A French metal device of the same order that is
advertised in the dealer's catalogues was found to fail, perhaps owing
to a wrong optical arrangement of the slits. It caused an eye-strain
that brought on headache. But if that principle could be scientifically
worked out and such a device perfected, it would be a boon to the
traveller over sun-lit snow, for it would do away with glass altogether,
with its two chief objections--its fragility and its opacity when
covered with vapour.

[Sidenote: SNOW-BLINDNESS]

The indispensability of some eye protection when travelling in the late
winter, and the serious consequences that follow its neglect, were once
again demonstrated at Mouse Point. The road-house was crowded with
"busted" stampeders coming out of the Nowikaket country. There had been
a report of a rich "strike" on a creek of the Nowitna, late the previous
fall, and a number of men from other camps--some from as far as
Nome--had gone in there with "outfits" for the winter. The stampede had
been a failure; no gold was found; there was much indignant assertion
that no gold ever _had_ been found and that the reported "strike" was a
"fake," though to what end or profit such a "fake" stampede should be
caused, unless by some neighbouring trader, it is hard to understand;
and here were the stampeders streaming out again, a ragged, unkempt,
sorry-looking crowd in every variety of worn-out arctic toggery, many
of them suffering from acute snow-blindness. It is surprising that even
old-timers will go out in the hills for the whole winter without
providing themselves with protection against the glare of the sun which
they know will inevitably assail their eyes before the spring, yet so it
is; and this lack of forethought is not confined to the matter of snow
glasses: the first half dozen men we received in Saint Matthew's
Hospital at Fairbanks suffering from severely frozen feet were all
old-timers grown careless.

Father Ragarou, another Jesuit priest of another type, reached the
road-house from the opposite direction about the same time we did, and I
was interested in watching his treatment of the inflamed eyes. Upon a
disk of lead he folded a little piece of cotton cloth in the shape of a
tent, and, setting fire to it, allowed it to burn out completely. Then
with a wet camel's-hair brush he gathered up the slight yellow residuum
of the combustion and painted it over the eyes, holding the lids open
with thumb and finger and drawing the brush through and through. An
incredulous spectator, noticing the sacred monogram neatly stamped upon
the disk of lead, made some sneering remark to me about "Romish
superstition," but remembering the Jesuit's bark, and recalling that I
had in my writing-case at that moment a letter I had brought all the way
from the Koyukuk addressed to this very priest, begging for a further
supply of a pile ointment that had proved efficacious, I held my peace.
Whether it be an oxide or a carbonate, or some salt that is formed by
the combustion, I am not chemist enough to know, but I saw man after man
relieved by this application. Even the scoffer was convinced there was
merit in the treatment, though stoutly protesting that "them letters"
had nothing to do with it; which nobody took the trouble to argue with
him. My own custom--we are all of us doctors of a sort in this
country--is to instil a few drops of a five-per-cent solution of
cocaine, which gives immediate temporary relief, and then apply frequent
washes of boric acid, bandaging up the eyes completely in bad cases by
cloths kept wet with the solution. But I do not know that it brings
better result than the lead treatment. Certainly it is a matter in which
an ounce of any sort of prevention is better than a pound of any sort of
cure. The affection is a serious one, being nothing more or less than
acute ophthalmia; the pain is very severe, and repeated attacks are said
to bring permanent weakness of the eyes. Smoked glasses or goggles,[A]
veils of green or blue or black, even a crescent eye-shade cut out of a
piece of birch-bark or cardboard and blackened on its under-side with
charcoal, will prevent the hours and sometimes days of torture which
this distemper entails.

[Sidenote: HORSES AND MULES]

For a few miles we had the trail of the stampeders, but when that
crossed the river we put on our snow-shoes and settled to the steady
grind once more. A day's mush brought us to "The Birches," and another
to Gold Mountain. Between the two places there was a portage, and the
trail thereon, protected by the timber, was good. We longed for the time
when all trails in Alaska shall be taken off the rivers and cut in the
protecting forest. But we had gone but a mile along this good trail
when our hearts sank, for we saw ahead of us a procession of army mules
packing supplies from Fort Gibbon to the telegraph repair parties. We
pulled out into the snow that the mules might pass, and the soldiers
said no word, for they knew just how we felt, until the last soldier
leading the last mule was going by, and he turned round and said: "And
her name was Maud!" It was in the height of Opper's popularity, his
"comic supplements" the chief dependence of the road-houses for
wall-paper. The reference was so apposite that we burst into laughter,
but there was nothing funny about the devastation that had been wrought.
That good trail was all gone--the bottom pounded out of it--and nothing
was left but a ploughed lane punched full of sink-holes. We had no
trouble following the trail on the river after this encounter, but it
had been almost as easy going to have struck out for ourselves in the
unbroken snow of the winter. It is hard to make outsiders understand how
a man who loves all animals may come to hate horses and mules,
particularly mules, in this country. Our travelling is above all a
matter of surface. Distance counts and weather counts, but surface
counts for more than either. See how fast we came across the Seward
Peninsula in the most distressing weather imaginable! A well-used dog
trail becomes so hard and smooth that it offers scarce any resistance to
the passage of the sled, and for walking or running over in moccasins or
mukluks is the most perfect surface imaginable. The more it is used the
better it becomes. But put a horse on that trail and in one passage it
is ruined. The iron-shod hoofs break through the crust at every step and
throw up the broken pieces as they are withdrawn. With mules it is even
worse; the holes they punch are deeper and sharper. Neither man nor dog
can pass over it again in comfort. One slips and slides about at every
step, the leg leaders and ankle sinews are strained, the soles of the
feet, though hardened by a thousand miles in moccasins, become sore and
inflamed, and at night there is a new sort of weariness that only a
horse-ruined trail gives. As a rule, the dog trail is of so little
service to the horse or mule that it were as cheap to break out a new
one in the snow, and it is this knowledge that exasperates the dog
musher. So there is not much love lost between the horse man and the dog
man in Alaska.

[Sidenote: ARMY POSTS AND NATIVES]

At last, after a night at "Old Station," we came in sight of Tanana,
where is Fort Gibbon, the one the name of the town and the post-office,
the other the name of the military post and the telegraph office. The
military authorities refuse to call their post "Fort Tanana" and the
postal authorities refuse to allow the town post-office to be called
"Fort Gibbon," so there they lie, cheek by jowl, two separate places
with a fence between them--a source of endless confusion. A letter
addressed to Fort Gibbon is likely to go astray and a telegram addressed
to Tanana to be refused. Stretching along a mile and a half of river
bank, and beginning to come into view ten miles before they are reached,
the military and commercial structures gradually separate themselves.
Here to the left are the ugly frame buildings--all painted
yellow--barracks, canteen, officers' quarters, hospital, commissariat,
and so on. Two clumsy water-towers give height without dignity--a
quality denied to military architecture in Alaska. To the right the town
begins, and an irregular row of one and two story buildings, stores,
warehouses, drinking shops, straggle along the water-front.

Unlike most towns in interior Alaska, Tanana does not depend upon an
adjacent mining camp. It owes its existence first to its geographical
position as the central point of interior Alaska, at the confluence of
the Tanana and Yukon Rivers. Most of the freight and passenger traffic
for Fairbanks and the upper river is transshipped at Tanana, and
extensive stocks of merchandise are maintained there. The army post is
the other important factor in the town's prosperity, and is especially
accountable for the number of saloons. Not only the soldiers, but many
civilian employees, are supported by the post, and when it is understood
that three thousand cords of wood are burned annually in the military
reservation, it will be seen that quite a number of men must find work
as choppers and haulers for the wood contractors. Setting aside the
maintenance of the telegraph service, which has already been referred
to, it may be said without unfairness that the salient activities of the
army in the interior of Alaska are the consumption of whisky and wood.
There is no opportunity for military training--for more than six months
in the year it is impossible to drill outdoors--and the officers
complain of the retrogression of their men in all soldierly
accomplishments during the two years' detail in Alaska. Whether the
prosperity of the liquor dealer be in any real sense the prosperity of
the country, and whether the rapid destruction of the forest be
compensated for by the wages paid to its destroyers, may reasonably be
doubted.

Three miles away is a considerable native village where the mission of
Our Saviour of the Episcopal Church is situated, with an attractive
church building and a picturesque graveyard. The evil influence which
the town and the army post have exerted upon the Indians finds its
ultimate expression in the growth of the graveyard and the dwindling of
the village.

This point at the junction of the two rivers was an important place for
the inhabitants of interior Alaska ages before the white man reached the
country. Tribes from all the middle Yukon, from the lower Yukon, from
the Tanana, from the upper Kuskokwim met here for trading and for
general festivity. It is impossible nowadays to determine when first the
white man's merchandise began to penetrate into this country, but it was
long before the white man came himself. Such prized and portable
articles as axes and knives passed from hand to hand and from tribe to
tribe over many hundreds of miles. Captain Cook, in 1778, found
implements of white man's make in the hands of the natives of the great
inlet that was named for him after his death, and they pointed to the
Far East as the direction whence they had come. He judged that they had
been brought from the Hudson Bay factories clean across the continent.
There are many Indians still living who remember when they saw the
first white man, and some were well grown at the time, but diligent
inquiry has failed to discover one who ever saw a stone axe used, though
some old men have been found who declared that their fathers, when
young, used that implement. Traces have been discovered of the
importation of edge-tools from four directions--from the mouth of the
Yukon; from the Lynn Canal, by way of the headwaters of the Yukon; from
the Prince William Sound, by way of the headwaters of the Tanana; as
well as from the Hudson Bay posts in the Canadian Northwest, by way of
the Porcupine River.

When the Russians established themselves at Nulato in 1842, and the
Hudson Bay Company put a post at Fort Yukon in 1846, Nuchalawóya, as
Tanana was called, became the scene of commercial rivalry, and it is
said that by the meeting of the agents and voyageurs of the two
companies at this point the identity of the Yukon and Quikpak Rivers was
discovered.

The stories that linger with the village ancients of the great numbers
of Indians who used to inhabit the country are doubtless based upon
recollections of the gathering at old Nuchalawóya, when furs were
brought here from far and wide, when there was no other place of
merchandise in mid-Alaska. Now almost every Indian village has a trader
and a store. That the race has diminished, and in most places is still
diminishing, is beyond question, but that it was ever very largely
numerous the natural conditions of the country forbid us to believe.

[Sidenote: WHISKY-PEDDLERS]

During the Reverend Jules Prevost's time at Tanana--and he was in
residence in the year of this journey--from careful vital statistics
kept during two periods of five years each, the race seemed barely to be
holding its own; but since that time there has been a considerable
decline, coincident with the increase of drunkenness and debauchery at
the village when Mr. Prevost's firm hand and watchful eye were
withdrawn. The situation tends to grow worse, and while one does not
give up hope, for that would mean to give up serious effort, the outlook
for the Indians at this place seems unfavourable. Two hundred soldiers,
six or eight liquor shops,--the number varies from year to year,--three
miles off a native village of perhaps one hundred and fifty souls, and
dotting those intervening miles cabins chiefly occupied by "bootleggers"
and go-betweens--that is the Tanana situation in a nutshell. The men
desire the native girls, and the liquor is largely a lure to get them.
Tuberculosis and venereal disease are rife, and the two make a terribly
fatal combination amongst Indians.

It was good to enjoy Mr. and Mrs. Prevost's hospitality, and it was good
to speak through such an admirable interpreter as Paul. Something more
than intelligence and knowledge of the languages are required to make a
good interpreter; there must be sympathy and the ability to take fire.
With such an interpreter, leaping at the speaker's thoughts, carrying
himself entirely into his changing moods, rising to vehemence with him
and again dropping to gentleness, forgetting himself in his
identification with his principal, there is real pleasure in speaking to
the natives who hang upon his vicarious lips. On the other hand, one of
the most intelligent mission interpreters in the country is also so
phlegmatic in disposition, so lifeless and monotonous in his speech, and
particularly so impassive of countenance, that he reminds one of
Napoleon's saying about Talleyrand: that if some one kicked him behind
while he was speaking to you his face would give no sign of it at all.

[Sidenote: CHENA AND FAIRBANKS]

It is not necessary to write much detail of the two-hundred-mile journey
to Fairbanks up the Tanana River. The trail was then wholly on the
river, but now it has been taken wholly off, as every Alaskan musher
hopes some day will be done with all trails. The region about the mouth
of the river and for some miles up is one of the windiest in the
country, and there is always troublesome crossing of bare sand-bars and
of ice over which sand has been blown. The journey hastens to its close;
men and dogs alike realise it, and push on willingly over longer stages
than they had before attempted.

Two days from Tanana we were luxuriating in the natural hot springs near
Baker Creek, wallowing in the crude wooden vat, when "Daddy Karstner"
had shovelled enough snow in to make entering the water possible, and
emerging ruddy as boiled lobsters. It was a beautiful and interesting
spot then, with noble groves of birch and the finest grove of
cottonwood-trees in Alaska--all cut down now--all ruined in a plunging
and bounding and quite unsuccessful attempt to make a "Health Resort" of
the place for the "smart set" of Fairbanks. It is a scurvy trick of
Fortune when she gives large wealth to a man with no feeling for trees.
We spent Sunday there and roamed over the curious domain, snow-free
amidst all the surrounding snow, rank in vegetation amidst the
yet-lingering winter death; and then we wallowed again.

Tolovana, Nenana, and then one long run of fifty-four miles, the longest
and last run of the winter, and--Chena and Fairbanks. But just before we
reached Chena, as we passed the fish camp where the dogs had been
boarded the previous summer, Nanook stopped the whole team, looked up at
the bank and gave utterance to his pronounced five barks on the
descending scale. None of the other dogs seemed to notice or recognise
the place, but Nanook said as plainly as if he had uttered speech:
"Well, well! there's where I spent last summer!"

We reached Fairbanks on the 11th of April, in time for Good Friday and
Easter, after an absence of four months and a half--with the accumulated
mail of all that period awaiting me. The distance covered was about
twenty-two hundred miles, three fourths of it on foot, more than half of
it on snow-shoes. At Chena I had called up the hospital at Fairbanks on
the telephone, and the exchange operator had immediately recognised my
voice and bidden me welcome; but when I reached Fairbanks, a light beard
that I had suffered to grow during the winter made me unrecognisable by
those who knew me best. So effectually does a beard disguise a man and
so surely may his voice identify him.

CHAPTER VI

THE "FIRST ICE"--AN AUTUMN ADVENTURE ON THE KOYUKUK


IT is not attempted in this narrative to give separate account of all
the journeys with which it deals. That would involve much repetition and
tedious detail. Our long journey has been described from start to
finish, taking the reader far north of the Yukon, then almost to the
extreme west of Alaska, and then round by the Yukon to mid-Alaska again.
It is proposed now to give sketches of such parts of other journeys as
do not cover the same ground, and they will lie, with one exception,
south of the Yukon. While visiting many of the same points every winter,
it has been within the author's good fortune and contrivance to include
each year some new stretch of country, sometimes searching out and
visiting a new tribe of natives, and blazing the way for the
establishment of permanent missionary work amongst them. To these
initial journeys belongs a zest that no subsequent travels in the same
region ever have; there is a keen interest in what every new turn of a
trail shall bring, every new bend of a river; there is eagerness rising
with one's rising steps to excitement for the view from a new mountain
pass; above all, there is deep satisfaction coupled with a sense of
solemn responsibility in being the first to reach some remote band of
Indians and preach to them the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. There
are few men nowadays on the North American continent to whom that
privilege remains.

A period of nearly three years elapses between the beginning of the
journey that has already been described and the short sketch of a
journey that follows. Many things had happened in those three years. It
had been the happy duty of the writer to return to the Koyukuk late in
the winter of 1906-7, empowered to build the promised mission for the
hitherto neglected natives of that region. Pitching tent at a spot
opposite the mouth of the Alatna, with the aid of a skilled carpenter
and a couple of axemen brought from the mining district above, and the
labour of the Indians, the little log church and the mission house were
put up and prepared for the two ladies--a trained nurse and a
teacher--who should arrive on the first steamboat. The steamboat that
brought them in carried him out on its return trip, and the next year
was spent in the States making known the needs of the work in Alaska and
securing funds for its advancement.

[Sidenote: DOCTOR GRAFTON BURKE]

On my return I brought with me a young physician, Doctor Grafton Burke,
as a medical missionary, and a half-breed Alaskan youth, Arthur, who had
been at school in California, as attendant and interpreter. A
thirty-two-foot gasoline launch designed for the Yukon and its
tributaries was also brought and was launched at the head of Yukon
navigation at Whitehouse. The voyages of the _Pelican_ on almost all the
navigable waters of interior Alaska do not belong to a narrative
concerned solely with winter travel, but her maiden voyage ended in an
unexpected and rather extraordinary journey over the ice which is
perhaps worth describing. After the voyage down the Yukon, and up and
down the Tanana, it was purposed to take the boat up the Koyukuk to the
new mission at the Allakaket, where dogs and gear had been left, and put
her in winter quarters there. The delays that associate themselves not
unnaturally with three novices and a four-cylinder gasoline engine, had
brought the date for ascending the Koyukuk a little too late for safety,
though still well within the ordinary season of open water. The
possibility of an early winter closing the navigation of that stream
before the _Pelican_ reached her destination had been entertained and
provided against, though it seemed remote. Three dogs, needed anyway to
replace superannuated members of the team, had been bargained for at
Tanana and accommodations for them arranged, and a supply of dog fish
stowed on the after deck of the launch. But when we went to pay the
arranged price and receive the dogs, the vender's wife and children set
up such a remonstrance and plaintive to-do that he went back on his
bargain and we did not get the dogs. There was no time to hunt others,
to linger was to invite the very mishap we sought to guard against, so
we pulled out dogless, reached the mouth of the Koyukuk on the 17th of
September and, having taken on board the supply of gasoline cached
there, turned our bow up the river the next morning. For five days we
pushed up the waters of that great, lonely river, and by that time we
were some twenty-five miles above Hogatzakaket, three hundred and
twenty-five miles from the mouth and one hundred and twenty-five miles
from the mission, at the camp of a prospector who had recently poled up
from the Yukon. We woke on board the launch the next morning to find ice
formed all around us and ice running in the river. The thermometer had
gone to zero in the night.

[Sidenote: THE RUNNING ICE]

A very brief attempt to make our way against the running ice showed the
danger of doing so, for the thin cakes had knife-edges and cut the
planking of the boat so that she began to leak. Then there came to me
with some bitterness that I had earnestly desired a thin steel
armour-plating at the water-line, but had allowed myself to be persuaded
out of it by her builders. So again my forethought had been of no
avail--though, of course, lightness of draught _was_ the first
consideration. We put back to the camp and proceeded to flatten out and
cut up all the empty cans and tinware we could find and nail it along
the water-line of the boat, but the prospector persuaded us to wait a
day or two. He had never seen a river close with the first little run of
ice. He looked for a soft spell and open water yet. It was foolish to
risk the boat against the ice. So we waited; and night after night the
thermometer fell a little lower and a little lower, until presently a
sheet of ice stretched across the whole river in the bend where we lay.
We were frozen in. The remote possibility we had feared and sought to
guard against had happened. Navigation had ceased on the Koyukuk at the
earliest date anybody remembered, the 23d of September. Three days more
had surely taken us to the mission where they had long expected us; now
we should have to make our way on foot, without dogs, on the dangerous
"first ice," as it is called, taking all sorts of chances, pulling a
Yukon sled, with tent and stove, grub and bedding, "by the back of the
face."

But first there was the launch to pull out and make snug for the winter
and safe against the spring break-up. A convenient little creek mouth
with easy grade offered, which was one of the reasons I had not pushed
on the few more miles we could have made. Here were eligible winter
quarters; farther on we might have trouble in putting the boat in
safety; here also was a kindly and capable man willing to assist us.

It was our great good fortune to find this man at this spot. A steamboat
he had signalled as she entered the mouth of the Koyukuk had passed him
by unheeded, and he had been left to make his way six hundred miles up
to the diggings, with his winter's outfit in a poling boat. He had
accomplished more than half the task, and, warned by the approach of
winter, had stopped at this place a few days before we reached it, and
had begun the building of a little cabin; meaning to prospect the creek,
which had taken his eye as having a promising look. The cabin we helped
him finish was the twenty-first cabin he had built in Alaska, he
informed us.

There is something very impressive about the quiet, self-reliant,
unrecorded hardihood of the class of which this man was an excellent
type. We asked him why he had no partner, and he said he had had several
partners, but they all snored, and he would not live with a man that
snored. He had prospected and mined in many districts of Alaska during
nearly twenty years. Once he had sold a claim for a few hundred dollars
that had yielded many thousands to the purchaser, and that was as near
wealth as he had ever come. But he had always made a living, always had
enough money at the close of the summer to buy his winter's "outfit" and
try his luck somewhere else.

[Sidenote: THE PROSPECTOR]

Singly, or in pairs, men of this type have wandered all over this vast
country: preceding the government surveys, preceding the professional
explorer, settling down for a winter on some creek that caught their
fancy, building a cabin, thawing down a few holes to bed-rock, sometimes
taking out a little gold, more often finding nothing, going in the
summer to some old-established camp to work for wages, or finding
employment as deck-hand on a steamboat.

With an axe and an auger they have dotted their rough habitations all
over the country; with a pick and a shovel and a gold pan they have
tested the gravels of innumerable creeks. They know the drainage slopes
and the practicable mountain passes, the haunts of the moose and the
time and direction of the caribou's wanderings. The boats they have
built have pushed their noses to the heads of all navigable streams; the
sleds they have made have furrowed the remotest snows. In the arts of
the wilderness they are the equal of the native inhabitant; in endurance
and enterprise far his superior. The more one learns by experience and
observation what life of this sort means, and realises the demands it
makes upon a man's resourcefulness, upon his physique, upon his good
spirits, upon his fortitude, the more one's admiration grows for the
silent, strong men who have gone out all over this land and pitted
themselves successfully against its savage wildness. Often in stress for
the necessaries of life, there are yet no men as a class more
free-handed and generous; trained to do everything for themselves, there
are none more willing to help others.

It is no small task to pull a four-ton boat out of the water with only
such wilderness tackle as we could devise. We made ways of soft timbers,
squaring and smoothing them; we cut down many trees for rollers; we dug
and graded the beach. Then, having altogether unloaded her and built a
high cache of poles and a platform for her stuff, and having chopped the
ice from all around her, we rigged a Spanish windlass and wound that
boat out of the water with the half-inch cable she carried, and up on
the ways and well into the mouth of the little creek. Then we levelled
her up and thoroughly braced her and put her canvas cover all over her,
and she lay there until spring and took no harm at all.

Arthur had meantime been making a sled of birch, intending to pull it
himself while the doctor and I pulled a Yukon sled borrowed from our
friend the prospector. By the 6th of October all our dispositions were
made for departure, and the ice seemed strong enough to warrant trusting
ourselves to it; but we waited another two days, the thermometer still
reaching a minimum each night somewhere around zero. When we said
good-bye to our friend Martin Nelson (sometimes one wonders if anywhere
else in the world can be found men as kind and helpful to strangers) and
started on our journey, it soon appeared that Arthur's sled was more
hindrance than help. There was no material to iron the runners save
strips of tin can, and these could not be beaten so smooth that they did
not drag and cut on the ice. So the load was transferred to our sled and
the little sled abandoned, and we took turns at the harness. This was
the order of the journey: one man went ahead with an axe to test the
ice; one man put the rope trace about his shoulders; one man pushed at
the handle-bars which had been affixed to the sled. It was fortunate
that amidst the equipment on the launch were two pairs of ice-creepers.
Without them any sort of pulling and pushing on the glare ice would have
been impossible.

We soon found that the bend in which we had frozen was no sort of index
of the general condition of the river. Much of it was still wide open,
and every elbow between bends was piled high with rough ice from
pressure jams. There was shore ice, however, even in the open bends,
along which we were able to creep; and, though the ice-jams gave
considerable trouble, yet we did very well the first day and camped at
dark with eighteen or nineteen miles to our credit, in the presence of a
great, red, smoky sunset and a glorious alpenglow on a distant snow
mountain.

The next day was full of risks and difficulties. We were to learn more
about the varieties and vagaries of ice on that journey than many
winters' travel on older ice would teach.

[Illustration: THE START OVER THE "FIRST ICE."]

[Illustration: "ROUGH GOING."]

[Sidenote: THE START]

At times, for a few hundred yards, the sled would glide with little
effort over smooth, polished ice; then would come a long sand-bar, the
side of which we had to hug close, and the ice upon it was what is
called "shell-ice," through several layers of which we broke at every
step. As the river fell, each night had left a thin sheet of ice
underneath the preceding night's ice, and the foot crashed through the
layers and the sled runners cut through them down to the gravel and sand
at the bottom. Then would come another smooth stretch on which we made
good time. But as we advanced up the river the current was swifter and
swifter and the ice conditions grew steadily worse. Here was a steep-cut
bank with just about eighteen or twenty inches of ice adhering to it and
the black, rushing water beyond. We must either get our load along that
shelf or unload the sled and pack everything over the face of a rocky
bluff. Arthur passed over it first, testing gently with the axe, and
found it none too strong. But the alternative was so toilsome that we
resolved to take the chance. The doctor put the trace over his
shoulders, Arthur took the handle-bars, while I climbed to a ledge of
the rocks and, with a rope made of a pair of camel's-hair puttees
unwound for the purpose and fastened to the sled, took all the weight I
could and eased the sled over the worst place where the ice sloped to
the water. If the ice had broken I might have held the sled from sinking
until one of the others came to me, or I might not; the boys would
probably have gone in too. It was a most risky spot and the sort of
chance no one would think of taking under ordinary circumstances. As it
was, the ice broke under Arthur's feet, and only by throwing his weight
on the sled did he save himself a ducking. But we got the load safely
across.

A good run of perhaps a mile, and then we had to go back at least half a
mile, for the ice played out altogether on our side of the river as we
reached the Batzakaket, and there was open water in the middle. To reach
the shore ice that was continuous on the other side, we had to "double"
the open water. With such varying fortune the day passed, and we camped
on the level ice of a little creek tributary to the right bank, having
made perhaps another nineteen miles.

When I awoke in the morning my heart sank at the tiny, creeping patter
of fine snow on the silk tent. Snow was one thing I greatly dreaded, for
there was not a pair of snow-shoes amongst us! A little snow would not
do much harm, but if once snow began to fall we might have a foot or two
before it ceased, and then we should be in bad case. It stopped before
noon, but the half-inch that fell made the sled drag much heavier. The
actual force to be exerted was not the most laborious feature of pulling
that sled; it was the jerk, jerk, jerk on the shoulders. A dog's four
legs give him much smoother traction than a man's two legs give, just as
a four-cylinder engine will turn a propeller with much less vibration
than a two-cylinder engine. Every step forward gave an impulse that
spent itself before the next impulse was given, and the result was that
the shoulders grew sore.

We came that morning to the longest and roughest ice-jam we had so far
encountered. It was as though a thousand bulls had been turned loose in
a mammoth plate-glass warehouse. Jagged slabs of ice upended everywhere
in the most riotous confusion, and it was impossible to pick any way
amongst them, so a man had to go ahead and hew a path. It was while thus
engaged that the doctor fell and injured his knee so severely on a sharp
ice point that he hobbled in pain the rest of the trip. This was a very
serious matter to us, for, though he insisted on still taking his trick
at the traces, his effectiveness as a motive power was much diminished;
and we had no sooner thus hewed and smashed our way through that jam
than we had to hew and smash it across to the other side again in our
search for passage.

[Sidenote: "BY THE BACK OF THE FACE"]

Then we came to a place where, in order to cut off a long sweeping curve
of the river with open water and bad shore ice, we went through a dry
slough and had to drag those iron runners over gravel and stones, where
sometimes it was all the three of us could do to move the sled a few
feet at a time. Yet all along the banks were willows, and if we had only
known then what we know now we would have cut down and split some
saplings and bound them over the iron, and so have saved three fourths
of that labour.

[Sidenote: BEAR MEAT AND BEANS]

So the day's run was short, though the most exhausting yet, and we were
all thoroughly tired out when we pitched the tent. I have note of a
great supper of bear meat and beans, the meat the spoil of our friend
the prospector's gun. It is one of the compensations of human nature
that the satisfaction of appetite increases in pleasure in proportion to
the bodily labour that is done. With food abundant and at choice, I do
not like bear meat and will not eat beans. Yet my diary bears special
note of the delicious meal they furnished on this occasion. Put any
philosopher in the traces, or set him ahead of the dog team on
show-shoes, breaking trail all day, and towards evening it is odds that
his mind is not occupied with deep speculations about the infinite and
the absolute, but rather with the question of what he will have for
supper. Particularly should the grub be a little short, should fresh
meat give out, or, above all, should sugar be "shy," it is astonishing
how one's mind runs on eating and what elaborate imaginary repasts one
partakes of. Yet of all food that a man ever eats there is none that is
so relished and gives such clear gustatory pleasure as the plain, rough
fare of the camp--provided it be well cooked. Greatly as we were in need
of sleep, we got little, for the doctor's knee pained him all night and
poor Arthur developed a raging toothache that did not yield until
carbolic acid had been thrice applied.

Soon after we started the next day, the river narrowed and swept round a
series of mountain bluffs and we began to have the gloomiest
expectations of trouble. It seemed certain that ice would fail us for
passage, and we would have to pack our sled and its load by slow relays
over the mountain. But to our delight we passed between the bluffs on
good, firm, smooth ice, and it was not until we emerged on the flat
beyond that our difficulty began. So it is again and again on the trail.
Almost always it is the unexpected that happens; almost always it is
something quite different from what our apprehensions have dwelt upon
that arises to hinder and distress us. A tongue of level land that
struck far out into the water, a cut mud bank with a current so swift
that no ice at all had formed along it, interposed an obstacle that it
took hours to circumvent. We had to leave the sled and cut a trail
through the brush for half a mile along this peninsula in order to reach
a stretch of the river where the ice was resumed, and the little snow
that had fallen being quite insufficient to give the sled good passage,
we had an exceedingly arduous job in getting it across.

A mile or two of good going brought us in view of the smoke of a human
habitation. What a blessed sight often and often this waving column of
blue smoke in the distance is! Sometimes it means life itself to the
Alaskan musher, and it always means warmth, shelter, food,
companionship, assistance; all that one human being can bring to
another. "The bright and the balmy effulgence of morn" never "breaks on
the traveller faint and astray" with half the rejoicing that comes with
the first sight of mere smoke. "I believe I see smoke," cried Arthur,
with the quick vision of the native. "Where? Where?" we eagerly
inquired, and the doctor left the handle-bars and limped forward to the
boy ahead with the axe. "Away yonder on that bank," pointed Arthur. "I
see it! I see it!" the doctor shouted; "we're coming to a house, we're
coming to people!" The trip was a severe apprenticeship to Alaskan life
for a man straight from the New York hospitals, although before the
accident to his knee I had declared that if only they could be trained
to live on dry fish I thought a team of young doctors would haul a sled
very well. He was delighted at coming upon the first inhabited house we
had seen since we helped Nelson to build his little cabin--and _that_
was only the second inhabited house in three hundred miles.

[Sidenote: BREAKING THROUGH]

But, perhaps because we grew less cautious in our excitement, almost
immediately after we had spied the smoke of the cabin we got into one of
the worst messes of the whole trip. Arthur had pushed ahead and we had
followed with a spurt, and almost at the same time all three of us
became aware that we were on dangerous ice. Arthur cried, "The ice is
breaking; go back!" just as we began to feel it swaying under our feet.
I shouted to the doctor, "Go _on_ to the bank quick!" and pushed with
all my might, and we managed to make a few yards more towards shallow
water, over ice that bent and cracked at every step, before it gave way
and let down the sled and the men into two feet of water. Arthur had run
safely over the breaking ice and had gained the bank, and as I write, in
my mind's eye I can see the doctor, who had been duly instructed in the
elementary lessons of the trail, standing in the water and calling to
Arthur: "Make a fire quick; make a fire. I'm all wet!"

But it was not necessary to make a fire, for the thermometer was no
lower than 10° or 15° above zero, and the chief trouble was not the
wetting of our legs but the wetting of the contents of the sled. Along
the bank was stronger ice, and we managed, though not without much
difficulty, to get the sled upon it and to make our way to the Indian
cabin.

As soon as old "Atler" (I have never been quite sure of what white
man's name that is a corruption) knew who we were, his hospitality,
which had been ready enough at first sight, became most cordial and
expansive. While we pulled off our wet clothing his wife hung it up to
dry and had the kettle on and some tea making, and he and Arthur got out
our wet bedding and festooned it about the cabin. Most fortunately the
things that would have suffered most from water did not get wet. So
there we lay all the afternoon, having made no more than six miles, and
there we lay all the next day, which was Sunday.

There was a sort of awful interest that centred upon one member of this
family, a boy of seven or eight years. The previous spring he had killed
his uncle by the accidental discharge of a .22 rifle, shooting him
through the heart. The gun had been brought in loaded and cocked and had
been set in a corner of the cabin, and the child, playing with it, had
pulled the trigger. The carelessness of Indians with firearms is the
frequent cause of terrible accidents like this. The child was still too
young to realise what he had done, but one fancies that later it will
throw a gloom on his life.

To my great relief and satisfaction I was able to arrange here for a
young Indian man to accompany us with his one dog. He was a native of
those parts and knew every bend and turn of the river. We were, indeed,
in great need of help. The doctor's knee grew worse rather than better,
and Arthur was suffering the return of an old rheumatism in his leg. I
was the only sound member of the party, and my shoulders were galled by
the rope and my feet tender and sore from continual wearing of the
crampons. We were now not quite half-way--some sixty miles lay behind us
and sixty-five before--and we had been travelling four days.

[Sidenote: "ONE-EYED WILLIAM"]

Divine service being done on Sunday morning, the whole of it well
interpreted by Arthur to the great satisfaction of the Indians, he and
"One-Eyed William," our recruit, started out to survey to-morrow's
route. In this reconnaissance William broke through some slush ice at
the greatest depth of the river in seeking a safe place to cross, and,
had Arthur not been with him, would almost certainly have drowned, for
the current was very swift and the man, like most Indians, unable to
swim a stroke;--though, indeed, swimming is of little avail for escape
out of such predicament and is a poor dependence in these icy waters
winter or summer. More beans boiled and a batch of biscuits baked
against our departure, and evening prayer said and interpreted, we were
ready for bed again.

Our visit was a great delight to old Atler. An inflamed eye was much
relieved by the doctor's ministrations, and the natural piety which he
shares with most Indians was gratified at the opportunity of worship and
instruction. A good old man, according to his lights, I take Atler to
be, well known for benevolence of disposition and particularly priding
himself on being a friend of the white man. He told us of one unworthy
representative of that race he had helped a year ago. The man had come
out of the Hogatzitna (Hog River) country, entirely out of food, himself
and a couple of dogs nigh to starvation, and Atler had taken care of him
for several days while he recuperated and had given him grub and dog
fish enough to get him to Bettles, one hundred and thirty miles away,
where he could purchase supplies. The old Indian had robbed his own
family's little winter stock of "white-man's grub" that this stranger
might be provided, and had never heard a word from him since, though he
had promised to make return when he reached Bettles.

Unfortunately Alaska's white population is sprinkled with men like this,
men without heart and without conscience, and it is precisely such
rascals who are loudest in their contemptuous talk of the Indians. It is
such men who chop down the woodwork of cabins rather than be troubled to
take the axe into the forest a few rods away, who depart in the morning
without making kindling and shavings, careless how other travellers may
fare so themselves be warm without labour; who make "easy money" in the
summer-time by dropping down the Yukon with a boat-load of "rot-gut"
whisky, leaving drunkenness and riot at every village they pass; who
beget children of the native women and regard them no more than a dog
does his pups, indifferent that their own flesh and blood go cold and
hungry. They are the curse and disgrace of Alaska, and they often go
long time insolent and unwhipped because our poor lame law is not nimble
enough to overtake them; "to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness
for ever," one's indignation is sometimes disposed to thunder savagely
with Saint Jude; and indeed there needs a future punishment to redress
the balance in this country.

[Sidenote: FIDO]

At break of day our reinforced company was off, Arthur and "One-Eyed
William" going ahead to sound the ice and pick the way, the dog "Fido"
(such a name for a Siwash dog!) and myself in the traces, the doctor at
the handle-bars. The rest had benefited the doctor's knee, but walking
was still painful and he needed the support of the handle-bars all day.
What a great difference that one strong, willing little dog made! His
steady pulling kept the sled in motion and relieved one's shoulders of
the galling jerk of the rope at every step. The going was "not too bad,"
as they say here, all day, though it carried one rather severe
disappointment. William had told us of a portage he thought we could
take that would cut off eight or nine miles of the river; but when we
reached it the snow upon it proved insufficient to afford a passage, for
it was a rough niggerhead flat, and we had to swing around the outer
edges of the great curves the river makes, where alone was ice, with
trouble and danger at every crossing.

The decision as to whether we should halt or go forward, as to whether
ice was safe or unsafe, as to whether we should cross the river or stay
where we were--every decision that concerned the secure advance of the
party--I put wholly upon William, and would not permit myself or any
other to question his judgment or to argue it with him. There was no
sense in half-measures; this young man knew the river as none of us did,
knew ice as none of us did, and we must put ourselves entirely in his
hands. The debate that had become usual at every doubtful course arose
at the portage just referred to, but it was at once suppressed by the
announcement that hereafter no one could have the floor but William, and
that when he had spoken the matter was settled. Day by day I think we
all came to a keener realisation of how very dangerous a journey we were
making; it lay heavily on my mind that I had brought these two young
men--whether by mishap or mismanagement--into real peril of their lives.
Again and again I blamed myself for the delays that had deferred our
start up the Koyukuk, again and again I wished that we had waited longer
before leaving the _Pelican's_ winter quarters. I had even contemplated
a week's stay at Atler's, to give the river a chance to get into better
shape, but unless there came a very much sharper spell than we had had
so far a week would not make much difference, and our grub began to run
short and Atler was none too well supplied. So it seemed best to push
on.

The next day was full of toil and difficulty. There was no good ice to
make fine time over that day. Starting in the grey dawn, for mile after
mile we had to haul the sled over crumbly shell-ice that broke through
to gravel; and when the shell-ice was done we came to a new bend where a
rapid current washed a steep mud bank. There was just a little shelf of
ice, but the brush overhung it so that the passage of the sled was not
possible. William and Arthur started with the axes to clear away the
brush, but it seemed to me foolish to do that unless the ledge held out
and led somewhere, for the turn of the bank threw it out of sight. So
they went forward cautiously along that ledge to the end--and an end
they found, sure enough, so that had we followed the axemen with the
sled we should have had to creep all the way back again. There was
nothing for it but to cut another land trail on a bench that we could
reach where the sled was stopped but that could not be reached at all
farther on. A long and slow and laborious job it was, that took most of
the morning, to cut that trail and then get the load over it to ice
again.

By noon we were opposite the Red Mountain, one of the well-known Koyukuk
landmarks, and on the site of an old Indian fishing camp. William and
Arthur had made a great fire when we came up, and we heated some beans
and made some tea and ate lunch. A mile farther on was the cabin of a
white man, and we paid him a brief visit and got a little tea from him,
for ours was nearly gone. It did me good to hear him sing the praises of
Deaconess Carter, the trained nurse at the mission. She had taken him
in, crippled with rheumatism, and had cured him. Already the new mission
was proving a boon to whites as well as natives. We made no more than
four or five miles farther when, coming to spruce with no more in sight
for a long distance, we pitched the tent, all very tired.

That night the thermometer went to 5° below zero, the coldest weather of
the season so far. As a consequence the next day we had a new and very
disagreeable trouble. The cold weather, by increasing the amount of
running ice in the still open stretches, had brought about a jam that
had raised the level of the water and caused an overflow of the ice--a
very common phenomenon of a closing river. We picked our way wet-foot
much of the day, and towards evening came to a complete _impasse_ in the
middle of the river, with open water in front and on one hand, and new
thin ice on the other. So we had to turn round and go back again a long
way, the mid-river being the only traversable place, until, when it
seemed that we should have to go round another bend to reach a crossing,
Arthur proposed that he and William, who wore mukluks, should carry the
doctor and me, who wore moccasins across the overflow, and then rush the
sled across; and this we did, wetting its contents somewhat, however. We
camped immediately, for we had landed on impassable gravel.

[Sidenote: THE RED MOUNTAIN]

That night the thermometer went to 20° below zero, and we took good hope
that the cold, which began to approach the real cold of winter, would
put an end to overflow; but, on the contrary, it only aggravated the
trouble. For the first mile or two there was nothing for it but to go
through it, and at 20° below it is a miserable business to be wading in
moccasins even for an hour. We had rearranged our load so that it stood
up somewhat higher, but we could not avoid wetting the things on the
bottom of the sled, and the ice formed about it very inconveniently.
Moreover, the little dog, who had a great dislike to wetting his feet,
began to give us a good deal of trouble, and at one time nothing but the
admirable presence of mind and prompt action of William saved us from
losing our whole load. We had reached a strip of new, dry ice formed the
night before, with black, rushing water on the left, towards which the
slippery surface sloped. Presently as we advanced we began to encounter
a little overflow water, coming from the bank on the right, seeping up
between the ice and the bank; and that dog, to avoid wetting his feet in
the overflow, deliberately turned towards the open water and set the
sled sliding in the same direction. Without the crampons, which we had
not used for the past few days, it was impossible to hold the sled
against the dog's traction, and in another moment we should have lost
everything, for the dog paid no heed to our voices, when William with a
blow of his axe cut the rope by which the dog pulled, and, grasping the
sled and throwing himself full length on the ice, managed to stop it on
the very brink of the water. It was a close shave, but once more we were
safe; and the doctor, in the exuberance of his gratitude, said that
night: "If William wants a glass eye I'll send to New York to get him
one." But when William learned that the glass eye was a mere matter of
looks and would in no wise improve his vision, he lost interest in it.
Looks do not count for much amongst the Koyukuk Indians.

[Illustration: ARTHUR AND DOCTOR BURKE.]

[Illustration: SAINT JOHN'S-IN-THE-WILDERNESS, ALLAKAKET, KOYUKUK
RIVER.]

That night was a long way off yet, however; we had other risks to run,
other labours. Here were two islands in the river, and the current,
running like a mill-race and burdened with ice cakes, swept around the
shore of one of them leaving the passage between them quite dry. There
was no shore ice at all where the channel was, and it was so
ugly-looking a reach that had there been any there I am sure we should
not have ventured it. There was nothing for it but to drag the sled half
a mile over the gravel, and we did it, the most heart-breaking labour
of the whole trip. It took us exactly an hour to make that half mile.
William did not know the trick of the split willows either, so we all
four of us sweated for our ignorance. Shortly after, our guide pointed
out the spot where poor Ericson's frozen body was found, two years and
eight months before.

[Sidenote: A NARROW ESCAPE]

[Sidenote: RUBBER ICE]

Near the Kornuchaket (or the mouth of Old Man Creek), where the Koyukuk
receives a considerable tributary, we approached the most dangerous
travelling we had had yet. The river here is swift and deep, and there
are several islands set in it. Most of its surface was frozen, but the
ice was very thin. William stopped the procession before we reached the
bad stretch and went hastily over a part of it. Under his single weight
we could see the ice-sheet undulating. It had been our rule that ice was
not safe unless it took three blows of the axe to bring water, but this
ice gave water at a blow. When William returned he made quite an
harangue, which Arthur interpreted. He thought we could make it past the
mouth of the creek, and if we could we should find good going to Moses'
Village. But we must go just as fast as we could travel; we must not let
the sled stop an instant. The ice would bend and crack; but he thought
if we went quickly we could get across. So for nearly a quarter of a
mile we rushed that sled over "rubber" ice that swayed and cracked and
yielded under our feet and under the sled, until we reached the bank of
one of the islands, and then again we launched her and ran with her to
the shore. Once one of my feet broke through, and immediately the water
welled up all around--with the steamboat channel underneath--but
without pause we increased our speed and made the strong shore ice
safely at last. No man will ever doubt the plasticity, the "viscosity"
of ice, as it used to be styled in the old glacier controversies, who
has passed over the "rubber" ice that forms under certain circumstances
and at certain seasons on these rivers.

We would never, I am sure, have attempted that ice had not William been
with us. We would have struck a blow with the axe and declared it
unsafe. Of course, it was unsafe; the whole journey was unsafe, but I am
convinced that this thin, continuous sheet of ice, cushioned actually
upon the surface of the water out of which it was growing, was really
safer than much of the thicker but brittle, unsupported ice we had
unhesitatingly come over. Chemists tell us that certain substances in
the act of formation, which they call nascent substances, are
extraordinarily active and potent, and it may be that ice in the same
state has a special tenacity of texture which belongs to that state
alone. I wish that I could have measured the thickness of that ice.
Where my foot went through I know it was very thin, but its thickness I
will not venture to guess. There was the distinct feeling that the water
was bearing the ice up and when it was punctured the water welled up
with pressure behind it.

Beyond the Kornuchaket much more snow had fallen, and a few miles
brought us to Moses' Village, called grandiosely "Arctic City," since a
trader had established a store and a road-house there. At this spot a
new overland mail trail from Tanana strikes the Koyukuk, and, although
ten or twelve miles remained, we felt that our journey was done. My sled
dogs were there, and, as I had not seen them for more than a year, that
was a joyful reunion. Nanook's bark of welcome, which no one but I ever
got with quite the same inflection, was as grateful to me as all the
licking and slobbering of the others, for Nanook is a very independent
beast, reserved in his demonstrations and not wearing his heart on his
sleeve, so to speak. They were all glad to see me--Old Lingo and Nig,
and even "Jimmy the Fake." Billy was dead. For fifteen or sixteen months
they had been boarded here, and, since fish had been very scarce the
preceding summer, their food had been chiefly bacon and rice and tallow,
and there was a bill of close to four hundred dollars against us! Dogs
are very expensive things in this expensive country. When used the
winter through on the trail, and boarded the summer through at a fish
camp, we estimate that it costs one hundred dollars per head per annum
to feed a dog; so that the maintenance of a team of five dogs, which is
the minimum practicable team, will cost five hundred dollars per annum
for food alone.

[Sidenote: SATURATED SNOW]

When we had eaten a good supper and were reclining on spring cots in the
bunk house, there was not one of us but confidently expected to be at
the mission in the next forenoon. For a week past the natives had been
going to and fro in three or four hours. The river was completely closed
above here, and there was much more snow than we found below. So we
hitched our own dogs to our own sled the next morning, when the doctor
had visited a sick person or two, and started out on the last stretch
of the journey. All went well until we had turned the long bend at the
head of which the old, abandoned post of Bergman is situated, just on
the Arctic Circle, but a mile or two beyond we were wallowing in
saturated snow that stretched all across the river right up to the banks
on either side. An overflow was in progress, the water running along the
surface of the ice and soaking up the snow so that there was six inches
of slush all over it. We struggled along awhile, though from the first
it seemed hopeless, and then we gave it up and went back to the
road-house. There would be no passing that stretch of river with the
sled until the cold had dealt with the overflow. It is almost always the
unexpected that happens. The next morning I put on a pair of
snow-shoes--Doctor Burke's knee forbade him their use--and taking
William with me, mushed up through the slush and the snow to the
mission, leaving the others to come on with the team so soon as they
found it practicable.

A mile before we reached the mission was the new village built by the
Esquimaux--"Kobuk town" they call it--and right in front of the village
the Malamute Riffle, a noted difficulty of navigation, was still running
wide open, though all the rest of the river was long closed. Near the
riffle the Kobuks had a fish-trap, and some who were busy getting out
fish saw and recognised me, and the whole population came swarming out
for greetings. It was good to see these kindly, simple people again, to
shake their hands and hear their "I glad I see you," which is the
general native greeting where there is any English at all. Every one
must shake hands; even the babies on their mothers' backs stretch out
their little fingers eagerly, and if they be too small for that, the
mother will take the little hand and hold it out. At the bend we take a
portage and a quarter of a mile brings us to the Allakaket, to the
familiar modest buildings of the mission, with its new Koyukuk village
gradually clustering round it. The whole scene was growing into almost
the exact realisation of my dream when first I camped on this spot two
years and nine months before. There was a distinct thrill of pleasure at
the sight of the church. Built entirely of logs with the bark on, there
was nothing visible anywhere about it but spruce bark, save for the
gleam of the gilded cross that surmounted the little belfry. The roof,
its regular construction finished, was covered with small spruce poles
with the bark on, nailed together at the apex, and where it projected
well beyond the gables its under-side was covered with bark, as well as
the cornice all round that finished it off. Even the window-frames and
the door-panels were covered with bark. It was of the same tone because
of the selfsame substance as the forest still growing around it, and it
gave at the first glance the satisfied impression of fitness. It gave
the feeling that it belonged where it was placed. It is ill praising
one's own work, but I had been keen to see how it would strike me, fresh
from the outside, after a year's absence, and I was very glad indeed
that it pleased me again.

[Sidenote: A STARVING WHITE MAN]

I had no more than entered upon the warm welcome that waited at Saint
John's-in-the-Wilderness, and was still wondering at the homelike
cosiness which the mission house had assumed under the deft hands of
the two ladies who occupied it, when there came an Indian with word of a
white man he had found starving in the wilderness fifteen miles away.
Another native with a dog team and a supply of immediate food was
hastily despatched to bring the man in, and that night the poor
emaciated fellow, looking like a man of sixty-five or seventy though he
was really no more than forty, crawled out of the sled and tottered into
the house. He had started out from Tanana two months before with two
pack-horses to make his way across to the Koyukuk diggings, had lost his
way and wandered aimlessly in that vast wilderness; one horse had been
drowned, the other he had killed for meat. He had made a raft to come
down the Kornutna (Old Man Creek) to the Koyukuk, knowing that there was
a trading-post near its mouth, and had been frozen in and forced to
abandon it. Since that time he had been living on a few spoonfuls of
meal a day, with frozen berries, and once or twice a ptarmigan, and when
Ned found him was at the last extremity and had given up, intending to
die where he was.

That man's hunger was tremendous, but Miss Carter, having knowledge and
experience of such cases, was apprehensive that if any large quantity of
food were taken at a time there would be serious danger to him. So for a
day or two he ate frequently but sparingly. A little later, as he grew
stronger, to such extremes did his hunger pinch him that he would watch
till there was no one looking and would go into the kitchen and steal
food that was preparing, even taking it out of the frying-pan on the
stove. He would be hungry immediately after having a full meal. In ten
days he was sufficiently recovered to resume his journey to the
diggings, and when I saw him at Coldfoot two months later I did not
recognise him, so greatly had he changed from the poor shrunken creature
that crept into the mission. We all think we have been hungry time and
again; if ever we have gone a few days on short rations we are quite
sure of it; this man had sounded the height and depth and stretched the
length and breadth of it, and none of the rest of us really know what
hunger means. I tried to get him to talk about it, but he said he wanted
to forget it. He said he was ashamed to think of some of the things he
had done and of some of the terrible thoughts that had come to him, and
I pressed him no more. I have always felt that, even in its last
hideousness of cannibalism, only God Himself can judge starvation.

[Sidenote: TWO INTERPRETERS]

Here began my first experience of the difficulties of conducting a
mission at the same place for two different races of natives speaking
totally different languages. Although the Indian language spoken here is
the same as at Tanana, and much of the liturgy, etc., had been put into
that tongue by Mr. Prevost and was therefore available, yet it was found
impracticable to have two sets of services whenever the church was used,
for both races would always attend anyway. Since the mastery of the two
tongues was out of the question, and there were no translations at all
into the Esquimau, it became a question of teaching the Esquimaux to
take part in an Indian service or dropping both vernaculars altogether
and conducting the service in English. After much doubt and experiment
the latter was resolved upon, and the whole service of prayer and praise
is in English. When the lessons are read and the address delivered it is
necessary to use two interpreters; the minister delivers his sentence in
English, then the Koyukuk interpreter puts it in Indian, and when he is
done the Esquimau interpreter puts it into that tongue.

It is a very tedious business, this double interpretation and a
twenty-minute sermon takes fully an hour to deliver, but there is no
help for it. The singing is hearty and enthusiastic though the repertory
is wisely very limited; and here, north of the Arctic Circle, is a
vested choir of eight or ten Kobuk and Koyukuk boys who lead the singing
and lead it very well.

Already the influence of the mission and the school was very marked.
Given the native off by himself like this, in the hands of those in whom
he has learned to place entire confidence, remote from debasing
agencies, and his improvement is evident and his survival assured.

[Illustration: THE DOUBLE INTERPRETATION AT THE ALLAKAKET.]

[Illustration: THE WIND-SWEPT YUKON WITHIN THE RAMPARTS.]

In two days the doctor and Arthur and the team came up, and so was
brought to a happy conclusion a perilous journey over the first ice. One
is often glad to have had experiences that one would by no means repeat,
and this is a case in point. We had learned a good deal about ice; we
had taken liberties with ice that none of us had ever thought before
could be taken with impunity; we had learned to trust ice and at the
same time to distrust it and in some measure to discriminate about it.
The "last ice" is bad, but the "first ice" is much worse, and all
three of us were agreed that we wanted no more travelling over it and no
more pulling of a sled "by the back of the face."

Then followed a very happy, busy time of several weeks while the river
ice was consolidating and the land trails establishing; happy with its
manifold evidences of the rapid advance the natives were making under
Miss Carter's able and beneficent sway, busy with the instruction of
people eager to learn. It was busy and happy for Doctor Burke also; busy
with the many ailments he relieved, happy with the beginnings of an
attachment which two years later culminated in his marriage to Miss
Carter's colleague at this mission.




CHAPTER VII

THE KOYUKUK TO THE YUKON AND TO TANANA--CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS AT SAINT
JOHN'S-IN-THE-WILDERNESS


LEAVING Fort Yukon on the 26th of November, 1909, and going again over
almost the same route we followed during the first journey described in
this volume, we reached the new mission at the Allakaket on the Koyukuk
River on the 14th of December, after a period of almost continual cold.
The climate of the interior of Alaska varies as much as any climate. The
previous year, continuing the journey described in "The First Ice," I
had passed over this same route in the opposite direction, between the
same dates, with the thermometer well above zero the whole time. This
trip the _mean_ of the minimum reading at night, the noon reading, and
the reading at start and finish of each day's journey was -38 1/4°. Many
days in that three weeks we travelled all day at 45° and 50° below zero,
and we spent one night in camp at 49° below.

It was the beginning of a severe winter, with much snow north of the
Yukon and long periods of great cold.

[Sidenote: BIRTH, BURIAL, AND DANCING]

The two weeks or so spent at the mission of Saint
John's-in-the-Wilderness was enjoyed as only a rest is enjoyed after
making such a journey; as only Christmas is enjoyed at such a native
mission. It is the time of the whole year for the people; they come in
from near and far intent upon the festival in both of its aspects,
religious and social, and they enter so heartily into all that is
provided for them that one does not know which to admire most, their
simple, earnest piety or the whole-hearted enthusiasm of their sports
and pastimes. Right out of church they go to the frozen river, old men
and maidens, young men and matrons, mothers with babies on their backs
and their skirts tucked up, and they quickly line up and are kicking the
football stuffed with moose hair and covered with moose hide in the
native game that their forefathers played ages before "Rugby" was
invented.[B] When the church-bell rings, back they all troop again, to
take their places and listen patiently and reverently to the long,
double-interpreted service, the babies still on their mothers' backs,
sometimes asleep, sometimes waking up and crying, comforted by slinging
them round and applying their lips to the fountain of nourishment and
solace.

On the nights when there is no church service there is feasting and
dancing. The native dance is a very simple affair, entirely without any
objectionable feature, and one cannot see any reason in the world for
attempting to suppress it. A man and a woman get out in the middle of
the floor and dance opposite one another without touching at all. The
moccasined toes of an expert man in this dance move with surprising
rapidity, the woman, with eyes downcast, the picture of demureness,
sways slightly from side to side and moves on her toes in rhythm to the
man's movement. Presently another man jumps up and the first man yields
his place; then another woman comes forward and the first woman yields
her place, and so the dance goes on.

For a variety, of late years there is an occasional "white-man's dance,"
of the quadrille or the waltz kind, but the natives much prefer their
own dancing. Here at the Allakaket the presence of the Esquimaux adds
picturesqueness and strangeness, and the Esquimau dance, which consists
of a series of jerky attitudinisings, with every muscle tense, to a
curious monotonous chant and the beating of a drum, is a never-failing
source of amusement to the Indians.

An old man's funeral in the morning away up on the high bluff
overlooking the mission, a birth in the evening, a dance the same
night--so goes the drama of life in this little, isolated native world.
So soon as these people make up their minds that one of their number is
sick unto death they make the coffin, for when trees must be felled and
lumber whipsawed from them, it is well to be forehanded.

[Sidenote: "BEFORE" AND "AFTER"]

There is one old woman living up there yet whose coffin had been made
three times. When it becomes evident that the unfavourable prognosis was
mistaken the coffin is torn apart and made into shelves or some other
article of household utility. It seems very cold-blooded, but it is easy
to misjudge these people. The emotion of grief is real with them, I
believe, but transient. They are matter-of-fact and entirely devoid of
pretence, and when once a funeral has taken place and the service is
all over they dismiss the gloomy event from their minds as soon as
possible. The night of old Mesuk's death, however, there were fires
lighted on all the trails and before most of the Esquimau cabins, the
object of which was probably to frighten the spirit away from the
dwellings of the living. We shall get the better of these superstitions
by and by, but superstitions die hard, not only amongst Esquimaux.
Moreover, practices like this linger as traditional practices long after
their superstitious content is dissipated, and men of feeling do not
wantonly lay hands on ancient traditional custom. I think that if I were
an Esquimau and knew that from immemorial antiquity fires had been
lighted on the trails and outside the doors upon the death of my
ancestors, I should be tempted to kindle them myself upon an occasion,
however firmly I held the Communion of Saints and the Safe Repose of the
Blessed. And I am quite sure that if I were a Thlinket I should set up a
totem-pole despite all the missionaries in the world. When one comes to
think about it dispassionately, there is really nothing in Christianity
averse to the kindling of corpse fires or the blazoning of native
heraldry. When all the little superstitions and peculiar picturesque
customs are abolished out of the world it will be a much less
interesting world than it is to-day. If there were any evidence or
reason to believe that morality and religion will be furthered by the
brow-beating or cajoling of the little peoples into a close similitude
of the white race in dress and manners and customs, all other
considerations would, of course, be swallowed up in a glad welcome of
such advance. But almost the exact opposite is true. The young Indian or
Esquimau, who by much mixing with white men has been "wised up," as the
expressive phrase goes here, is commonly one of the least useful, the
least attractive, the least moral of his kind. We have many such on the
Yukon--young men who work on the steamboats in the summer and do odd
jobs and hang around the stores in winter, and will not condescend to
fish any more or to hunt or trap unless driven by the pinch of hunger.
Show me an Indian who affects the white man in garb, in speech, in
general habits, and external characteristics, and it will be easy to
show an Indian whose death would be little loss to his community or his
race; while the native woman who aspires to dress herself like a white
woman has very commonly the purpose of attracting the attention of the
white men. I think the young Indian man I recall as the best dressed,
most debonair, and most completely "civilised," was living in idleness
upon the bounty of the white trader whom every one knew to be his wife's
paramour, and was impudently careless of the general knowledge.

Of all the photographs that illustrate missionary publications--and I
have contributed enough villainous half-tones to warrant me in a
criticism--the ones I dislike most are of the "Before and After" type.
Here is a group of savages clad in skins, or furs, or feathers, or palm
fibre, or some patient, skilful weave of native wool or grass; in each
case clad congruously with their environment and out of the products it
affords. Set against it is the same or a similar group clad out of the
slop-shop, clad in hickory shirts and blue-jean trousers, clad so that,
if faces could be changed as easily as clothing, they would pass for any
commonplace group of whites anywhere. And, as if such change were in
itself the symbol and guarantee of a change from all that is brutal and
idolatrous to all that is gentle and Christian, there follows the
triumphant "Before and After" inscription. All the fitness has gone, all
the individuality, all the clever adaptation of indigenous material, all
the artistic and human interest; and a self-conscious smirk of
superiority radiates over made-by-the-million factory garments instead.
Whenever I see such contrasting photographs there comes over me a
shamed, perverse recollection of a pair of engravings by Hogarth,
usually suppressed, which a London bookseller once pulled out of a
portfolio in the back room of his shop and showed me. They bore the same
title.

I profess myself a friend of the native tongue because it is the native
tongue--the easy, familiar, natural vehicle of expression; of the native
dress because it is almost always comfortable and comely; of the native
customs, whenever they are not unhealthy or demoralising, because they
are the distinctive heritage of a people; and again, of tongue, dress,
and customs alike, if you will, simply because they are dissimilar.

[Sidenote: A BARREN UNIFORMITY]

For it has always seemed a trumpery notion that uniformity in these
things has any connection with the upbuilding of a people, has any
ethical relation at all, and I have always wondered that so trumpery a
notion should have so wide an influence. Moreover, is it not a little
curious that, whereas the trend of biological evolution on its upward
course, as Spencer assures us, is towards differentiation and
dissimilarity, the trend of sociological evolution should be so marked
towards this bald and barren uniformity? But these be deep matters.

I have never been able to join in the reproach of superciliousness so
often applied to the lines of that noblest of missionary hymns in which
Bishop Heber asks, "Can we, whose souls are lighted with wisdom from on
high, Can we, to men benighted, the lamp of life deny?" If that be
superciliousness, it is an essential superciliousness of Christianity
itself, for the question lies at the very core of our religion and will
not cease to be asked so long as the world contains those who believe
with all their hearts, and those who do not believe because they have
not heard. I never listen to that hymn without emotion, it can still
"shake me like a cry Of trumpets going by." But the question that seems
to stir the souls of some missionaries and most school-teachers, "Can we
deny to these unfortunate heathen our millinery, our 'Old Oaken Bucket,'
our Mr. and our Mrs.," leaves me quite cold.

Here was the weekly afternoon routine at this mission, only the mornings
being devoted to books and classes: On Monday the children brought their
soiled clothes of the week to the schoolroom and washed them; on Tuesday
they were dried and ironed; on Wednesday they were mended; on Thursday a
juvenile "society" did some sort of work for another mission; on Friday
every child in the village had a hot bath. Now, let a routine of that
sort be kept up, week after week, month after month, year after year,
during the whole school life of a child, and it is bound to leave its
mark; and there is no other way in which the same mark may be made.

At the Allakaket is fine example of what, I think, is the best rule in
the world for the inferior races--the absolute rule of a devoted,
intelligent, capable gentlewoman. We are but now writing the indentures
of their apprenticeship to self-government in the elective village
councils we have set up; it is good for them to serve it under this
loving and unquestioned despotism.

[Sidenote: MATTERS METEOROLOGICAL]

During all that Christmas season the temperature was subject to such
violent fluctuations that a chart of them would look like the picture
showing the comparative heights of mountains, that used to be presented
under "The World in Hemispheres" in the school geographies. A minimum of
52° below zero and a maximum of 10° below, was followed by a minimum of
53° below and a maximum of 18° below, and that by a minimum of 56° below
and a maximum of 14° below, while on Christmas Day itself we registered
a minimum of 58° below zero and a maximum of 1° above, a range of 59° in
less than twelve hours. At a time of the year when the sun has scarcely
any effect upon the temperature such tremendous changes point to
corresponding atmospheric disturbances, and each rise was caused by the
irruption of clouds upon a clear sky and was followed by a fall of snow.

It is a beautifully simple process. Driven into these regions by some
compelling current of the upper atmosphere comes a mass of warm air
laden with moisture--a cloud. As it comes in contact with the cold air
of the region it parts with its heat, and the temperature of the lower
air rises. Having parted with its heat, it can no longer contain its
moisture; and, having parted with its moisture, it ceases to exist. The
cold of the earth and of its immediate air envelope has seized upon that
cloud and devoured it, and the cold resumes its sway. So have I opened
the door of a crowded cabin, when an Indian dance or other gathering was
in progress, at 50° or 60° below zero, and the cold, dry air meeting the
hot, moist air has caused an immediate fall of snow on the threshold.

After the abrupt rise in temperature on Christmas Day, the snow began to
fall heavily, with a barometer continually falling until it reached
27.98 inches, the lowest point recorded here (at an elevation of about
500 feet above the sea) in two years and a half--and before the snow
ceased three feet had fallen.

Our winter itinerary called us to leave the Allakaket immediately after
New Year's Day, and our route lay overland through a totally uninhabited
country for nearly one hundred and fifty miles, to Tanana on the Yukon.
We knew that it would not greatly interfere with our plans to lie
another week at the Allakaket, and that would bring our departure after
the monthly journey of the mail-carrier and would thus compel him to
break trail for us through all that snow. That is the way the
mail-carriers in Alaska are usually treated, but Arthur and I took some
pride in keeping as closely as possible to the announced dates of
visitation and in doing such share of trail breaking as fell to us.

[Sidenote: TRAIL BREAKING]

So on Monday, the 3d of January, 1910, we bade farewell to Deaconess
Carter and her colleague and to the native charges they rule and care
for so admirably, and set out on our journey with an additional boy from
the mission to help us through the heavy snow of the Koyukuk valley. For
ten or twelve miles the way lay down the river, and the going was slow
and toilsome from the first, although there had been some passage from
Moses' Village to the mission, and there was, therefore, some trail. Our
start had been late--it is next to impossible to get an early start from
a mission; there is always some native who must have audience at the
last moment--and after the long repose we were so soft that the heavy
trail had wearied us, and we decided to "call it a day" when in five and
a half hours we came to the road-house, the last occupied habitation
between the Allakaket and Tanana. Soon after we reached the village
there came trooping down from the mission a number of the inhabitants
gone up for Christmas, who, after weeping upon our necks, so to speak,
at our departure, had left us to break out that drifted trail for their
convenient return. So will Indians treat a white man almost always, but
I had thought myself an exception and was vexed to find that so they had
treated me.

The next morning we entered the uninhabited wilderness with three feet
of new snow on the trail and no passage over it since it had fallen. Our
first trouble was finding the trail at all. The previous fall the Alaska
Road Commission had appropriated a sum of money to stake this trail from
Tanana to the Koyukuk River, for it passes over wind-swept, treeless
wastes, where many men had lost their way. Starting out from Tanana, the
men employed had done their work well until within ten miles of the
Koyukuk River. There it was found that the labour and cost already
expended had exhausted the appropriation, whereupon the proceedings were
immediately stopped; not another stake was driven, and the whole party
returned to Tanana and mushed two hundred and fifty miles up the Yukon
to spend another little appropriation upon another trail. That is the
unbusinesslike system in which the money available for such work in
Alaska has been handled.

The first trail breaker goes ahead with a long stick, which he thrusts
continually down through the snow. The slightly harder surface over
which sleds and dogs have passed reveals itself by offering more
resistance to the penetration of the stick, and that is the only way the
trail can be found. Even with three feet of new snow upon it, it is well
worth while finding, or otherwise there is no bottom at all and way must
be made through all the snow of the winter. But all Alaskan trails are
serpentine, and it is very difficult to put the new trail right on top
of the old one. Back and forth the second trail breaker goes between his
leader and the sled, and at intervals the first man comes back and forth
also. And with it all is no path packed solid enough for the dogs to
draw the heavy sled without great difficulty. We should have had a
toboggan, but toboggans are little used on the Koyukuk, and we had only
our sled. In five hours we made five miles and were worn out. We decided
to pitch our tent and go ahead and break trail for the morrow's
journey. On the lakes interspersed amongst the brush we had to break an
entirely new trail, for we could find no trace of the old one.

If five miles in five hours be poor going, what is four miles in seven
and a half hours? That is all we made the next day despite the
snow-shoeing of the previous evening. The heavy sled was continually
getting off the trail, however wide we show-shoed it. The two of us
ahead went over every step of the distance four or five times, and
sometimes all of us had to go back and forth again and again before the
sled could be brought along at all. It was from 5° to 10° above zero all
day, and at intervals snow fell heavily. We got at last to the middle of
a little lake and were confronted by open water, the result of some warm
spring, one supposes. Here we must stop until a laborious journey was
made to the bank, trees were cut and carried, and the open place bridged
so that the sled might be passed over it. Then again our painful
progress was resumed until, as it grew dark, we reached the bank of the
Kornutna, or Old Man Creek, and here we pitched tent again, and I went
forward upon the bed of the stream to break out a part of to-morrow's
path. That night two more inches of snow fell.

[Sidenote: DOG DRIVING]

For four miles the trail lies along the surface of this creek, and then
takes up a steep gully and over a divide. That four miles was all we
made the next day, back and forth, back and forth, wearily tramping it
to and fro, dogs and men alike exhausted with the toil. The hatefulness
of dog mushing usually appears under such circumstances; the whip is
constantly plied, the senseless objurgations rise shriller and fuller.
Once the sled is started, it must by any means be kept going, that as
great a distance as possible may be covered before it stops again. The
poor brutes, sinking almost to their bellies despite the snow-shoeing,
have no purchase for the exercise of their strength and continually
flounder and wallow. Our whip was lost and I was glad of it, for even as
considerate a boy as Arthur is apt to lose patience and temper when,
having started the sled with much labour by gee pole and rope about his
chest, it goes but a few feet and comes to a halt again, or slips from
the track and turns over in the deep snow. But it is at such times, too,
that one appreciates at his full value such a noble puller as our wheel
dog Nanook. He spares himself not at all; the one absorbing occupation
of every nerve and muscle of his body is pulling. His trace is always
taut, or, if he lose footing for a moment and the trace slacken, he is
up and at it again that the sled lose not its momentum if he can help
it. When the lead line is pulled back that the sled may be started by
the jerk of the dogs' sudden traction, Nanook lunges forward at the
command, "Mush!" and strains at the collar, mouth open and panting,
tongue dropping moisture, as keen and eager to keep that sled moving as
is the driver himself. All day he labours and struggles, snatching a
mouthful of snow now and then to cool his overheated body, and he drops
in his tracks when the final halt is made, utterly weary, yet always
with the brave heart in him to give his bark, his five-note
characteristic bark of gladness, that the day's work is done at last.
It is senseless brutality to whip such a dog, and most of our dogs were
of that mettle, though Nanook was the strongest and most faithful of the
bunch. One's heart goes out to them with gratitude and love--old
"Lingo," "Nig," "Snowball," "Wolf," and "Doc"--as one realises what
loyal, cheerful service they give.

[Sidenote: VIOLENT FLUCTUATIONS]

Arthur was so unwell with a violent cold and cough, that had been
growing worse for a couple of days, that I decided on two things: to
leave him in the tent while I snow-shoed ahead the next day, and to send
back the boy I had brought from the mission to secure a fresh supply of
food; for the back trail was, of course, comparatively easy. Arthur's
condition threatened pneumonia, to my notion, and I believe he was saved
from an attack of that disease which is so often fatal in this country
by long rubbing all over the neck and the chest with a remedy that was
new then--a menthol balm. I have used it again and again since and I am
now never without it. A second application made in the morning, I
started out, show-shoeing up the long hill and then down into the flat,
and so to the mail-carrier's little hut that is reached under good
conditions of trail the first day from Moses' Village, and then back
again to the tent. That day a tendon in my right leg behind the knee
became increasingly troublesome, and in climbing the hill on the return
was acutely painful. I recognised it as "mal-de-raquet," well known in
the Northwest, where the snow is commonly much deeper than in Alaska,
and I found relief in the application of the same analgesic menthol balm
that I was rejoiced to find had wrought a great improvement in Arthur's
condition.

Meanwhile the warm weather of the past three or four days was over and
another period of violent fluctuations of temperature similar to that
around Christmastide was upon us. We went to bed with the thermometer at
10° below zero and were wakened by the cold at two in the morning to
find it at 40° below, so we had to keep a fire going the rest of the
night; for as soon as the fire in the stove goes out a tent becomes just
as cold as outdoors.

We moved forward the next morning, but the trail we had broken was too
narrow and had to be widened, which meant one snow-shoe in the deep snow
all the time, a very fatiguing process that brought into painful play
again the tendon strained with five days' heavy snow-shoeing.

The temperature was around 40° below all day, and our progress was so
slow that it was not easy to keep warm, and the dogs whined at the
innumerable stops. Yesterday it had been 10° below, the day before 10°
above, and now, to-day, 40° below. It is hard to dress for such
changeable weather, especially hard to dress the feet. My own wear, all
the winter through, is a pair of smoke-tanned, moose-hide breeches,
tanned on the Yukon but tailored outside. They are a perfect windbreak,
yet allow ventilation, and they are very warm; but those who perspire
much on exertion cannot wear them. The amount of covering upon the feet
must be varied, in some measure at least, as the temperature changes.
The Esquimau fur boot, with fur on the inside of the sole and on the
outside of the upper, is my favourite footwear, with more or less of
sock inside it as the weather requires; but such sudden changes as we
were experiencing always find one or leave one with too much or too
little footwear. By one-thirty we had struggled to the top of the hill,
and it was very evident that the cabin was out of the question that day;
so, since to pass down into the flat was to pass out of eligible camping
timber, we pitched tent on the brow of the hill.

The cold business of making camp was done, all dispositions for the
night complete, supper for men and dogs was cooked and ours eating, when
we heard a noise in the distance that set our dogs barking and presently
came the boy I had sent back, accompanied by an Indian and a fresh team
loaded with such a bountiful supply of food, much of it cooked, that one
felt it was worth while to get into distress to receive such generous
and prompt succour. The ladies at the mission had sat up and cooked all
night and had despatched the fastest team in the village the next
morning to bring their provisions to us and to help us along. They had
thought us at Tanana when we were not yet at the end of the first day's
stage from Moses' Village. It would have been impossible for us to reach
Tanana on the dog food and man food we started with.

[Sidenote: SIXTY-FIVE BELOW ZERO]

It was so cold and we were so crowded that I arose at three and made a
fire and sat over it the rest of the night, and after breakfast,
although it was Sunday, morning prayer being said, I started ahead again
to break out the trail deeper and wider, leaving the teams with the
distributed loads to follow. The thermometer stood at 38° below zero
when I left camp, but as I began the descent it was evident that it grew
colder, and at the bottom of the hill I was sure it was 20° colder at
least. Reaching the cabin, I kindled a fire and started back to meet the
teams. About a mile from the cabin I saw them, for, since the load was
distributed in the two sleds progress was much better; but by this time
it had grown so cold that the dogs were almost entirely obscured from
view by the clouds of steam that encompassed them. We hurried as best we
might and reached the cabin about eleven, and as soon as we were arrived
I took out the thermometer and let it lie long enough to get the
temperature of the air, and it read 65° below zero. There had been no
atmospheric change at all; it was simply the most marked instance I ever
knew of the influence of altitude upon temperature. We had descended
perhaps three hundred feet, and in that distance had found a difference
of 27° in temperature.

The cabin was a wretched shack without door or window and full of holes,
and in no part of it could one stand upright. We set ourselves to make
things as comfortable as possible, however, rigging up the canvas sled
cover for an outer door and a blanket for an inner door, and stopping up
the worst of the holes with sacking. Then we went out and cut fresh
spruce boughs to lie upon, and prospected around quite a while before we
found dry wood nearly a quarter of a mile away. It was quite a business
cutting that wood and packing the heavy sticks on one's shoulders,
through the brush and up and down the banks of the little creek where
it grew, on snow-shoes, at 65° below zero.

Our Sabbath day's journey done, the hut safely reached and furnished
with fuel, we did not linger long after supper, but, evening prayer
said, went to bed as the most comfortable place in the still cold cabin,
thankful not to be in a tent in such severe weather.

The next day gave us fresh temperature fluctuations. At nine A. M. it
clouded and rose to 35° below, by noon it had cleared again and the
thermometer fell to 55° below, and at nine P. M. it stood once more at
65° below. The milder weather of the morning sent all hands out breaking
trail, save myself, for with all our stuff in a cabin without a door it
was not wise to leave it altogether--a dog might break a chain and work
havoc--so I stayed behind in the little dark hovel, a candle burning all
day, and read some fifty pages of Boswell's _Life of Samuel Johnson_
over again. Some such little India-paper classic it is my habit to carry
each winter. Last year I reread Pepys's _Diary_ and the year before much
of the _Decline and Fall_. Certain places are for ever associated in my
mind with the rereading of certain old books. The Chandalar River is to
me as much the scene of _Lorna Doone_, which I read for the sixth or
seventh time on my first journey along it, as Exmoor itself; and _The
Cloister and the Hearth_, that noble historical romance, belongs in my
literary geography to the Alatna-Kobuk portage. So will Boswell always
bring back to me this trip across country from the Koyukuk to the Yukon
through the deep snow.

The boys came back after dark, having broken some nine miles of trail
and having suffered a good deal from the cold. I had supper cooked, and
when that was done and the dogs fed we fell to reading the Gospels and
Epistles for the Epiphany season, the boys reading aloud by turns. The
all-day fire had warmed the little hut thoroughly, and despite the cold
outside we were snug and comfortable within.

[Sidenote: SEVENTY BELOW ZERO]

That night the thermometer touched 70° below zero, within 2° of the
greatest cold I have recorded in seven years' winter travel; a greater
cold, I believe, than any arctic expedition has ever recorded, for it is
in a continental climate like Siberia or interior Alaska, and not in the
marine climate around the North Pole, that the thermometer falls lowest.

Save for an hour or two getting wood, we all lay close next day, for the
temperature at noon was no higher than 64° below. It is impossible to
break trail at such temperature, or to travel as slowly as we were
travelling. In the strong cold one must travel fast if one travel at
all. Indeed, it is distinctly dangerous to be outdoors. As soon as one
leaves the hut the cold smites one in the face like a mailed fist. The
expiration of the breath makes a crackling sound, due, one judges, to
the sudden congealing of the moisture that is expelled. From every
cranny of the cabin a stream of smoke-like vapour pours into the air,
giving the appearance that the house is on fire within. However warmly
hands and feet may be clad, one cannot stand still for a minute without
feeling the heat steadily oozing out and the cold creeping in.

Notwithstanding the weather, that evening the mail came along, the
white man who is the carrier, two tall, strong natives, and nine dogs.
Only since descending to the flat had they suffered from the cold, for
they found as great a difference as we did in the temperature; and they
were grateful to us for the trail we had broken. The hut was
uncomfortably crowded that night with seven people in it, but the
thermometer stood at -56° and was rising, and gave us hope that we might
move along to-morrow. Augmented as our party was into seven men, three
sleds, and nineteen or twenty dogs, trail breaking would not be so
arduous and progress would be much accelerated. There was good hope,
moreover, that the heavy snow was confined to the Koyukuk valley and
that when we passed out of it we should find better going.

The morning found a temperature of 45° below, and we sallied forth,
quite an expedition. Four, including myself, went ahead beating down the
trail; one was at each gee pole, our team last, getting advantage of
everything preceding. So far as the trail had been broken we made good
time, covering the nine miles in about four hours. Another hour of
somewhat slower progress took us to the top of a hill, and here the
mail-carrier's two Indians had run ahead and built a great, roaring fire
and arranged a wide, commodious couch of spruce boughs, and we cooked
our lunch and took our ease for half an hour. The sky had clouded again
and the temperature had risen to 28° below.

[Sidenote: CLOSE QUARTERS]

It is strange how some scenes of the trail linger in the memory, while
others are completely forgotten. This noon halt I always remember as
one of the pleasantest of all my journeyings. There was not a breath of
wind, and the smoke rose straight into the air instead of volleying and
eddying into one's face as camp-fires so often do on whichever side of
them one sits. We were all weary with our five hours' trudge, and the
rest was grateful; hungry, and the boiled ham they had sent from the
mission was delicious. The warmth of the great fire and the cosiness of
the thick, deep spruce boughs gave solid comfort, and the pipe after the
meal was a luxurious enjoyment.

From that on the going was heavier and our progress slower, but we kept
at it till dark, and still far into the night, fortunate in having two
Indians who knew every step of the way, until at last we reached the hut
that marks the end of the second stage from the Koyukuk River, on the
top of a birch hill. We had made nineteen and a half miles that day and
had taken eleven hours to do it.

If the noon rest be remembered as one of the pleasantest episodes of the
trail, that night in the cabin on the hill I recall as one of the most
miserable in my life. The hut was still smaller than the previous one,
like it without door and window, and so low that one was bent double all
the time. Walls and roof alike were covered with a thick coating of
frost. The only wood discoverable in the dark was half-dry birch which
would not burn in the stove but sent out volumes of smoke that blinded
us. When the hut did begin to get a little warm, moisture from the roof
dropped on everything. There we seven men huddled together, chilly and
damp, choked and weary--a wretched band. There was no room for the
necessary cooking operations; we had to cook and eat in relays; and how
we slept, in what way seven men managed to pack themselves and stretch
themselves in those narrow quarters, I cannot tell. However, we said our
prayers and went to bed, snow falling heavily. The Indians were soon
snoring, but sleep would not come to me, tired as I was, and I had not
slept at all the previous night. So presently I took trional, X grs.,
and dozed off till morning.

Then we resolved to divide forces rather than subject ourselves to the
miserable inconvenience of overcrowding these tiny huts, and at this
stage of the journey it was possible to do so without losing a whole
day, for there was a cabin for the noon rest. It was arranged that the
mail-man should start first and make the full day's run if possible,
while we should "call it a day" at the half-way hut.

So Bob and his Indians sallied forth while yet my boys were reading
their lessons to me, and when they were done we hitched up and followed.
And as soon as we were down the hill and started along the bald flat, it
was evident that we were out of the deep snowfall, for the present at
any rate, and we plucked up spirit, for we were now to cross the wide,
open, wind-swept uplands of the headwaters of the Melozitna and Tozitna,
tributaries of the Yukon--the "Tozi" and "Melozi," as the white men call
them--where snow never lies deep or long. We were out of the Koyukuk
watershed now and in country drained by direct tributaries of the
Yukon. The going was now incomparably the best we had had since we left
the mission, the snow was light and we had the mail-carrier's trail;
but, although the temperature had risen to 21° below, a keen wind put
our parkee hoods up and our scarfs around our faces and made our 60°
below clothing none too warm. In three hours we had reached the Melozi
cabin, although that had included the climbing of a long, steep hill,
and here we stayed for the rest of the day and night and shot some
ptarmigan for supper, though we could easily have gone on and made the
rest of the run.

The next day I sent the auxiliary sled and team and driver back to the
Allakaket, keeping the mission boy with me, however, to return with the
mail-carrier, who was already late and must go back as soon as he
reached Tanana. I parted with the Indian regretfully, for he had been
most helpful and always good-natured and cheerful, and had really begun
to learn a little at our travelling night-school.

[Sidenote: THE STAKED TRAIL]

[Sidenote: THE ARCTIC SKIES]

A high wind was blowing, with the thermometer at 12° below, and the
mail-man's trail was already drifted over and quite indistinguishable in
the dark, and we began to appreciate the recent staking of this trail by
the Road Commission. But for these stakes, set double, a hundred yards
apart, so that they formed a lane, it would have been difficult if not
impossible for us to travel on a day like this, for here was a stretch
of sixteen or seventeen miles with never a tree and hardly the smallest
bush. The wind blew stronger and stronger directly in our faces as we
rose out of the Melozitna basin on the hill that is its watershed, and
when the summit was reached and we turned and looked back there was
nothing visible but a white, wind-swept waste. But ahead all the snow
was most beautifully and delicately tinted from the reflection of the
dawn on ragged shredded clouds that streamed across the southeastern
sky. Where the sky was free of cloud it gave a wonderful clear green
that was almost but not quite the colour of malachite. It was exactly
the colour of the water the propeller of a steamship churns up where the
Atlantic Ocean shallows to the rocky shore of the north coast of
Ireland. The clouds themselves caught a deep dull red from the sunrise,
which the snow gave back in blush pink. Such an exquisite colour harmony
did the scene compose that the wind, lulling for a moment on the crest
of the hill, seemed charmed into peace by it.

The feast of colour brought a train of colour memories, one hard upon
the heels of another, as we went down the hill; the Catbells, this
golden with bracken, that purple with heather, and each doubled in the
depths of Derwentwater; an October morning in the hardwood forests of
the mountains of Tennessee, when for half an hour every gorgeous tint of
red and yellow was lavishly flaunted--and then the whole pride and
splendour of it wiped out at once by a wind that sprang up; the
encircling and towering reds and pinks of a gigantic amphitheatre of
rock in the Dolomites; a patch of flowers right against the snow in the
high Rockies, so intensely blue that it seemed the whole vault of heaven
could be tinctured with the pigment that one petal would distil. And,
more inspiring than them all, there came the recollection of that
wonderful sunrise and those blazing mountains of the Alatna-Kobuk
portage. Every land has its glories, and the sky is everywhere a blank
canvas for the display of splendid colour, but the tints of the arctic
sky are of an infinite purity of individual tone that no other sky can
show.

As we descended the hill into the Tozitna basin the wind rose again, now
charged with heavy, driving snow, while in the valley the underfoot snow
grew deep, so that it was drawing to dusk when we reached the cabin on a
fork of the Tozitna where Bob the mail-man had spent the previous night,
and there we stayed.

The next day is worthy of record for the sharp contrast it affords. All
the night it had snowed heavily, and it snowed all the morning and into
the afternoon. Some sixteen or seventeen inches of snow had fallen since
Bob and his party passed, and again we had no trail at all.
Moreover--strange plaint in January in Alaska!--the weather grew so warm
that the snow continually balled up under the snow-shoes and clung to
the sled and the dogs. At noon the thermometer stood at 17° above
zero--and it was but four days ago that we recorded 70° below! It will
be readily understood how such wide and sudden ranges of temperature add
to the inconvenience and discomfort of mushing. Parkees, sweaters,
shirts are shed one after the other, the fur cap becomes a nuisance, the
mittens a burden, and still ploughing through the snow he is bathed in
sweat who had forgotten what sweating felt like. The poor dogs suffer
the most, for they have nothing they can shed and they can perspire only
through the mouth. Their tongues drop water almost in a stream, they
labour for their breath, and their eyes have a look that comes only with
soft weather and a heavy trail. So constantly do they grab mouthfuls of
snow that the operation becomes quite a check on our progress.

By two o'clock it was growing dusk, and we had but reached the bank of
the other fork of the Tozitna, not more than eight or nine miles from
the cabin where we spent the night and yet thirteen or fourteen miles
from the cabin we had hoped to reach. Beyond the banks of the stream was
no more timber for a long distance; was such another stretch of open
country as we had passed the previous day. So here was another
disappointment, for camp must be made now lest there be no chance to
make camp at all. But it was a good and comfortable camp, amidst the
large spruce of the watercourse. Such disappointments are part of life
on the trail; and supper done there was the more time for the boys.

The open country was again wind-swept, and being wind-swept the snow was
somewhat hardened, and we fought our way against a gale, covering the
twelve and three quarter miles in ten hours, Sunday though it was. At
that last stage on the road to Tanana came out a young man from the
mission with a dog team and an Indian, anxious at our long delay, and
Harry Strangman's name is written here with grateful recognition of this
kindness and many others. We went joyfully into town on the morrow, the
17th of January, having taken fifteen days to make a journey that is
normally made in five.

[Sidenote: THE MAIL-CARRIER]

Half-way on that last day's mush we met the mail-man returning to the
Koyukuk. So much had he been delayed that there was danger of a fine and
all sorts of trouble, and the mail had been sent out to meet him at the
noon cabin, together with a supply of grub for the return trip. But the
caterer, whoever he was, forgot candles, and the mail-man would have had
to make his way back to the Koyukuk without any means of artificial
light, in the shortest days of the year, had we not been able to supply
him with half a dozen candles that remained to us. It was a
disappointment to George, the boy I had brought from the mission, that
he must turn round and go back also. He had never "seen Tanana," which
is quite a metropolis to him, and had looked forward to it keenly all
the journey, but the boy braced up and took his disappointment manfully.
A pitiful procession it was that passed us by and took our boy away; the
poor, wearied dogs that had certainly earned the few days' rest they
were so badly in need of left a trail of blood behind them that was
sickening to see. Almost every one of them had sore, frozen feet; many
of them were lame; and when we came to descend the long hill they had
just climbed, right at its brow, where the stiffest pull had been, was a
claw from a dog's foot frozen into bloody snow.

So far as there is anything heroic about the Alaskan trail, the
mail-carriers are the real heroes. They must start out in all weathers,
at all temperatures; they have a certain specified time in which to make
their trips and they must keep within that time or there is trouble. The
bordering country of the Canadian Yukon has a more humane government
than ours. There neither mail-carrier nor any one else, save in some
life-or-death emergency, with licence from the Northwest Mounted Police,
may take out horse or dogs to start a journey when the temperature is
lower than 45° below zero; but I have seen a reluctant mail-carrier
chased out at 60° below zero, on pain of losing his job, on the American
side. Moreover, between the seasons, when travel on the rivers is
positively dangerous to life, the mail must still be despatched and
received, although so great is the known risk to the mail, as well as to
the carrier, that no one will send any letter that he cares at all about
reaching its destination until the trails are established or the
steamboats run. But the virtually empty pouches must be transported from
office to office through the running, or over the rotting ice, just the
same, on pain of the high displeasure and penalty of a department
without brains and without bowels. I have often wished since I came to
Alaska that I could be postmaster-general for one week, and so I suppose
has almost every other resident of the country.

The week following my arrival at Tanana was a solid week of cold
weather, the thermometer ranging around 50° and 60° below zero, and that
means keeping pretty close to the house. Even the sentries at the army
post are withdrawn and the protection of the garrison is confided to a
man who watches the grounds from a glass-walled cupola above the
headquarters building. Yet a week of confinement and inaction grows
tiresome after life in the open.

Sunday is always a busy day here. The mission and native village are
three miles away from the town, and service must be held at both. The
mission at Tanana is not a happy place to visit for one who has the
welfare of the natives at heart. Despite faithful and devoted effort to
check it, the demoralisation goes on apace and the outlook is dark.

[Sidenote: SINGLE MEN IN BARRACKS]

"Single men in barracks don't grow into plaster saints," we are told;
sometimes they seem to grow into drunken, lustful devils without
compassion for childhood, not to mention any feeling of magnanimity
towards a feebler race. And when a girl who has been rough-handled, or
who has been given drink until she is unable to resist the multiple
outrage practised upon her, is told to pick out the malefactors from a
company of soldiers, all clean-shaven, all dressed alike, all around the
same age, she generally fails to identify altogether. So the offence
goes unwhipped, and the officer is likely as not to address a reprimand
to the complaining missionary for "preferring charges you are unable to
substantiate." Yet an officer who had himself written such a letter told
me once that all Indians looked alike to him. Even should the girl
identify one or more men, they have usually half a dozen comrades ready
to swear an alibi.

Add to the trouble given by the soldiers the constant operation of the
slinking bootleggers of the town, a score or more of whom are known to
make money by this liquor peddling, and some of whom do nothing else for
a living, yet whom it is next to impossible to convict, owing to the
cumbrous machinery of the law and the attitude of juries, and it will be
seen that the hands of those who are fighting for the native race are
tied.

What has been said about the military does not by any means apply to
all, either officers or men. Some of the officers have been decent,
God-fearing men, conscious of the evil and zealous to suppress it; some
of the men, indeed in all probability most of the men, quite free from
such offence; some commanding officers have kept such a well-disciplined
post that offences of all kinds have been greatly reduced. But the
commanding officer is changed every year, and the whole force is changed
every two years, so that there is no continuity of policy at the post,
and an administration that has grown familiar with conditions and that
stands so far as it can for clean living and sobriety and decency and
the protection of the native people, may be followed by one that is
loftily ignorant of the situation, careless about offences against
morality, and impatient of any complaint.

Off by himself, separate from the demoralising influence of the low-down
white, there is every hope and encouragement in the effort to elevate
and educate the Indian; set down cheek by jowl with the riffraff of
towns and barracks, his fate seems sealed.

[Sidenote: DEATH-RATE AND BIRTH-RATE]

Let these two mission stations, the Allakaket and Tanana, one hundred
and fifty miles or so apart by the winter trail, represent the two
conditions. In six years' time there has been manifest advance at the
one and decay at the other. The birth-rate is greatly in excess of the
death-rate at the Allakaket, the death-rate greatly in excess of the
birth-rate at Tanana. In the year in which this journey was made there
were thirty-four deaths and fourteen births at Tanana, and while the
difference was an unusually large one, yet in the six years referred to
there has not been one year in which the number of births exceeded the
number of deaths. One does not have to be a prophet to foresee the
inevitable result, if the process be not stopped.

A tribute should be paid to the zeal, now of one, now of another army
surgeon at Fort Gibbon in tending the native sick, three miles away,
when we have been unable to procure a physician of our own for the
place. The missionary nurse, for five years last past Miss Florence
Langdon, has been greatly helped in her almost desperate efforts here by
the willing co-operation of these medical officers of the army.

CHAPTER VIII

UP THE YUKON TO RAMPART AND ACROSS COUNTRY TO THE TANANA--ALASKAN
AGRICULTURE--THE GOOD DOG NANOOK--MISS FARTHING'S BOYS AT NENANA--CHENA
AND FAIRBANKS


OUR course from Tanana did not lie directly up the Tanana River, but up
the Yukon to Rampart and then across country to the Hot Springs on the
Tanana River. The seventy-five miles up the Yukon was through the Lower
Ramparts, one of the most picturesque portions of this great river. The
stream is confined in one deep channel by lofty mountains on both banks,
and the scenery at times is very bold and wild. But its topography makes
it the natural wind course of the country--a down-river wind in winter,
an up-river wind in summer blows almost continually. It was no colder
than 5° below zero when we started on the trip, but the wind made the
travelling unpleasant. The second day it had increased to a gale, and
every mile we travelled it grew stronger. We travelled three hours, and
the last hour we made scarcely a mile. So thickly charged with flying
snow was the wind and so dead ahead that despite parkee hoods it blinded
us, and the dogs could hardly be forced to keep their heads towards it.
Their faces were so coated with crusted snow that they looked curiously
like the face of harlequin in the pantomime. It did become literally
intolerable, and when Arthur said that he knew there was a cabin right
across the river, we made our way thither and shortly found it and lay
there the rest of the day, the gale blowing incessantly. This was
disappointing, because it meant that I could not reach Rampart for the
Sunday I had appointed.

Next day the wind had ceased and the thermometer went down to 30° below
zero. In places the ice was blown clear of snow; in other places it was
heavily drifted. By midday we had reached the lonely telegraph station
at "The Rapids," and were very kindly received by the signal-corps men
in charge. They gave us to eat and to drink and would take no money.
There is little travel on this part of the river nowadays, and the
telegraph men are glad to see any one who may chance to pass by. We
pushed on heavily again, and had to stop and cut a gee pole presently,
for it was hard to handle the sled without it; but the gee pole always
means laborious travel. The cold was welcome; it meant no wind; and we
were glad to see the thermometer drop lower than 50° below zero that
night at the old mail cabin. The mail goes no longer on the Yukon River
from Fort Yukon to Tanana, and, barring this point, Rampart, towards
which we were travelling, which is supplied across country from the Hot
Springs, over the route we should traverse, no spot on that three
hundred and fifty miles of river receives any mail at all. The
population is small and scattered, it is true; on the same grounds
Alaska might be denied any mail at all. There has been much resentment
at this abandonment of the Yukon River by the post-office and several
petitions for its restoration, but it has not been restored.

[Sidenote: THE WIND-SWEPT YUKON]

We travelled all the next day at 50° below zero, and it was one of the
pleasantest days of the winter. There was not a breath of wind, the
going steadily improved, and, best of all, for three hours we were
travelling in the sunshine for the first time this winter. Only those
who have been deprived of the sun can really understand how joyful and
grateful his return is. There was no heat in his rays, this last day of
January; the thermometer stood at 49° below at noon, and had risen but
5° since our start in the morning; but the mere sight of him glowing in
the south, where a great bend of the river gave him to us through a gap
in the mountains, was cheerful and invigorating after two months in
which we had seen no more than his gilding of the high snows. The sun
gives life to the dead landscape, colour to the oppressive monotony of
white and black, and man's heart leaps to the change as jubilantly as
does the face of nature.

[Sidenote: RAMPART AND ITS SALOON]

Rampart City differs from Circle City, the other decayed mining town of
the Yukon River, only in that the process is further advanced. Year by
year there are a few less men on the creeks behind it, a few less
residents in the town itself. Its long, straggling water-front consists
in the main of empty buildings, the windows boarded up, the snow drifted
high about the doors. One store now serves all ends of trade, one liquor
shop serves all the desire for drink of the whites, and slops over
through the agency of two or three dissolute squaw men and half-breeds
to the natives up and down the river.[C]

Rampart had one fat year, 1898, when many hundreds of gold seekers,
approaching the Klondike by Saint Michael and the lower Yukon were
attracted and halted by the gold discoveries on Big and Little Minook,
and spent the winter here. The next spring news was brought of the rich
discoveries on Anvil Creek, behind Cape Nome, and an exodus began which
grew into a veritable stampede in 1900, when the gold discoveries in the
beach itself were made. Rampart's large population faded away as surely
and as quickly to Nome as Circle City's population did to the Klondike.
The Indians are almost all gone from their village a mile above the
town; they dwindled away with the dwindling prosperity, some to Tanana,
some to other points down the river; and what used to be the worst small
native community in the interior of Alaska has almost ceased to exist.
Most of the little band of white folks still remaining were gathered
together at night, and appreciated, I thought, their semiannual
opportunity for Divine service.

[Sidenote: "DEVELOPED"]

There is no resisting the melancholy that hangs over a place like this.
As one treads the crazy, treacherous board sidewalks, full of holes and
rotten planks, now rising a step or two, now falling, and reads the
dimmed and dirty signs that once flaunted their gold and colours,
"Golden North," "Pioneer," "Reception," "The Senate" (why should every
town in Alaska have a "Senate" saloon and not one a "House of
Representatives"?), one conjures up the scenes of rude revelry these
drinking places witnessed a few years ago. How high the hopes of sudden
riches burned in the breasts of the men who went in and out of them,
doomed to utter disappointment in the vast majority! What a rapscallion
crew, male and female, followed this great mob of gold seekers, and grew
richer as their victims grew poorer! What earned and borrowed and saved
and begged and stolen moneys were frittered away and flung away that
winter; what health and character were undermined! How the ribaldry and
valiant, stupid blasphemy rang out in these tumbling-down shanties! Go
out on the creeks and see the hills denuded of their timber, the
stream-beds punched with innumerable holes, filled up or filling up, the
cabins and sluice-boxes rotting into the moss, here and there a broken
pick and shovel, here and there a rusting boiler, and take notice that
this region has been "developed."

When the debit and credit sides of the ledger are balanced, what remains
to Alaska of all these thousands of men, of all the many hundreds of
thousands of dollars they brought with them? Those creeks, stripped,
gutted, and deserted; this town, waiting for a kindly fire with a
favouring breeze to wipe out its useless emptiness; a few half-breed
children at mission schools; a hardy native tribe, sophisticated,
diseased, demoralised, and largely dead--that seems the net result.

The portage trail from Rampart to the Tanana River goes up Minook Creek
and follows the valley to its head, then crosses a summit and passes
down through several small mining settlements to the Hot Springs. The
trail saves traversing two sides of the triangle which it makes with the
two rivers.

The dogs' feet and legs had suffered so much from the deep snow and the
heavy labour of the journey out of the Koyukuk and the rough ice of the
Yukon that I was compelled to have not merely moccasins but moose-hide
leggings made here, coming right up to the belly and tying over the
back. All the hair was worn away from the back of the legs and the skin
was in many places raw.

We had thought to cover the twenty-five or thirty miles up the valley
and over the summit to a road-house just beyond its foot, but rough
drifted trails and a high wind held us back until it was dark before the
ascent was reached, and we pitched our tent and reserved the climb for
the morrow.

It was a hard grind owing to the drifted snow and the wind that still
disputed our passage, but the view from the summit, nearly eighteen
hundred feet above last night's camp, was compensation enough, for it
gave us the great mountain, Denali, or, as the map makers and some
white men call it, Mount McKinley. Perhaps an hundred and fifty miles
away, as the crow flies, it rose up and filled all the angle of vision
to the southwest. It is not a peak, it is a region, a great soaring of
the earth's crust, rising twenty thousand feet high; so enormous in its
mass, in its snow-fields and glaciers, its buttresses, its flanking
spurs, its far-flung terraces of foot-hills and approaches, that it
completely dominates the view whenever it is seen at all. I have heard
people say they thought they had seen Denali, as I have heard travellers
say they thought they had seen Mount Everest from Darjiling; but no one
ever thought he saw Denali if he saw it at all. There is no possible
question about it, once the mountain has risen before the eyes; and
although Mount Everest is but the highest of a number of great peaks,
while Denali stands alone in unapproached predominance, yet I think the
man who has really looked upon the loftiest mountain in the world could
have no doubt about it ever after.

How my heart burns within me whenever I get view of this great monarch
of the North! There it stood, revealed from base to summit in all its
stupendous size, all its glistening majesty. I would far rather climb
that mountain than own the richest gold-mine in Alaska. Yet how its
apparent nearness mocks one; what time and cost and labour are involved
even in approaching its base with food and equipment for an attempt to
reach its summit! How many schemes I have pondered and dreamed these
seven years past for climbing it! Some day time and opportunity and
resource may serve, please God, and I may have that one of my heart's
desires; if not, still it is good to have seen it from many different
coigns of vantage, from this side and from that; to have felt the awe of
its vast swelling bulk, the superb dignity of its firm-seated,
broad-based uplift to the skies with a whole continent for a pedestal;
to have gazed eagerly and longingly at its serene, untrodden summit, far
above the eagle's flight, above even the most daring airman's venture,
and to have desired and hoped to reach it; to desire and hope to reach
it still.[D]

Plunging down the steep descent we went for four miles, and then after a
hearty dinner at the road-house, essayed to make twenty-one miles more
to the Hot Springs. But night fell again with a number of miles yet to
come, the recent storm had furrowed the trail diagonally with hard
windrows of snow that overturned the sled repeatedly and formed an
hindrance that grew greater and greater, and again we made camp in the
dark, short of our expected goal.

Of late I had been carrying an hip ring, a rubber ring inflated by the
breath that is the best substitute for a mattress. The ring had been
left behind at Rampart, and so dependent does one grow on the little
luxuries and ameliorations one permits oneself that these two nights in
camp were almost sleepless for lack of it.

[Sidenote: THE HOT SPRINGS]

Three hours more brought us to the spacious hotel, with its forty empty
rooms, that had been put up, out of all sense or keeping, in a wild,
plunging attempt to "exploit" the Hot Springs and make a great "health
resort" of the place. The hot water had been piped a quarter of a mile
or so to spacious swimming-baths in the hotel; all sorts of expense had
been lavished on the place; but it had been a failure from the first,
and has since been closed and has fallen into dilapidation. The bottoms
have dropped out of the cement baths, the paper hangs drooping from the
damp walls, the unsubstantial foundations have yielded until the floors
are heaved like the waves of the sea.[E] But at this time the hotel was
still maintained and we stayed there, and its wide entrance-hall and
lobby formed an excellent place to gather the inhabitants of the little
town for Divine service--again the only opportunity in the year.

What a curious phenomenon thermal springs constitute in these parts!
Here is a series of patches of ground, free from snow, while all the
country has been covered two or three feet deep these four months; green
with vegetation, while all living things elsewhere are wrapped in winter
sleep. Here is open, rushing water, throwing up clouds of steam that
settles upon everything as dense hoar frost, while all other water is
held in the adamantine fetters of the ice. Where does that constant
unfailing stream of water at 110° Fahrenheit come from? Where does it
get its heat? I know of half a dozen such thermal springs in
Alaska,--one far away above the Arctic Circle between the upper courses
of the Kobuk and the Noatak Rivers, that I have heard strange tales
about from the Esquimaux and that I have always wanted to visit.

Whenever I see this gush of hot water in the very midst of the ice and
the snow, I am reminded of my surprise on the top of Mount Tacoma. We
had climbed some eight thousand feet of snow and were shivering in a
bitter wind on the summit, yet when the hand was thrust in a cleft of
the rock it had to be withdrawn by reason of the heat. One knows about
the internal fire of some portion of the earth's mass, of course, but
such striking manifestations of it, such bold irruption of heat in the
midst of the kingdom of the cold, must always bring a certain
astonishment except to those who take everything as a matter of course.

It is evident that this hot water, capable of distribution over a
considerable area of land, makes an exceedingly favourable condition for
subarctic agriculture, and a great deal of ground has been put under
cultivation with large yield of potatoes and cabbage and other
vegetables. But the limitations of Alaskan conditions have shorn all
profit from the enterprise. There is no considerable market nearer than
Fairbanks, almost two hundred miles away by the river. If the potatoes
are allowed to remain in the ground until they are mature, there is the
greatest danger of the whole crop freezing while on the way to market,
and in any case the truck-farmers around Fairbanks find that their
proximity to the consumer more than offsets the advantage of the Hot
Springs.

[Sidenote: ARCTIC AGRICULTURE]

When the great initial difficulties of farming in Alaska are overcome,
when the moss is removed and the ground, frozen solidly to bedrock, is
broken and thawed, when its natural acidity is counteracted by the
application of some alkali, and its reeking surface moisture is drained
away; when after three or four years' cultivation it begins to make some
adequate return of roots and greens, there remains the constant
difficulty of a market. Around the mining settlements and during the
uncertain life of the mining settlements, truck-farming pays very well,
but it could easily be overdone so that prices would fall below the
point of any profit at all. Transportation is expensive, and rates for a
short haul on the rivers are high, out of all proportion to rates for
the long haul from the outside, so that potatoes from the Pacific coast
are brought in and sold in competition with the native-grown. And
despite the protestations of the agricultural experimental stations, the
outside or "chechaco" potato has the advantage of far better quality
than that grown in Alaska. Tastes differ, and a man may speak only as he
finds. For my part, I have eaten native potatoes raised in almost every
section of interior Alaska, and have been glad to get them, but I have
never eaten a native potato that compared favourably with any good
"outside" potato. The native potato is commonly wet and waxy; I have
never seen a native potato that would burst into a glistening mass of
white flour, or that had the flavour of a really good potato.

There has been much misconception about the interior of Alaska that
obtains yet in some quarters, although there is no excuse for it now.
Not only the interior of Alaska, but all land at or near sea-level in
the arctic regions that is not under glacial ice-caps, is snow free and
surface-thawed in the summer and has a luxuriant vegetation. The polar
ox (Sverdrup's protest against the term "musk-ox" should surely prevail)
ranges in great bands north of the 80th parallel and must secure
abundant food; and when Peary determined the insularity of Greenland he
found its most northerly point a mass of verdure and flowers.

No doubt potatoes and turnips, lettuce and cabbage, could be raised
anywhere in those regions; the intensity of the season compensates for
its shortness; the sun is in the heavens twenty-four hours in the day,
and all living things sprout and grow with amazing rankness and celerity
under the strong compulsion of his continuous rays. Spring comes
literally with a shout and a rush here in Alaska, and must cry even
louder and stride even faster in the "ultimate climes of the pole." If
the possibility of raising garden-truck and tubers constitutes a
"farming country," then all the arctic regions not actually under
glacial ice may be so classed.

Any one who visits the Koyukuk may see monster turnips and cabbages
raised at Coldfoot, near the 68th parallel; from Sir William Parry's
description we may feel quite sure that vegetables of size and
excellence might be raised at the head of Bushnan's Cove of Melville
Island, on the 75th parallel; he called it "an arctic paradise"; Greely
reported "grass twenty-four inches high and many butterflies" in the
interior of Grinnell Land under the 82d parallel; and if gold were ever
discovered on the north coast of Greenland one might quite expect to
hear that some enterprising Swede was growing turnips and cabbages at
Cape Morris Jessup above the 83d parallel, and getting a dollar a pound
for them.

In favourable seasons and in favourable spots of interior Alaska certain
early varieties of Siberian oats and rye have been matured, and it
stands to the credit of the Experiment Station at Rampart that a little
wheat was once ripened there, though it took thirteen months from the
sowing to the ripening. When the rest of the world fills up so that
economic pressure demands the utilisation of all earth that will produce
any sort of food, it may be that large tracts in Alaska will be put
under the plough; but it is hard to believe that nine tenths of all this
vast country will ever be other than wild waste land. At present the
farming population is strictly an appendage of the mining population,
and the mining population rather diminishes than increases.

Your health resort that no one will resort to is a dull place at best
and a poor dependence for merchandising, so that the little town of Hot
Springs is fortunate in having some mining country around it to fall
back upon for its trade. We lay an extra day there, waiting for the
stage from Fairbanks to break trail for us through the heavy, drifted
snow, having had enough of trail breaking for a while. At midnight the
stage came, two days late, and its coming caused me as keen a sorrow and
as great a loss as I have had since I came to Alaska.

[Sidenote: NANOOK'S DEATH]

We knew naught of it until the next morning, when, breakfast done and
the sled lashed, we were ready to hitch the dogs and depart. They had
been put in the horse stable for there was no dog house; the health
resorter, actual or prospective, is not likely to be a dog man one
supposes; but they were loose in the morning and came to the call, all
but one--Nanook. Him we sought high and low, and at last Arthur found
him, but in what pitiful case! He dragged himself slowly and painfully
along, his poor bowels hanging down in the outer hide of his belly,
fearfully injured internally, done for and killed already. It was not
difficult to account for it. When the horses came in at midnight, one of
them had kicked the dog and ruptured his whole abdomen.

There was no use in inquiring whose fault it was. The dogs should have
been chained; so much was our fault. But it was hard to resist some
bitter recollection that before this "exploitation" of the springs, when
there was a modest road-house instead of a mammoth hotel, there had been
kennels for dogs instead of nothing but stables for horses.

I doubt if all the veterinary surgeons in the world could have saved the
dog, but there was none to try; and there was only one thing to do, hate
it as we might. Arthur and I were grateful that neither of us had to do
it, for the driver of the mail stage, who had some compunctions of
conscience, I think, volunteered to save us the painful duty. "I know
how you feel," he said slowly and kindly; "I've got a dog I think a heap
of myself, but that dog ain't nothin' to me an' I'll do it for you."

Nanook knew perfectly well that it was all over with him. Head and tail
down, the picture of resigned dejection, he stood like a petrified dog.
And when I put my face down to his and said "Good-bye," he licked me for
the first time in his life. In the six years I had owned him and driven
him I had never felt his tongue before, though I had always loved him
best of the bunch. He was not the licking kind.

We hitched up our diminished team and pulled out, for we had thirty
miles to make in the short daylight and we had lost time already; and as
we crossed the bridge over the steaming slough we saw the man going
slowly down to the river with the dog, the chain in one hand, a gun in
the other. My eyes filled with tears; I could not look at Arthur nor he
at me as I passed forward to run ahead of the team, and I was glad when
I realised that we had drawn out of ear-shot.

All day as I trudged or trotted now on snow-shoes and now off, as the
trail varied in badness, that dog was in my mind and his loss upon my
heart, the feel of his tongue upon my cheek. It takes the close
companionship between a man and his dogs in this country, travelling all
the winter long, winter after winter, through the bitter cold and the
storm and darkness, through the long, pleasant days of the warm sunshine
of approaching spring, sharing labour and sharing ease, sharing
privation and sharing plenty; it takes this close companionship to make
a man appreciate a dog. As I reckoned it up, Nanook had fallen just
short of pulling my sled ten thousand miles. If he had finished this
season with me he would have done fully that, and I had intended to
pension him after this winter, to provide that so long as he lived he
should have his fish and rice every day. Some doubt I had had of old
Lingo lasting through the winter, but none of Nanook, and they were the
only survivors of my original team.

[Sidenote: THE TALKING DOG]

Nanook was in as good spirits as ever I knew him that last night, coming
to me and plumping his huge fore paws down on my moccasins, challenging
me to play the game of toe treading that he loved; and whenever he beat
me at it he would seize my ankle in his jaws and make me hop around on
one foot, to his great delight. He was my talking dog. He had more
different tones in his bark than any other dog I ever knew. He never
came to the collar in the morning, he never was released from it at
night, without a cheery "bow-wow-wow." And we never stopped finally to
make camp but he lifted up his voice. There was something curious about
that. Only two nights before, when we had been unable to reach the
health resort owing to wind-hardened drifts right across the trail that
overturned the heavy sled again and again, swing the gee pole as one
would, and had stopped several times in the growing dusk to inspect a
spot that seemed to promise a camping place, Arthur had remarked that
Nanook never spoke until the spot was reached on which we decided to
pitch the tent. What faculty he had of recognising a good place, of
seeing that both green spruce and dry spruce were there in sufficient
quantity, I do not know--or whether he got his cue from the tones of our
voice--but he never failed to give tongue when the stop was final and
never opened his mouth when it was but tentative.

I could almost tell the nature of any disturbance that arose from the
tone of Nanook's bark. Was it some stray Indian dog prowling round the
camp; was it the distant howling of wolves; was it the approach of some
belated traveller--there was a distinct difference in the way he
announced each. I well remember the new note that came into his
passionate protest when he was chained to a stump at the reindeer camp,
and the foolish creatures streamed all over the camping-ground that
night. To have them right beside him and yet be unable to reach them, to
have them brushing him with their antlers while he strained helplessly
at the chain, was adding insult to injury. And he kept me awake over it
all night and told me about it at intervals all next day.

The coat that dog had was the heaviest and thickest I ever saw. On his
back the long hair parted in the middle, and underneath the hair was fur
and underneath the fur was wool. He was an outdoors dog strictly. It was
only in the last year or two that he could be induced voluntarily to
enter a house; he seemed, like Mowgli, to have a suspicion of houses.
And if he did come in he had no respect for the house at all. When first
I had him he would dig and scratch out of a dog-house on the coldest
night, if he could, and lay himself down comfortably on the snow. Cold
meant little to him. Fifty, sixty, seventy below zero, all night long at
such temperatures he would sleep quite contentedly. The only difference
I could see that these low temperatures made to him was an increasing
dislike to be disturbed. When he had carefully tucked his nose between
his paws and adjusted his tail over all, he had gone to bed, and to make
him take his nose out of its nest and uncurl himself was like throwing
the clothes off a sleeping man. He never dug a hole for himself in the
snow. I never saw a dog do that yet. In my opinion that is one of the
nature-faker's stories. A dog lies in snow just as he lies in sand, with
the same preliminary turn-round-three-times that has been so much
speculated about. We always make a bed for them, when it is very cold,
by cutting and stripping a few spruce boughs, and they highly appreciate
such a couch and will growl and fight if another dog try to take it.
They need more food and particularly they need more fat when they lie
out at extreme low temperatures, and we seek to increase that element in
their rations by adding tallow or bacon or bear's-grease--or seal
oil--or whatever oleaginous substance we can come by.

[Sidenote: CANINE CHARACTER]

He was a most independent dog was Nanook, a thoroughly bad dog, as one
would say in some use of that term--a thief who had no shame in his
thievery but rather gloried in it. If you left anything edible within
his ingenious and comprehensive reach he regarded it as a challenge.
There comes to me a ludicrous incident that concerned a companion of one
winter journey. He had carefully prepared a lunch and had wrapped it
neatly in paper, and he placed it for a moment on the sled while he
turned to put his scarf about him. But in that moment Nanook saw it and
it was gone. Through the snow, over the brush, in and out amongst the
stumps the chase proceeded, until Nanook was finally caught and my
companion recovered most of the paper, for the dog had wolfed the grub
as he ran. He would stand and take any licking you offered and never
utter a sound but give a bark of defiance when you were done, and he
would bear you no ill will in the world and repeat his offence at the
next opportunity. Yet so absurdly sensitive was he in other matters of
his person that the simple operation of clipping the hair from between
his toes, to prevent the "balling-up" of the snow, took two men to
perform, one to sit on the dog and the other to ply the scissors, and
was accompanied always with such howls and squeals as would make a
hearer think we were flaying him alive.

Nanook's acquaintance with horses began in Fairbanks the first season I
owned him, before I had had the harness upon him, when he was rising two
years old. The dogs and I were staying at the hospital we had just
established--because in those days there was nowhere else to
stay--waiting for the winter. One of the mining magnates of the infancy
of the camp (broken and dead long since; Bret Harte's lines, "Busted
himself in White Pine and blew out his brains down in 'Frisco," often
occur to me as the sordid histories of to-day repeat those of fifty
years ago) had imported a saddle-horse and, as the mild days of that
charming autumn still deferred the snow, he used to ride out past the
hospital for a canter.

The dog had learned to lift the latch of the gate of the hospital yard
with his nose and get out, and when I put a wedge above the latch for
greater security he learned also to circumvent that precaution. And
whenever the horse and his rider passed, Nanook would open the gate and
lead the whole pack in a noisy pursuit that changed the canter to a run
and brought us natural but mortifying remonstrance.

The rider had just passed and the dogs had pursued as usual, and I had
rushed out and recalled them with difficulty. Nanook I had by the
collar. Dragging him into the yard, shutting the gate, and putting in
the wedge, I picked up a stick and gave him a few sharp blows with it.
Then flinging him off, I said: "Now, you stay in here; I'll give you a
sound thrashing if you do that again!" I was just getting acquainted
with him then. The moment I loosed his collar the dog went deliberately
to the gate, stood on his hind legs while he pulled out the wedge with
his teeth, lifted the latch with his nose and swung open the gate, and
standing in the midst turned round and said to me: "Bow-_wow_-wow-wow-wow-_wow_!"
It was so pointed that a passer-by, who had paused to see the
proceedings and was leaning on the fence, said to me: "Well, you know
where _you_ can go to. That's the doggonedest dog I ever seen!"

[Sidenote: PARTNERS]

It was a pleasure to come back to Nanook after any long absence--a
pleasure I was used to look forward to. There was no special fawning or
demonstration of affection; he was not that kind; that I might have from
any of the others; but from none but Nanook the bark of welcome with my
particular inflection in it that no one else ever got. "Well, well;
here's the boss again; glad to see you back"; that was about all it
said. For he was a most independent dog and took to himself an air of
partnership rather than subjection. Any man can make friends with any
dog if he will, there is no question about that, but it takes a long
time and mutual trust and mutual forbearance and mutual appreciation to
make a partnership. Not every dog is fit to be partner with a man; nor
every man, I think, fit to be partner with a dog.

Well, that long partnership was dissolved by the horse's hoof and I was
sore for its dissolution. There was none left now that could remember
the old days of the team save Lingo, and he grew crusty and somewhat
crabbed. He was still the guardian of the sled, still the insatiable
hand-shaker, but he grew more and more unsocial with his mates, and we
heard his short, sharp, angry double bark at night more frequently than
we used to. He reminded me of the complaining owl in Gray's "Elegy." He
resented any dog even approaching the sled, resented the dogs moving
about at all to disturb his "ancient solitary reign."

His work was well-nigh done, and old Lingo had honestly earned his rest.
With the end of this winter he would enter upon the easy old age that I
had designed for both of them. Lingo had never failed me; never let his
traces slack if he could keep them taut, never in his life had whip laid
on his back to make him pull; a faithful old work dog for whom I had a
hearty respect and regard. But he never found his way to my heart as
Nanook did. I loved Nanook, and had lost something personal out of my
life in losing him. There are other dogs that I am fond of--better dogs
in some ways that either Nanook or Lingo, swifter certainly--but I think
I shall never have two dogs again that have meant as much to me as these
two. All the other dogs were of the last two years and thought they
belonged to Arthur, who fed them and handled them most. But Nanook and
Lingo had seen boys come and boys go, and they knew better.

Six years is not very much of a man's life, but it is all a dog's life;
all his effective working life. Nanook had given it all to me,
willingly, gladly. He pulled so freely because he loved to pull. He
delighted in the winter, in the snow and the cold; rejoiced to be on the
trail, rejoiced to work. When we made ready to depart after a few days
at a mission or in a town, Nanook was beside himself with joy. He would
burst forth into song as he saw the preparations in hand, would run all
up and down the gamut of his singular flexible voice, would tell as
plainly to all around as though he spoke it in English and Indian and
Esquimau that the inaction had irked him, that he was eager to be gone
again.

Well, he was dead; as fine a dog as ever lived; as faithful and
intelligent a creature as any man ever had, not of human race, for
servant, companion, and friend. And I thought the more of myself that he
had put his tongue to my cheek when I said good-bye to him.

[Sidenote: THE AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER]

Here on the Tanana was one of the most interesting original characters
of the many in the land: an old inhabitant of Alaska and of the
Northwest who had followed many avocations and was now settled down on
the river bank, with a steamboat wood-yard, a road-house for the
entertainment of occasional travellers, and a little stock of trade
goods chiefly for Indians of the vicinity. A round, fat, pursy man he
was, past the middle life, with a twinkling eye and a bristling
moustache, and a most amazing knack of picking up new words and using
them incorrectly. He had fallen out with the great trading company of
Alaska and did almost all his purchasing from a "mail-order house" in
Chicago, the enormous quarto catalogue on the flimsiest thin paper
issued by that establishment being his chief book of reference and his
choice continual reading. He would declaim by the hour on the iniquitous
prices that prevail in the interior and had the quotations of prices of
every conceivable merchandise from his _vade mecum_ at his fingers'
ends.

But his chief passion of the past two or three years was photography, in
the which he had made but little progress, despite considerable
expenditures; and he had come to the conclusion about the time of our
visit that what he needed was a fine lens, although, as a matter of
fact, he had never learned to use his cheap one. He had recently become
acquainted with sensitive film and had ordered a supply. By a
transposition of letters, which the nature of the substance doubtless
confirmed in his mind when it arrived, he always spoke of these
convenient strips of celluloid as "flims," and was just now most
eloquently indignant that, although he had broken utterly with the
Northern Commercial Company and refused to trade with them at all, the
supply of "flims" he had received from the mail-order house were
labelled "N. C." "Them blamed monopolists has cornered the flims," he
exclaimed, and was hardly persuaded that the letters signified
"non-curling" and did not darkly hint at a conspiracy in restraint of
trade.

He produced and displayed a number of pieces of apparatus of a generally
useless kind which he had ordered on the strength of their much
advertising, and he observed sententiously, "We _armatures_ get badly
imposed upon." Here were patent gimcrack printing devices, although he
had scarce anything worth printing; all sorts of atrocious fancy borders
with which he sought in vain to embellish out-of-focus under-exposures;
orthochromatic filters and colour screens with which he was eliminating
undesirable rays, although the chief thing his negatives lacked was
light of any kind. His soiled and stained development trays were
scattered about a large table amidst dirty cups and saucers and plates
and dishes, while at the other end of the table, surmounting a pile of
thumbed and greasy magazines and newspapers, lay the monstrous
mail-order catalogue with pencilled indications of further apparatus to
be purchased.

But his zeal and enthusiasm and resolute riding of his hobby were very
attractive. If he ever gets out of his head the notion that success
depends upon apparatus he will doubtless become a photographer of sorts.
Enthusiasm of any kind other than mining and "mushing" enthusiasm is so
rare in this land that it is welcome even when it seems wasted. He had
recently discovered the wax match in his catalogue, and as a parting
gift he presented me with a box of "them there wax _vespers_ which beats
the sulphur match all to thunder."

[Sidenote: THE SULPHUR MATCH]

But they do not. Nothing in this country can take the place of the
old-fashioned sulphur match, long since banished from civilised
communities, and the sulphur match is the only match a man upon the
trail will employ. Manufactured from blocks of wood without complete
severance, so that the ends of the matches are still held together at
the bottom in one solid mass, it is easy to strip one off at need and
strike it upon the block. A block of a hundred such matches will take up
much less space than fifty of any other kind of match, and the blocks
may be freely carried in any as they are commonly carried in every
pocket without fear of accidental ignition. The only fire producer that
it is worth while supplementing the sulphur match with is the even
older-fashioned flint and steel, which to a man who smokes is a
convenience in a wind. All the modern alcohol and gasoline pocket
devices are extinguished by the lightest puff of wind, but the tinder,
once ignited, burns the fiercer for the blast. With dry, shredded
birch-bark I have made a fire upon occasion from the flint and steel.
One resource may here be mentioned, since we are on the subject, which
is always carried in the hind-sack of my sled against difficulty in fire
making. It is a tin tobacco-box filled with strips of cotton cloth cut
to the size of the box and the whole saturated with kerosene. One or two
of these strips will help very greatly in kindling a fire when damp
twigs or shavings are all that are at hand. A few camphor balls (the
ordinary "moth balls") will serve equally well; and there may come a
time, on any long journey, when the forethought that has provided such
aid will be looked back upon with very great satisfaction.

The mail trail from Tanana to Fairbanks touches the Tanana River only at
one point, a few miles beyond the Hot Springs; but, as we wished to
visit Nenana, we had to leave the mail trail after two days more of
uneventful travel and strike out to the river and over its surface for
seventeen or eighteen miles.

[Sidenote: A NOTABLE GENTLEWOMAN]

Nenana is a native village situated on the left bank of the Tanana, a
little above the confluence of the Nenana River with that stream, and we
have established an important and flourishing school there which
receives its forty pupils from many points on the Yukon and Tanana
Rivers. None but thoroughly sound and healthy children of promise, full
natives or half-breeds, are received at the school, and we seek to give
both boys and girls opportunity for the cultivation of the native arts
and for some of the white man's industrial training, in addition to the
ordinary work of the schoolroom. The school was started and had the good
fortune of its first four years' life under the care of a notable
gentlewoman, Miss Annie Cragg Farthing, who was yet at its head at the
time of this visit, but who died suddenly, a martyr to her devotion to
the children, a year later; and a great Celtic cross in concrete,
standing high on the bluff across the river, now marks the spot of her
own selection--a spot that gives a fine view of Denali--where her body
rests, and also the Alaskan mission's sense of the extraordinary value
of her life.

It would be easy to give striking instances of the potency and stretch
of this remarkable woman's influence amongst the native people, an
influence--strange as it may sound to those who deem any half-educated,
under-bred white woman competent to take charge of an Indian school--due
as much to her wide culture, her perfect dignity and self-possession,
her high breeding, as to the love and consecrated enthusiasm of her
character. It is no exaggeration to say that Miss Farthing's work has
left a mark broad and deep upon the Indian race of this whole region
that will never be wiped out.

There is no greater pleasure than to spend a few days at this school; to
foregather again with so many of the hopeful young scamps that one has
oneself selected here and there and brought to the place; to mark the
improvement in them, the taming and gentling, the drawing out of the
sweet side of the nature that is commonly buried to the casual observer
in the rudeness and shyness of savage childhood. To romp with them, to
tell them tales and jingles, to get insensibly back into their familiar
confidence again, to say the evening prayers with them, to join with
their clear, fresh voices in the hymns and chants, is indeed to
rejuvenate oneself. And to go away believing that real strength of
character is developing, that real preparation is making for an Indian
race that shall be a better Indian race and not an imitation white race,
is the cure for the discouragement that must sometimes come to all those
who are committed heart and soul to the cause of the Alaskan native.
School-teachers, it would seem, ought never to grow old; they should
suck in new youth continually from the young life around them; and
children are far and away the most interesting things in the world, more
interesting even than dogs and great mountains.

[Sidenote: CHIVALROUS INDIAN YOUTH]

All the boys in the school, I think, swarmed across the river with us
when we started away early in the morning, and the elder ones ran with
the sled along the portage, mile after mile, until I turned them back
lest they be late for school.

But when they were gone, still I saw them, saw them gathered round the
grey-haired lady I had left, fawning upon her with their eyes, their
hearts filled with as true chivalry as ever animated knight or champion
of the olden time. Tall, upstanding fellows of sixteen or seventeen,
clean-limbed and broad-shouldered, wild-run all their lives; hunters,
with a tale of big game to the credit of some of them would make an
English sportsman envious; unaccustomed to any restraint at all and
prone to chafe at the slightest; unaccustomed to any respect for women,
to any of the courtesies of life, I saw them fly at a word, at a look,
to do her bidding, saw cap snatched from head if they encountered her
about the buildings, saw them jump up and hold open the door if she
moved to pass out of a room, saw the eager devotion that would have
served her upon bended knee had they thought it would please her. It was
wonderful, the only thing of quite its kind I had ever seen in my life.

When early in the school's history an old medicine-man at Nenana had
been roused to animosity by her refusal to countenance an offensive
Indian custom touching the adolescent girls, and had defiantly announced
his intention to make medicine against her, I can see her now, her staff
in her hand, attended by two or three of her devoted youths, invading
the midnight pavilion of the conjurer, in the very midst of his
conjurations, tossing his paraphernalia outside, laying her staff
smartly across the shoulders of the trembling shaman, and driving the
gaping crew helter-skelter before her, their awe of the witchcraft
overawed by her commanding presence. I make no apology that I thought of
the scourge of small cords that was used on an occasion in the temple at
Jerusalem, when I heard of it. It gave a shrewder blow to the lingering
tyrannical superstition of the medicine-man than decades of preaching
and reasoning would have done. No man living could have done the thing
with like effect, nor any woman save one of her complete self-possession
and natural authority. The younger villagers chuckle over the jest of it
to this day, and the old witch-doctor himself was crouching at her feet
and, as one may say, eating out of her hand, within the year.

I saw these boys again, in my mind's eye, gone back to their homes here
and there on the Yukon and the Tanana after their two or three years at
this school, carrying with them some better ideal of human life than
they could ever get from the elders of the tribe, from the little sordid
village trader, from most of the whites they would be thrown with,
keeping something of the vision of gentle womanhood, something of the
"unbought grace of life," something of the keen sense of truth and
honour, of the nobility of service, something deeper and stronger than
mere words of the love of God, which they had learned of her whom they
all revered; each one, however much overflowed again by the surrounding
waters of mere animal living, tending a little shrine of sweeter and
better things in his heart.

[Sidenote: LONG-REMEMBERED TEACHING]

Here, three years after the visit and the journey narrated, when these
words are written with diaries and letters and memoranda around me, I am
just come from a long native powwow, a meeting of all the Indians of a
village for the annual election of a village council, important in the
evolution of that self-government we covet for these people, but
undeniably tedious. And, because at our missions we seek to associate
with us every force that looks to the betterment of the natives, we had
invited the new government teacher, a lady of long experience in Indian
schools, to be present. She had sat patiently through the protracted
meeting, and at its close, when she rose to go, a young Indian man
jumped up and held her fur cloak for her and put it gently about her
shoulders. When she had thanked him she asked with a smile: "Where did
you learn to be so polite?" A gleam came into the fellow's eyes, then he
dropped them and replied, "Miss Farthing taught me."

Two days before, returning from a journey, I had spent the night at a
road-house kept by a white man married to an Indian woman. There was
excellent yeast bread on the table, and good bread is a rare thing in
Alaska. "Where did you learn to make such good bread?" I inquired of the
woman. There came the same light to her eyes and the same answer to her
lips. Yet it was nine years ago, long before the school at Nenana was
started, that this Indian boy and girl had been under Miss Farthing's
teaching at Circle City.

They tell us there is no longer much place or use for gentility in the
world, for men and women nurtured and refined above the common level;
tell us in particular that woman is only now emancipating herself from
centuries of ineffectual nonage, only now entering upon her active
career.

Yet I am of opinion, from such opportunities to observe and compare as
my constant travel has given me, that the quiet work of this gracious
woman of the old school, with her dignity that nothing ever invaded and
her poise that nothing ever disturbed, is perhaps the most powerful
single influence that has come into the lives of the natives of interior
Alaska.

Two days brought us past the little native village and mission at Chena
(which is pronounced Shen-aẁ), past the little white town of the same
name, to Fairbanks, the chief town of interior Alaska. Chena is at the
virtual head of the navigation of the Tanana River and is quite as near
to the gold-producing creeks as Fairbanks, which latter place is not on
the Tanana River at all but on a slough, impracticable for almost any
craft at low water. For every topographical reason, from every
consideration of natural advantage, Chena should have been the river
port and town of these gold-fields. But Chena was so sure of her
manifold natural advantages that she became unduly confident and
grasping. When the traders at Fairbanks offered to remove to Chena at
the beginning of the camp, if the traders at Chena would provide a site,
the offer was scornfully rejected. "They would have to come, anyway, or
go out of business." But they did not come; rather they put their backs
up and fought. And because Fairbanks was enterprising and far-sighted,
while Chena was avaricious and narrow, because Fairbanks offered free
sites and Chena charged enormously for water-front, business went the
ten miles up the often unnavigable slough and settled there, and by and
by built a little railway that it might be independent of the uncertain
boat service. The company came, the courts came, the hospital came, the
churches came, and Chena woke up from its dreams of easy wealth to find
itself and its manifold natural advantages passed by and ignored and the
big town firmly established elsewhere.

How well I remember the virulent little newspaper published at Chena in
those days and the bitterness and vituperation it used to pour out week
by week! One wishes a file of it had been preserved. Alaskan journalism
has presented many amusing curiosities that no one has had leisure to
collect, but nothing more amusing than the frenzy of impotent wrath
Chena vented when it saw its cherished prospects and opportunities
slipping out of its grasp for ever.

        "If of all words on tongue or pen,
         The saddest are 'it might have been,'
         Full sad are those we often see,
         It is, but it hadn't ought to be."

It takes Bret Harte to strike the note for such rivalry and such
disappointment.

FOOTNOTES:

[C] In December, 1912, a determined effort was made by the better
element of the little handful of white people in this town to secure the
withdrawal of the licence of this saloon. The justice of the peace, the
government school-teacher, the postmaster, and others went up to
Fairbanks (a week's journey over the trail) and opposed the granting of
the licence in court. It was shown that the white men of the locality
were so reduced in numbers that the business could not be carried on at
a profit unless liquor was sold, directly or indirectly, to the Indians.
But because by hook and by crook the names of a majority of one or two
of all the white residents of the precinct were secured for a petition
in favour of the licence (two or three were secured by telegraph at the
last moment) the judge held that he had no option under the law but to
grant the licence. So, on the one hand, it is a felony to sell liquor to
Indians, and annually thousands of dollars are expended in trying to
suppress such sale, while, on the other hand, a man is licenced to sell
liquor when it is shown that he cannot make a living unless he sells to
Indians; that is to say he is virtually granted a licence to sell to
Indians. This note is not intended to reflect upon the judge who granted
the licence, although all his predecessors have not put that
construction upon the law, but upon a law open to that construction.

CHAPTER IX

TANANA CROSSING TO FORTYMILE AND DOWN THE YUKON--A PATRIARCHAL
CHIEF--SWARMING CARIBOU--EAGLE AND FORT EGBERT--CIRCLE CITY AND FORT
YUKON


FAIRBANKS was a different place in 1910 from the centre of feverish
trade and feverish vice of 1904-5, when the stores were open all day and
half the night and the dance-halls and gambling dens all night and half
the day; when the Jews cornered all the salt and all the sugar in the
camp and the gamblers all the silver and currency; when the curious
notion prevailed that in some mysterious way general profligacy was good
for business, and the Commercial Club held an indignation meeting upon a
threat of closing down the public gaming and refusing liquor licences to
the dance-halls, and voted unanimously in favour of an "open town"; when
a diamond star was presented to the "chief of police" by the enforced
contributions of the prostitutes; when the weekly gold-dust from the
clean-ups on the creeks came picturesquely into town escorted by
horsemen armed to the teeth. The outward and visible signs of the Wild
West are gone; the dance-halls and gambling tables are a thing of the
past; the creeks are all connected with Fairbanks by railway and
telephone; an early closing movement has prevailed in the shops; and
the local choral society is lamenting the customary dearth of tenors for
its production of "The Messiah."

Despite the steady decline in the gold output of late years, a drop of
from twenty millions down to four or five, there is little visible decay
in its trade, and despite stampedes to new diggings all over Alaska,
there is no marked visible diminution in its population, though as a
matter of fact both must have largely fallen off. The thing that more
than any other has sustained the spirits and retained the presence of
the business men is the expectation that seems to grow brighter and
brighter, of the development of a quartz camp now that the placers are
being exhausted. And in that hope lies the chance of Fairbanks to become
the one permanent considerable town of interior Alaska. It is a
substantial place, with good business houses and many comfortable homes
electric-lit, steam-heated, well protected against fire--better than
against flood--and, though it does not display the style and luxury of
the palmy days of Nome, it has amenities enough to make disinterested
visitors and passers-by wish that its hard-rock hopes may be realised.

[Sidenote: FAIRBANKS]

The little log church that is still, as a local artist put it, "the only
thing in Fairbanks worth making a picture of," no longer stands open all
day and all night as the town's library and reading-room, but has
withdrawn into decorous Sabbath use in favour of the commodious public
library built by a Philadelphia churchman; the hospital adjoining it,
that for two or three years cared for all the sick of the camp, is
supplemented by another and a larger across the slough; young
birch-trees have been successfully planted all along the principal
streets, and the front yards everywhere are ablaze with flowers the
summer through. You may eat hot-house lettuce and radishes in March;
hot-house strawberries (at about ten cents apiece) in July and August;
while common outdoor garden-truck of all kinds is plentiful and good in
its short season.

We had another canine misfortune while we lay there. Doc, one of our
leaders, got his chain twisted around his foot the night before we were
to leave, and, in pulling to free it, stopped the circulation of the
blood and the foot froze. It was as hard as wood and sounded like wood
when it hit the sidewalks, from which the snow had been cleared, as the
dog came limping along. An hour's soaking in cold water drew the frost
out of the foot, and we swathed it in cotton saturated with carron oil,
upon which it swelled so greatly that it was impossible to tell the
extent of the injury or to determine whether or not the dog would ever
be of use again. A kindly nurse at the hospital undertook his care, and
we left him behind. One does not buy a dog so late in the season, with
all the idle summer to feed him through, if any shift can be made to
avoid it, and there was a Great Dane pup at the Salchaket, forty miles
away, that I might pick up as I passed and perhaps make some use of for
the remainder of the winter.

That mission was the next stop on our journey, and we reached it over
the level mail trail, the chief winter highway of Alaska, connecting
Fairbanks with Valdez on the coast. Three times a week there is a horse
stage with mail and passengers passing over this trail each way,
together with much other travel. The Alaska Road Commission has lavished
large sums of money upon it, and the four hundred miles or thereabout is
made in a week.

[Sidenote: THE SALCHAKET]

A day and a half brought us to the Salchaket, one of a chain of missions
along the Tanana River, established by the energy and zeal of the
Reverend Charles Eugene Betticher, Jr., during his incumbency at
Fairbanks, that have already brought a great change for the better in
native conditions. Five years had elapsed since last I visited this
tribe, a reconnoitring visit on one of the first steamboats that ever
went up the Tanana River above Fairbanks, and it was a delight to see
the new, clean village with the little gardens round the cabins, and to
note the appreciative attitude which the Indians showed. So highly do
they value the missionary nurse in charge that however far afield their
hunting may lead them, one of their number is sent back every week to
see that the mission does not lack wood and water and meat; a simple,
docile, kindly people that one's heart warms to.

This mission was our last outpost to the south. My farther journey had
for its prime object the visiting of the natives of the upper Tanana as
far as the Tanana Crossing, some two hundred and fifty miles beyond the
Salchaket, the inquiring into their condition and into the desirability
of establishing a post amongst them.

[Sidenote: THE UPPER TANANA]

The upper Tanana is probably one of the most difficult streams in the
world to navigate that can by any stretch of the term be called
navigable. The great Alaskan range begins to approach the Tanana River
so soon as one gets above Fairbanks. Its prominent peaks, ten thousand
to twelve thousand feet high, are continually in view from one angle to
another as one pursues the river trail, and come constantly nearer and
nearer. All the streams that are confluent with the Tanana on its left
bank are glacial streams draining the high ice of these mountains. They
come down laden thick with silt, at times foaming torrents, at times
merely trickling watercourses that seam with numerous small runnels the
wide deltas at their mouths. The tributaries of the right bank flow for
the most part through heavily wooded country, and come out cleanly into
the river. So the glacial waters form shoals and bars, and the woodland
waters during freshets pile them high with driftwood. Such is the chief
characteristic of the upper Tanana; a multiplicity of swift, narrow
channels amidst bars laden with drift. It is subject to sudden rises of
great violence; the attempt to stem a freshet on the upper Tanana is a
hair-raising experience as the log of the _Pelican_ would show, but does
not come within this narrative. Owing to the origin of much of its
water, the Tanana is often in flood in dry, hot seasons, when other
rivers run meagrely, as well as in times of rain. It cannot be stemmed
in flood; its shoals deny passage in drouth; there must be just the
right stage of water to permit its navigation, and that stage, "without
o'erflowing, full," is not often found of duration to serve the voyage
after the month of June.

A river difficult to navigate in summer is usually a river difficult to
travel upon in winter, and the upper Tanana is notoriously dangerous and
treacherous. Scarce a winter or a summer that it does not claim victims.
It is emphatically a "bad river." Therefore, as far as there is any
travel to speak of, land trails parallel the river. Past Richardson
where the next night is spent, a decayed mining and trading town that
dates back to the stampedes of 1905-6 when it was thought the upper
Tanana would prove rich in gold, past Tenderfoot Creek on which the
discoveries were made, past the mouth of the Big Delta with the great
bluff on the opposite shore and the rushing black water at its foot that
never entirely closes all the winter, and on the other hand the wide
barrens of the Big Delta itself giving the whole fine sweep of the
Alaskan range, we came at length to McCarthy's, the last telegraph
station on the river,--for the line strikes across country thence to
Valdez following the government trail,--and there spent another night,
and here we leave the government-made trail and take to the river
surface and the wilderness.

[Illustration: A PLEASANT WOODLAND TRAIL.]

[Illustration: AN ALASKAN CHIEF AND HIS HENCHMAN.]

Twelve miles through the woods along the left bank of the river brought
us to the aptly named Clearwater Creek, a tributary that comes only from
the foot-hills and carries no glacial water. This stream by reason of
hot springs runs wide open all the winter and must be crossed by a
ferry--a raft on a heavy wire. The man who owned the ferry and the house
adjacent was gone from home, so we proceeded to cross as best we could.
The raft was so small that first we took the dogs across then unloaded
the sled and took part of the load, and returned for the remainder
and the sled itself. Finally a canoe was loaded on the raft and, when it
had been moored on the side we found it, Arthur paddled himself back. It
was a strange scene, rafting and paddling a canoe in interior Alaska on
the 2d of March, with the thermometer at -15°. Some eight miles farther
along the portage trail we came to a little cabin about dusk, but
disdaining its dirt and darkness we pitched our tent.

Another eighteen miles the next day is noted in my diary for pleasant
woodland travel and for the particular interest of the numerous animal
tracks we passed. Here a moose had crossed the trail, ploughing through
the snow like a great cart-horse; here for two or three miles a lynx had
urgent business in the direction of the Healy River. A lynx will always
follow a trail if there be one, and will pick out the best going on the
ice or snow in the absence of trail. I once followed a lynx track from
the head of the Dall River to its mouth, and, save for turning aside
occasionally to investigate a clump of willows or brush, the lynx was an
excellent guide. Here were rabbit tracks and every now and then the
little sharp tracks of a squirrel. We stopped for lunch under a tall
cottonwood-tree, and Arthur pointed out that the trunk, up to a high
crotch, was all seamed by bear claws. He said that the black bear
climbed the same tree season after season, and told me that, according
to the Indians, this was chiefly done when first he came from his winter
den,--for the purpose of getting his bearings, as the boy suggested with
a chuckle. A fox, a marten, and a weasel had all passed across lately,
and of course then came the exclamation that scarce fails from native
lips when a fox track is seen: "I wonder if it were a black fox!" A
black fox means sudden wealth beyond the dreams of avarice to an Indian,
and any fox track may be the track of a black fox.

The end of that portage brought us out on the Tanana River opposite the
little trading-post at the mouth of the Healy--the last post of any kind
we should see.

[Sidenote: INDIAN TRADERS]

The trader, by whom we were hospitably entertained, had heard of our
projected occupation of the upper Tanana, and alert to his own
interests, was anxious to know the plans for the establishment of a
mission--plans which were yet all to make. He naturally favoured this
spot, which it was already plain was quite out of the question, but
professed his readiness to move to any place that we might decide upon,
and his entire sympathy and co-operation.

The question of the trader, which always arises upon the establishment
of a new mission site, is an important and sometimes a vexatious one,
for he wields an influence amongst the Indians second only to that of
the mission itself, and may be either a great help or a great hindrance.
There is a natural desire to secure a man of character for the new post,
and at the same time a natural reluctance to disturb vested interests
and arouse bitter enmity by diverting trade. The suggestion has often
been made that the mission should itself undertake a store in the
interest of the natives, but those with most experience in such matters
will agree that it is the wisdom of the bishop that sets his face
against mission trading. The two offices are so essentially dissimilar
as to be almost incompatible with one another; either the person in
charge is a missionary first and a trader afterwards, in which case the
store suffers, or he is a trader first and a missionary afterwards, in
which case he is not a missionary at all. A clean, sober, and honest
trader, content to take his time about getting rich, is a blessing to an
Indian community. There are some such, one thinks, but they are not
numerous. The profits are large, though the turnover is but one a year;
the capital required is small; it is a life with much leisure; but in
the main it attracts only a certain class of men.

A band of Indians to whom word of our visit had been sent had come down
the river this far to meet us and escort us, but dog food was scarce and
our arrival was delayed, and they had been compelled to return to their
hunting camp whither we must follow them. We were now farther up the
Tanana River than either of us had ever been before; the country had the
fascination of a new country; every bend of the river held unknown
possibilities, and the keenness and elation that only the penetration of
a new country brings were upon the boy as well as upon myself.

The river and the mountains were already drawn much closer together, and
as we pursued our journey upon the one we had continual fine views of
the other. The going was good--too good--for much of it was new ice and
spoke of recent overflow, and all too soon we came upon the water. At
the mouth of the Johnson River, one of the glacial streams, the whole
river was overflowed, and we waded for a mile through water that
deepened continually until there was risk of wetting our load. Then we
were compelled to take to the woods and to cut a portage around the
worst and deepest of it, and so passed beyond it to good ice and to an
empty cabin where we spent the night, glad to be sheltered from an
exceedingly bitter wind that had blown all day and had taken all the
pleasure out of travel.

[Sidenote: THE THERMOS BOTTLES]

It is in such weather particularly that the thermos flasks prove such a
boon to the musher. To stop and build a fire in the wind means to get
chilled through. There is no pleasure in it at all, and I would rather
push on until the day's journey is done. But the native boy must have
his lunch, and will build a fire in any sort of weather and make a pot
of tea. The thermos bottle, with its boiling-hot cocoa, gives one the
stimulation and nourishment that are desired without stopping for more
than a few moments. I have carried a pair of these bottles all day at
60° below zero, and, when opened, snow had to be put into the cocoa
before it was cool enough to drink. Of course it is perfectly
simple--all the astonishing things are--but I never open one of those
bottles in the cold weather and pour out its contents without marvelling
at it.

We left the river and struck inland towards the foot-hills of the
Alaskan range, a long, rough journey over a trail that had been made by
the band that came out to the Healy to meet us, and had been travelled
no more than by their coming and going. The snow in this region had been
as much lighter than usual as the snow in the Koyukuk had been heavier.
Through the tangle of prostrate trunks of a burned-over forest and the
dense underbrush that follows such a fire, with not enough snow to give
smooth passage over the obstacles, we made our toilsome way, the labour
of the dogs calling for the continual supplement of the men, one at the
gee pole and one at the handle-bars. Some twenty miles, perhaps, a long
day's continuous journey, we pushed laboriously into the hills and then
pitched our tent; but in a few miles, next morning, we had struck the
main Indian trail from the village near the Tanana Crossing, by which
the hunting party had come, and what little was left of the journey went
easily enough until we reached the considerable native encampment.

The men were all gone after moose save one half-naked, blear-eyed old
paralytic, a dreadful creature who shambled and hobbled up asking for
tobacco. The women were expecting us, however, and took the encamping
out of our hands entirely, setting up the tent, hauling stove wood and
splitting it up, making our couch of spruce boughs, starting a fire, and
bringing a plentiful present of moose and caribou meat for ourselves and
our dogs. Nothing could have been kinder than our reception; the full
hospitality of the wilderness was heaped upon us. It was not until dark
that the men returned, and we had all the afternoon to get acquainted
with the women and children. Already the chief difficulty we had to
encounter presented itself. These people did not speak the language of
the lower Tanana and middle Yukon--Arthur's language--at all. Their
speech had much more affinity with the upper Yukon language, and it
dawned upon me that they were not of the migration that had pushed up
the Tanana River from the Yukon, as all the natives as far as the
Salchaket certainly did, were not of that tribe or that movement at all,
but had come across country by the Ketchumstock from the neighbourhood
of Eagle--the route we should return to the Yukon by--and were of the
Porcupine and Peel River stock. This was certainly a surprise; I had
deemed all the Tanana River Indians of the same extraction and tongue,
but the stretch of bad water from the Salchaket to the Tanana Crossing
was evidently the boundary between two peoples.

[Sidenote: CHIEF ISAAC]

That night we met Chief Isaac and the principal men of his tribe. At
first it seemed that such broken English as three or four of them had
would be our only medium of intercourse, but later one was discovered
who had visited the lower Tanana and the Yukon and who understood Arthur
indifferently well, and by the double interpretation, halting and
inefficient, but growing somewhat better as we proceeded, it was
possible to enter into communication. These preliminaries arranged, the
chief made a set speech of dignity and force. He thanked me for coming
to them, and regretted he had not been able to wait longer at the Healy
River to help us to his camp. When he was a boy he had been across to
the Yukon and had seen Bishop Bompas, and had been taught and baptized
by him, but he was an old man now and he had forgotten what he had
learned. I was the first minister most of his people had ever seen. They
heard that Indians in other places had mission and school, and they had
felt sorry a long time that no one came to teach them; for they were
very ignorant, little children who knew nothing, and when they heard a
rumour that a mission and school would be brought to them their hearts
were very glad. Wherever we should see fit to "make mission," there he
and his people would go, and would help build for us and help us in
every way; but he hoped it would be near Lake Mansfield and the
Crossing, where most of them lived at present. Farther down the river
was not so good for their hunting and fishing, but they would go
wherever we said. That was the burden of the chief's speech.

I took a liking to the old man at once. He was evidently a chief that
was a chief. The chieftainship here was plainly not the effete and
decaying institution it is in many places on the Yukon. He spoke for all
his people without hesitation or question, and one felt that what he
said was law amongst them.

There followed for two days an almost continuous course of instruction
in the elements of the Christian faith and Christian morals, all day
long and far into the night, with no more interval than cooking and
eating required. In the largest tent of the encampment, packed full of
men and women, the children wedged in where they could get, myself
seated on a pile of robes and skins, my interpreters at my side, my
hearers squatted on the spruce boughs of the floor, the instruction went
on. As it proceeded, the interpretation improved, though it was still
difficult and clumsy, as speaking through two minds and two mouths must
always be. Whenever I stopped there was urgent request to go on, until
at last my voice was almost gone with incessant use. Over and over the
same things I went; the cardinal facts of religion--the Incarnation, the
Crucifixion, the Resurrection, the Ascension; the cardinal laws of
morality--the prohibition of murder, adultery, theft, and falsehood;
that something definite might be left behind that should not be lost in
the vagueness of general recollection, and always with the insistence
that this was God's world and not the devil's world, a world in which
good should ultimately prevail in spite of all opposition.

[Sidenote: SAVAGE, HEATHEN, PAGAN]

It is at once a high privilege and a solemn responsibility to deal with
souls to whom the appeal of the Christian religion had never before been
made, as were most of my hearers. One cannot call them "heathen." One
never thinks of these Alaskan natives as heathen. "Savage" and "heathen"
and "pagan" all meant, of course, in their origin, just country people,
and point to some old-time, tremendous superciliousness of the
city-bred, long since disappeared, except, perhaps, from such places as
Whitechapel and the Bowery. A savage is simply a forest dweller, a
heathen a heath dweller, and for a large part of each year I come,
etymologically, within the terms myself. But with its ordinary
implication of ferocity and bloodthirstiness it is absurd to apply the
word "savage" to the mild and gentle Alaskan Indian, and, with its
ordinary implication of bowing down to wood and stone, it is misleading
to apply the term "heathen" to those who never made any sort of graven
image.

Much has been written, and cleverly written, about the Alaskan Indian
that is preposterously untrue. Arthur, my half-breed boy, had recently
been reading a story by Jack London, dealing with the Indians in the
vicinity of Tanana, where he was bred and born, and his indignation at
the representation of his people in this story was amusing. The story
was called _The Wit of Porportuk_, and it presented a native chief in
almost baronial state, with slaves waiting upon him in a large
banqueting hall and I know not what accumulated wealth of furs and gold.
Such pictures are far more flagrantly untrue to any conditions that ever
existed in Alaska than anything Fenimore Cooper wrote about the Five
Nations. There were never any slaves in the interior; there was never
any wealth amongst the Indians; there was never any state and
circumstance of life. And the more one lives amongst them and knows
them, the less one believes that they could ever have been a warlike
people, despite their own traditions. Sporadic forays, fostered by their
ignorant dread of one another or stirred up by rival medicine-men, there
may have been between different tribes--and there certainly were between
the Indians and the Esquimaux--with ambuscade and slaughter of isolated
hunting parties that ventured too far beyond the confines of their own
territory; and one such affair would furnish tradition for generations
to dilate upon. I have myself found all the men of Nulato gone scouting,
or hiding--I could not determine which--in the hills with their guns,
upon a rumour that the "Huskies," or Esquimaux, were coming; I have
known the Indians of the Yukon and the Tanana, and as far as the
Koyukuk, excited and alarmed over the friendly visit of a handful of
ragged natives from the Copper River to Nenana at Christmas time,
although in either case it must certainly have been fifty years since
there was any actual hostile incursion, and probably much longer.

[Sidenote: A GENTLE, TIMID PEOPLE]

They are a very timid people, and an exceedingly peaceable people. Years
and years may be spent amongst them without knowledge of a single act of
violence between Indian men; they do not quarrel and fight. Bold enough
in the chase, willing to face dangers of ice and water and wild beast,
they have a dread of anything like personal encounter, and will submit
to a surprising amount of imposition and overbearing on the part of a
white man without resorting to it. I knew a certain white man who
claimed a whole river valley north of the Yukon as his, who warned off
hunting parties of Indians who ventured upon it, and made them give up
game killed in "his territory." They came to the mission and complained
about it, but they never withstood the usurper. It ought to be added
that it always appeared more as the making good of a practical joke than
as a serious pretension, but the point is--the Indians submitted.

So far as these natives of the interior are concerned they were never
idolaters. I cannot find that they had any distinct notion of worship at
all. Their religion had root in a certain frantic terror of the unknown,
and found expression in ceaseless efforts to propitiate the malign
spirits surrounding them on every side. Thus they were given over to the
mastery of those amongst them who had the traditional art of such
propitiation, and fell more or less completely under that cruellest and
most venal of sways, the tyranny of the witch-doctor. It is impossible
to doubt, and hard to exaggerate, the grinding and brutal exactions to
which this rule led. Anything that a man possessed might be demanded and
must be yielded, on pain of disease and death, even to the whole
season's catch of fur or the deflowering of a young daughter. The utmost
greed and lust that can disgrace humanity found its Indian expression in
the lives of some of these medicine-men.

Since every sort of tyranny has its vulnerable spot, since the despotism
of Russia was tempered by assassination and of Japan by the effect of
public suicide, so melioration of the tyranny of the medicine-man seems
to have been found in rivalry amongst members of the craft itself.
Oppressed beyond endurance by one practitioner, allegiance would be
transferred to some new claimant of occult powers, and the breaking of
the monopoly of magic would be followed by a temporary lightening of the
burdens. Some of the most lurid of Alaskan legends deal with the
thaumaturgic contests of rival medicine-men, and one judges that sleight
of hand and even hypnotic suggestion were cultivated to a fine point.

To such minds the Christian teaching comes with glad and one may say
instantaneous acceptance. Their attitude is entirely childlike. They are
anxious to be told more and more about it, to be told it over and over
again. There is never the slightest sign of incredulity. It does not
occur to them as possible that a man should be sent all this way to
them, should hunt them up and seek them out to tell it to them, unless
it were true. And one learns over again how universal is the appeal the
Christian religion, and in particular the Life of Our Lord, makes to
mankind. I have seen Indians and Esquimaux mixed, hearing for the first
time the details of the Passion, stirred to as great indignation as was
that barbarian chieftain who laid his hand on his sword and cried,
"Would I and my men had been there!" or those Western cowboys, so the
story runs, bred in illiteracy and irreligion, to whose children a
school-teacher had given an account of the same great events, and who
rode up to the schoolhouse the next day with guns and ropes, and asked:
"Which way did them blamed Jews go?"

The medicine-man lies low; may himself profess acceptance of the new
teaching, may even really accept it (for it is very hard, indeed, to
follow and judge all the mental processes of an Indian)--yes, though it
expressly sweep all his devils away, out of the sick, out of the wind
and storm, from off every grave mound, though it leave him no paltry
net-tearing or trap-springing sprite to work upon with his conjurations;
yet the old superstition dies hard, often crops up when one had thought
it perished, and even sometimes maintains itself, sub rosa, side by side
with definite, regular Christian worship.

[Sidenote: THE OLD, OLD STORY]

The arctic explorer Stefanson, a careful and acute observer who has had
exceptional opportunities for observation of the intimate life of the
Esquimaux, has written much lately of the grafting of Christianity upon
native superstition and the existence of both together, as though it
were some new thing or newly noticed by himself. Yet every one familiar
with the history of Christianity knows that it has characterised the
progress of religion in all ages. There was never a people yet that did
not in great measure do this thing, nor is it reasonable to suppose that
it could have been otherwise. It is impossible to make a _tabula rasa_
of men's minds. It is impossible to uproot customs of immemorial
antiquity without leaving some rootlets behind. And what is acquired
joins itself insensibly to what is retained, and either the incongruity
is hidden beneath a change of nomenclature or is not hidden at all. Our
own social life is threaded through and through with customs and
practices which go back to a superstitious origin. The matter is such a
commonplace of history that it is bootless to labour it here.

A scientist is only a "scientist." How that name tends continually to
depreciate itself as the pursuit of physical science is divorced more
and more completely from a knowledge of literature, from a knowledge of
the humanities! And a scientist is a poor guide to an acquaintance with
man, civilised or uncivilised. To come to the study of any race of man,
even the most primitive, without some knowledge of all the long history
of man, of all the long history of man's thought, man's methods, man's
strivings, man's accomplishments, man's failures, is to come so ill
equipped that no just conclusions are likely to be reached. Your
exclusive "scientist"--and such are most of them to-day--may be
competent to deal with circles and triangles, with wheels and levers
with cells and glands, with germs and bacilli and micro-organisms
generally, with magnetos and dynamos, with all the heavenly host if you
like, but he has no equipment to deal with man! Somatic anthropology in
particular tends to assume in some quarters such an overimportance that
one falls back upon the recollection that the original head measurers
were hatters and that all hatters are proverbially mad. The occupation
would seem to carry the taint.

It was with much pleasure that I was able to hold out hope to Chief
Isaac of the mission and the school he desired so earnestly for his
people. It must not be supposed that all of them were in the completely
unevangelised state which has been dwelt upon, that to all of them the
teaching of those two full days was novel; some of them, like the chief
himself, had been across to the Yukon long ago and still bore some trace
of the early labours of the Church of England missionaries to whom this
region of Alaska that adjoins Canada is so much indebted. Others had
once been to the Ketchumstock, upon the occasion of a visit from our
missionary at Eagle, and had received instruction from him. But there
were many present in that tent who had never seen any missionary, never
had any teaching, to whom it was wholly new save as they might have
picked up some inkling from those that had been more fortunate.

[Illustration: THE TANANA CROSSING.]

[Illustration: GOOD GOING ON THE YUKON.]

[Sidenote: TRIBAL CONNECTIONS]

When we left this encampment Isaac sent two of his young men to guide
us, with a sled drawn by three or four small dogs, so gaily caparisoned
with _tapis_ and ribbons, tinsel, and pompons, that they might have
been circus dogs. Here again is evidence of this tribe's affinity
with the upper Yukon natives, and so with those of the Mackenzie. I
never saw the _tapis_, a broad, bright ornamented cloth that lies upon
the dog's back under his harness, on the Middle Yukon. It is
characteristic of the Peel River Indians who come across by the Rampart
House and La Pierre House.

A few hours' journey brought us to the Tanana River again, which we
crossed, and took a portage on the other side that went up a long defile
and then along a ridge and then down another long defile until at night
we reached the native village at Lake Mansfield; a picturesque spot, for
the lake is entirely surrounded by mountains except on the side which
opens to the river. Here the Alaskan range and the Tanana River have
approached so close that the water almost washes the base of the
foot-hills, and the scenery is as fine and bold as any in Alaska. And
here, at Lake Mansfield, if only there were navigable connection between
the lake and the river into which it drains, would be an admirable place
for a mission station.

A couple of hours next day took us the seven remaining miles to the
Tanana Crossing. Here, at that time, was a station of the military
telegraph connecting Valdez on the coast with Fort Egbert (Eagle) on the
Yukon, a line maintained, at enormous expense, purely for military
purposes. It passed through an almost entirely uninhabited country in
which perhaps scarcely a dozen messages would originate in a year. The
telegraph-line and Fort Egbert itself are now abandoned. Strategic
considerations constitute a vague and variable quantity.

It was strange to find this little station with two or three men of the
signal-corps away out here in the wilderness. Their post was supplied by
mule pack-train from Fort Egbert, more than two hundred miles away, and
they told me that only ten pounds out of every hundred that left Fort
Egbert reached the Crossing, so self-limited is a pack-train through
such country. We amused ourselves calculating just how much farther
mules and men could go until they ate up _all_ they could carry.

The Tanana Crossing is a central spot for the Indians of this region.
Two days' journey up the river was the village of the Tetlin Indians.
Two days' journey into the mountain range were the Mantasta Indians. Two
days' journey across towards the Yukon were the Ketchumstock Indians.
Most of them would congregate at this spot for certain parts of the
year, should we plant a mission there, and despite the picturesque
situation of Lake Mansfield, it looked as if the Crossing were the best
point for building.

[Sidenote: THE TANANA CROSSING]

Our route lay northeast, across country to Fortymile on the Yukon, two
hundred and fifty miles away, along the trail for the greater part of
the distance by which the mule train reached the Tanana Crossing. The
first five miles was all up-hill, a long, stiff, steady climb to the
crest of the mountain that rises just behind the Crossing. We had to
take it slowly, with frequent stops, so steep was the grade, and every
now and then we got tantalising glimpses through the timber of the scene
that spread wider and wider below us. Bend after bend of the Tanana
River unfolded itself; the Alaskan range gave peak after peak; there
lay Lake Mansfield, deep in its amphitheatre of hills, with the Indian
village at its head.

At last my impatience for the view that promised made me leave the boys
(we still had Isaac's young men) and push on alone to the top. And it
was indeed by far the noblest view of the winter, one of the grandest
and most extensive panoramas I had ever seen in my life.

Perhaps three miles away, as the crow flies, from the river, and
seventeen hundred and fifty feet above it, as the aneroid gave it, we
were already on the watershed, and everywhere in the direction we were
travelling the wide-flung draws and gullies of the Fortymile River
stretched out, so clear and beautiful a display of the beginnings of a
great drainage system that my attention was arrested, notwithstanding my
eagerness for the sight that awaited my turning around. But it was upon
turning around and looking in the direction from which we had come that
the grandeur and sublimity entered into the scene. There was, indeed, no
one great dominating feature in this prospect as in the view of Denali
from the Rampart portage, but the whole background, bounding the vision
completely, was one vast wall of lofty white peaks, stretching without a
break for a hundred miles. Enormous cloud masses rose and fell about
this barrier, now unfolding to reveal dark chasms and glittering
glaciers, now enshrouding them again. In the middle distance the Tanana
River wound and twisted its firm white line amidst broken patches of
snow and timber far away to either hand, and, where glacial affluents
discharged into it, were finer, threadlike lines that marked the many
mouths. The thick spruce mantling the slope in the foreground gave a
sombre contrast to the fields of snow, and the yellow March sunshine was
poured over all the wide landscape save where the great clouds contended
with the great mountains.

The boys had stopped to build a fire and brew some tea before leaving
the timber, and I was glad of it, for it gave me the chance to gaze my
fill upon the inspiring and fascinating scene in the pleasant warmth of
the mountain top, with the thermometer at 30° in the shade and just 12°
higher in the sunshine.

[Sidenote: A NOBLE VIEW]

How grateful I was for the clear bright day! What a disappointment it
has been again and again to reach such an eminence and see--nothing! It
was the most extensive view of the great Alaskan range I had ever
secured--that long line of sharp peaks that stretches and broadens from
the coast inland until it culminates in the highest point of the North
American continent and then curves its way back to the coast again. Of
course, what lay here within the vision was only a small part of one arm
of the range; it stopped far short of Denali on the one hand and Mount
Sanford on the other, though it included Mount Kimball and Mount Hayes;
yet it was the most impressive sight of a mountain chain I had ever
beheld. It was a sight to be glad and grateful for, to put high amongst
one's joyful remembrances; and with this notable sight we bade farewell
to the Tanana valley.

Down the hill we went into Fortymile water and into a rolling country
crossed by the military mule trail. If the morning had been glorious the
evening was full of penance. Long before night our feet were sore from
slipping and sliding into those wretched mule tracks. One cannot take
one's eyes from the trail for a moment, every footstep must be watched,
and even then one is continually stumbling.

We were able, however, to rig our team with the double hitch that is so
much more economical of power than the tandem hitch, whenever the width
of the trail permits it. We now carry a convertible rig, so that on
narrow trails or in deep snow we can string out the dogs one in front of
the other, and when the trail is wide enough can hitch them side by
side. "Seal," the Great Dane pup we got at the Salchaket, was a good and
strong puller, but he had no coat and no sense. It is bad enough to have
no coat in this country, but to have no coat and no sense is fatal--as
he found. His feet were continually sore and he had to be specially
provided for at night if it were at all cold--a dog utterly unsuited to
Alaska.

Thirty miles of such going as has been described is tiring in the
extreme, and when we reached the Lone Cabin, behold! fifteen Indians
camped about it, for whom, when supper was done, followed two hours of
teaching and the baptism of six children. I would have liked to have
stayed a day with them, but if we were to spend Palm Sunday at Fortymile
and Easter at Eagle as had been promised, the time remaining did no more
than serve; and there was a large band of Indians to visit at
Ketchumstock.

The next day took us into and across the Ketchumstock Flats, a wide
basin surrounded by hills and drained by the Mosquito Fork of the
Fortymile. The telegraph-line, supported on tripods against the summer
yielding of the marshy soil, cuts straight across country. This basin
and the hills around form one of the greatest caribou countries,
perhaps, in the world. All day we had passed fragments of the long
fences that were in use in times past by the Indians for driving the
animals into convenient places for slaughter.

The annual migration of the vast herd that roams the section of Alaska
between the Yukon and the Tanana Rivers swarms over this Flat and
through these hills, and we were told at the Ketchumstock telegraph
station by the signal-corps men that they estimated that upward of one
hundred thousand animals crossed the Mosquito Fork the previous October.

[Sidenote: CARIBOU]

The big game of Alaska is not yet seriously diminished, though there was
need for the legal protection that has of late years been given. It is
probable that more caribou and young moose are killed every year by
wolves than by hunters. Only in the neighbourhood of a considerable
settlement is there danger of reckless and wasteful slaughter, and some
attention is paid by game wardens to the markets of such places. The
mountain-sheep stands in greater danger of extermination than either
caribou or moose. Its meat, the most delicious mutton in the world, as
it has been pronounced by epicures, brings a higher price than other
wild meat, and it is easy to destroy a band completely. The sheep on the
mountains of the Alaskan range nearest to Fairbanks have, it is said,
been very greatly diminished, and that need not be wondered at when one
sees sled load after sled load, aggregating several tons of meat,
brought in at one shipment. The law protecting the sheep probably needs
tightening up.

The big game is a great resource to all the people of the country, white
and native. It is no small advantage to be able to take one's gun in the
fall and go out in the valleys and kill a moose that will suffice for
one man's meat almost the whole winter, or go into the hills and kill
four or five caribou that will stock his larder equally well. The fresh,
clean meat of the wilds has to most palates far finer flavour than any
cold-storage meat that can be brought into the country; and, save at one
or two centres of population and distribution, cold-storage meat is not
available at all. Without its big game Alaska would be virtually
uninhabitable. Therefore most white men are content that the necessary
measures be taken to prevent the wasteful slaughter of the game; for the
rights of the prospector and trapper and traveller, and the rights of
the natives to kill at any time what is necessary for food, are
explicitly reserved.

[Sidenote: THE KETCHUMSTOCK]

We reached the village and telegraph post of Ketchumstock for the night
only to find all the natives gone hunting; but since they had gone in
the direction of Chicken Creek, towards which we were travelling, we
were able to catch up with them the next morning without going far out
of our way. While we were pitching our tent near their encampment came
two or three natives with dog teams, and as the dogs hesitated to pass
our dogs, loose on the trail, a voluble string of curses in English fell
from the Indian lips. Such is usually the first indication of contact
with white men, and in this case it spoke of the proximity of the mining
on Chicken Creek. To discover the women chewing tobacco was to add but
another evidence of the sophistication of this tribe; a different people
from Chief Isaac's tribe, different through many years' familiarity with
the whites at these diggings. If the mission to be built at the Crossing
tends to keep these Indians on the Tanana River and thus away from the
demoralisation of the diggings, it will do them solid service.

In some way foul and profane language falls even more offensively from
Indians than from whites; for the same reason, perhaps, that it sounds
more offensive and shocking from children than from adults. Sometimes
the Indian does not in the least understand the meaning of the words he
uses; they are the first English words he ever heard and he hears them
over and over again.

So here another day and a half was spent in instruction. There are some
forty souls in this tribe and they have had teaching from time to time,
though not in the last few years, at the mouths of missionaries from
Yukon posts. Most of the adults had been baptized; I baptized sixteen
children. One curious feature of my stay was the megaphonic
recapitulation of the heads of the instruction, after each session, by
an elderly Indian who stood out in the midst of the tents. What on earth
this man, with his town-crier voice, was proclaiming at such length, we
were at a loss to conjecture, and upon inquiry were informed: "Them
women, not much sense; one time tell 'em, quick forget; two time tell
'em, maybe little remember." So when we stopped for dinner and for
supper and for bed, each time this brazen-lunged spieler stood forth and
reiterated the main points of the discourse "for the _hareem_," as
Doughty would say, whose account of the attitude of the Arabs to their
women often reminds me of the Alaskan Indians. It was interesting, but I
should have preferred to edit the recapitulation.

When all was done for the day and we thought to go to bed came an Indian
named "Bum-Eyed-Bob" (these white man's nicknames, however dreadful, are
always accepted and used) for a long confabulation about the affairs of
the tribe, and I gathered incidentally that gambling at the telegraph
station had been the main diversion of the winter. It seems ungracious
to insist so much upon the evil influence of the white men--we had been
cordially received and entertained at that very place, and our money
refused--but there is little doubt that the abandonment of the
telegraph-line will be a good thing for these natives. Put two or three
young men of no special intellectual resource or ambition down in a
lonely spot like this, with no society at all save that of the natives
and practically nothing to do, and there is a natural and almost
inevitable trend to evil. To the exceptional man with the desire of
promotion, with books, and all this leisure, it would be an admirable
opportunity, but he would be quite an exceptional man who should rise
altogether superior to the temptations to idleness and debauchery. One
may have true and deep sympathy with these young men and yet be
conscious of the harm they often bring about.

Ten miles or so from the encampment brought us to Chicken Creek, and
from that point we took the Fortymile River. The direct trail to Eagle
with its exasperating mule tracks was now left, and our journey was on
the ice. But so warm was the weather that 16th of March that we were
wet-foot all day, and within the space of eight hours that we were
travelling we had snow, sleet, rain, and sunshine. Leaving the main
river, we turned up Walker Fork and, after a few miles, leaving that, we
turned up Jack Wade Creek and pursued it far up towards its head ere we
reached the road-house for the night.

[Sidenote: THE FORTYMILE]

We were now on historic ground, so far as gold mining in Alaska is
concerned. The "Fortymilers" bear the same pioneer relation to gold
mining in the North that the "Fortyniners" bear to gold mining in
California. Ever since 1886 placers have been worked in this district,
and it still yields gold, though the output and the number of men are
alike much reduced. It is interesting to talk with some of the original
locators of this camp, who may yet be found here and there in the
country, and to learn of the conditions in those early days when a
steamboat came up the Yukon once in a season bringing such supplies and
mail as the men received for the year. It was here that the problem of
working frozen ground was first confronted and solved; here that the
first "miner's law" was promulgated, the first "miners' meeting" dealt
out justice. Your "old-timer" anywhere is commonly _laudator temporis
acti_, but there is good reason to believe that these early, and
certainly most adventurous, gold-miners, some of whom forced a way into
the country when there were no routes of travel, and subsisted on its
resources while they explored and prospected it, were men of a higher
stamp than many who have come in since. The extent to which that early
prospecting was carried is not generally known, for these men, after the
manner of their kind, left no record behind them. There are few creek
beds that give any promise at all in the whole of this vast country that
have not had some holes sunk in them. Even in districts so remote as the
Koyukuk, signs of old prospecting are encountered. When a stampede took
place to the Red Mountain or Indian River country of the middle Koyukuk
in 1911-12, I was told that there was not a creek in the camp that did
not show signs of having been prospected long before, although it had
passed altogether out of knowledge that this particular region had ever
been visited by prospectors.

[Sidenote: "SNIPING ON THE BARS"]

As the Fortymile is the oldest gold camp in the North, some of its trail
making is of the best in Alaska. In particular the trail from the head
of Jack Wade Creek down into Steel Creek reminded one of the Alpine
roads in its bold, not to say daring, engineering. It drops from bench
to bench in great sweeping curves always with a practicable grade, and
must descend nigh a thousand feet in a couple of miles. At the mouth of
Steel Creek we are on the Fortymile River again, having saved a day's
journey by this traverse. And here, on the Fortymile, we passed several
men "sniping on the bars," as the very first Alaskan gold-miners did on
this same river, and probably on these same bars, twenty-five years ago.
One hand moved the "rocker" to and fro and the other poured water into
it with the "long Tom"; so was the gold washed out of the gravel taken
from just below the ice. It was interesting to see this primitive method
still in practice and to learn from the men that they were making
"better than wages."

The Fortymile is a very picturesque but most tortuous river. In one
place, called appropriately "The Kink," I was able to clamber over a
ridge of rocks and reach another bend of the river in six or seven
minutes, and then had to wait twenty-five minutes for the dog team,
going at a good clip, to come around to me. At length we reached the
spot where a vista cut through the timber that clothes both banks,
marked the 141st meridian, the international boundary, and passed out of
Alaska into British territory. A few miles more brought us to Moose
Creek, where a little Canadian custom-house is situated, and there we
spent the night.

The next day we reached the Yukon; passing gold dredges laid up for the
winter and other signs of still-persisting mining activity, going
through the narrow wild cañon of the Fortymile, and so to the little
town at its mouth of the same name, where there is a mission of the
Church of England and a post of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police. I
never come into contact with this admirable body of men without wishing
that we had a similar body charged with the enforcement of the law in
Alaska.

Sunday was spent there officiating for the layman in charge of the
mission and in interesting talk with the sergeant of police about the
annual winter journey from Dawson to Fort McPherson on the McKenzie,
from which he had just returned with a detail of men. The next winter he
and his detail lost their way and starved and froze to death on the same
journey.

Here at one time was a flourishing Indian mission and school, and here
Bishop Bompas, the true "Apostle of the North," lived for some time. The
story of this man's forty-five years' single-eyed devotion to the
Indians of the Yukon and McKenzie Rivers is one of the brave chapters of
missionary history. But the Church of England "does not advertise."
Writers about Alaska, even writers about Alaskan missions, carefully
collect all the data of the early Russian missions on the coast, but
ignore altogether the equally influential and lasting work done along
five hundred miles of what is now the American Yukon by the missionary
clergy of the English Church before and after the Purchase. Bishop
Bompas identified himself so closely with the natives as to become
almost one of them in the eyes of the white men, and many curious
stories linger amongst the old-timers as to his habits and appearance.
It is interesting to know that the bishop was a son of that Sergeant
Bompas of the English bar from whom Dickens drew the character of
Sergeant Buzfuz, counsel for the plaintiff in the famous suit of
"Bardell v. Pickwick."

But the natives have all left Fortymile, some to the large village of
Moosehide just below Dawson, some to Eagle. The town, too, like all the
upper Yukon towns, is much decayed; the custom-house, the police
barracks, the company's store, the road-house, and the little mission
embracing nearly all its activities and housing nearly all its
population.

There is always some feeling of satisfaction in reaching the broad
highway of the Yukon again, even though rough ice make bad going and one
of the most notorious, dirty road-houses in the North hold its menace
over one all day and amply fulfil it at night. There is indeed so little
travel on the river now that it does not pay any one to keep a
road-house save as incidental to a steamboat wood camp and summer
fishing station. Two short days' travel brought us across the
international boundary again to Eagle in Alaska, where at that time Fort
Egbert was garrisoned with two companies of soldiers.

[Sidenote: EAGLE]

Eagle and Fort Egbert together, for the one begins where the other ends,
have perhaps the finest and most commanding situation of any settlement
on the Yukon River. The mountains rise with dignity just across the
water and break pleasingly into the valley of Eagle Creek, a few miles
up-stream. To the rear of the town an inconsiderable flat does but give
space and setting before the mountains rise again; while just below the
military post stands the bold and lofty bluff called the Eagle Rock,
with Mission Creek winding into the Yukon at its foot. Robert Louis
Stevenson said that Edinburgh has the finest situation of any capital
in Europe and pays for it by having the worst climate of any city in the
world. It would not be just to paraphrase this description with regard
to Eagle, for while it is unsurpassed on the Yukon for site, there are
spots on that river where still more disagreeable weather prevails; yet
it cannot be denied that the position of the place subjects it to
exceedingly bitter winds, or that the valley of Eagle Creek, which gives
pleasing variety to the prospect, acts also as a channel to convey the
full force of the blast. Climate everywhere is a very local thing;
topographical considerations often altogether outweigh geographical; and
nowhere is this truer than in Alaska. Commanding sites are necessarily
exposed sites, and he who would dwell in comfort must build in
seclusion.

A native village of eighty or ninety souls, with its church and school,
lies three miles up-stream from the town, so that the relative positions
of village, town, and military post exactly duplicate those at Tanana.
It must at once be stated, however, that this situation has not led to
anything like the demoralisation amongst the natives at Eagle that
thrusts itself into notice at the other place. Whether it were the
longer training in Christian morals that lay behind these people, or
better hap in the matter of post commanders (certainly there was never
such scandalous irregularity and indifference at Egbert as marked one
administration at Gibbon), or the vigilance during a number of
consecutive years of an especially active deputy marshal and the wisdom
and concern through an even longer period of a commissioner much above
the common stamp,[F] or all these causes combined, the natives at Eagle
have not suffered from the proximity of soldiers and civilians in the
same measure as the natives at Tanana. Drunkenness and debauchery there
have been again and again, but they have been severely checked and
restrained by both the civil and military authorities.

It was pleasant during Holy Week and Easter to see so many of the
enlisted men of the garrison taking part in the services in town;
pleasant, especially, to see officers and men singing together in the
choir, a tribute to the tact and zeal of the earnest layman in charge of
this mission; and it was pleasant at the village to hear the native
liturgy again and to see old men and women following the lessons in the
native Bible.

[Sidenote: FORT EGBERT ABANDONED]

Fort Egbert is abandoned now, another addition to the melancholy of the
Yukon; its extensive buildings, barracks, and officers' quarters,
post-exchange and commissariat, hospital, sawmill, and artisans' shops,
a spacious, complete gymnasium only recently built, are all vacant and
deserted. In the yards lie three thousand cords of dry wood, a year's
supply; cut on the hills, awaiting the expected annual contracts, lie as
many more--six thousand cords of wood left to rot! Some of us perverse
"conservationists," upon whom the unanimous Alaskan press delights to
pour scorn, lament the trees more than the troops.

One may write thus and yet have many pleasant personal associations
with the post and those who have lived there. A large and varied
military acquaintanceship is acquired by regular visits to these Alaskan
forts, for the whole command changes every two years. If one stayed in
the country long enough one would get to know the whole United States
army, as regiment after regiment spent its brief term of "foreign
service" in the North. Gazing upon the empty quarters, the occasion of
my first visit came back vividly, when there was diphtheria amongst the
natives at Circle and none to cope with it save the missionary nurse.
The civil codes containing no provision for quarantine, the United
States commissioner at Circle could not help, and the Indians grew
restive and rebellious, and when Christmas came broke through the
restrictions completely. Even some of the whites of the place defied her
prohibition and attended native dances and encouraged the Indians in
their self-willed folly.

[Sidenote: SOME ARMY OFFICERS]

So I went up the week's journey to Eagle and sought assistance from
Major Plummer, the officer commanding the post, who, after telegraphing
to Washington, promptly despatched a hospital steward and a couple of
soldiers, and placed them entirely at the nurse's disposal. "I don't
think we have any law for it," he said, "but we'll bluff it out." And
bluff it out they did very effectively until the disease was stamped
out, and then they thoroughly disinfected and whitewashed every cabin
that had been occupied by the sick. I used to tell that nurse that, so
far as I knew, she was the only woman who had ever had command of United
States soldiers.

Then there was Captain Langdon of the same regiment, the scholarly
soldier, with the account of every great campaign in history at his
fingers' ends. I recollect one evening, when we had been talking of the
Peninsular War, I ventured to spring on him the ancient schoolboy
conundrum: "What lines are those, the most famous ever made by an
Englishman, yet that are never quoted?" "Lines?" said he, "lines?"
though I don't think he had ever heard the jest. "They must be the Lines
of Torres Vedras." How well I remember the musical box that used to
arouse me at seven in the morning, however late we had sat talking the
night before!

And that young lieutenant, of wealthy New York people, just arrived from
West Point, who was sent by another commandant to report upon the
condition of the natives at the village and who came back and reported
the whole population in utter destitution and recommended the issue of
free rations to them all! As a matter of fact, during the administration
of this commanding officer, some sixteen or eighteen persons were put
upon the list for gratuitous grub, and it took a written protest to get
them off. For no one who has the welfare of the natives at heart can
tolerate the notion of making them paupers; these who have always fended
abundantly for themselves, and can entirely do so yet. With free rations
there would be no more hunting, no more trapping, no more fishing; and a
hardy, self-supporting race would sink at once to sloth and beggary and
forget all that made men of them. If it were designed to destroy the
Indian at a blow, here is an easy way to do it. Yet there are some,
obsessed with the craze about what is called education, regarding it as
an end in itself and not as a means to any end, who recommend this
pauperising because it would permit the execution of a compulsory
school-attendance law. Or is it a personal delusion of mine that esteems
an honest, industrious, self-supporting Indian who cannot read and write
English above one who can read and write English--and can do nothing
else--and so separates me from many who are working amongst the natives?

These days at the end of March, when the sun shines more than twelve
hours in the twenty-four, are too long for the ordinary winter day's
twenty-five miles or so, and yet not quite long enough, even if man and
dogs could stand it, to double the stage; so that there is much daylight
leisure at road-houses. One grows anxious, after four months on the
trail, to be done with it; to draw as quickly as may be to one's
"thawing-out" place. One even becomes a little impatient of the
continual dog talk and mining talk of the road-houses, to which one has
listened all the winter. On the other hand, the travelling is very
pleasant and the going usually very good, so that one may often ride on
the sled for long stretches.

By river and portage--one portage that comes so finely down to the Yukon
from a bench that there is pleasure in anticipating the view it
affords--in two days we reached the Nation road-house, just below the
mouth of the Nation River, a name that has always puzzled me. Here all
night long the wolves howling around the carcass of a horse kept our
dogs awake, and the whimpering of the dogs kept us awake. The country
beyond the Yukon to the northeast, the large area included between the
Yukon and the Porcupine, into which the Nation River offers passage, is
one of the wildest and least known portions of Alaska, abounding in game
and beasts of prey.

[Sidenote: THE GLARE OF THE SUN]

At the Charley River we visited the native village and held service and
instruction as well as inadequate interpretation permitted. Round Coal
Creek and Woodchopper Creek the scenery becomes bold and attractive, but
we found, as usual, that as we pushed farther and farther down the river
the snow was deeper and the going not so good. The sun grows very bright
upon the snow these days of late March and early April. Even through
heavily tinted glasses it inflames the eyes more or less, and a couple
of hours without protection would bring snow-blindness. Bright days at
this season are the only days in all the year when the camera shutter
may be used at its full speed. When the sun comes out after a flurry of
new snow in April, the light is many times greater than in midsummer.

[Illustration: "A PORTAGE THAT COMES SO FINELY DOWN TO THE YUKON THAT
THERE IS PLEASURE IN ANTICIPATING THE VIEW IT AFFORDS."]

[Illustration: FORT YUKON.]

We reached Circle in a day and a half from Woodchopper Creek, in time to
spend Sunday there. Circle had not changed much in the five years that
had elapsed since the first visit to it mentioned in these pages. The
slender trellis of the wireless telegraph had added a prominent feature
to its river bank; a few more empty cabins had been torn down for
fire-wood. Here it was necessary to shoot the Great Dane pup we got at
the Salchaket. His feet were still very sore and he quite useless for
the next winter, while Doc was returned to me from Fairbanks, not
much the worse for his severe frost-bite. Indian after Indian begged for
the dog, but I had more regard for him than to turn him over to the
tender mercies of an Indian. There are exceptional Indians, but for my
part I would rather be a dead dog than an ordinary Indian's dog--so he
died.

There remained the seventy-five or eighty miles through the Yukon Flats
to Fort Yukon--always the most dangerous stretch of the river, and at
this season, when the winter's trail was beginning to break up,
particularly so. It would be entirely practicable to cut a land trail
that should not touch the river at all, or not at more than one point,
between Circle and Fort Yukon, and such a portage besides removing all
the danger would save perhaps twenty miles. In many places it was
necessary for one of us to go ahead with an axe, constantly sounding and
testing the ice. Here and there we made a circuit around open water into
which the ice that bore the trail had collapsed bodily--one of them a
particularly ugly place, with black water twenty feet deep running at
six or seven miles an hour. I never pass this stretch of river without a
feeling of gratitude that I am safely over it once more.

[Sidenote: CAPTAIN AMUNDSEN]

As we left the Halfway Island we passed an Indian from Fort Yukon going
up the river with dogs and toboggan, and I chuckled, as I returned his
very polite salutation and shook hands with him, at the success of the
way he had been dealt with the previous fall, for he had been a
particularly churlish fellow with an insolent manner. Six or seven
years before he had been taken by Captain Amundsen, of the _Gjoa_, as
guide along this stretch of the river. It will be remembered that when
that skilful and fortunate navigator had reached Herschell Island from
the east, he left his ship in winter quarters and made a rapid journey
with Esquimaux across country to Fort Yukon expecting to find a
telegraph station there from which he could send word of his success.
But to his disappointment he found it necessary to go two hundred and
thirty miles farther up the river to Eagle, before he could despatch his
message. So he left his Esquimaux at Fort Yukon and took this Indian as
guide. And in his modest and most interesting book he mentions the man's
surliness and says he was glad to get rid of him at Circle.

Some new outbreak of insolence for which he had been flung out of a
store decided that he must be dealt with, and I sent for him, for the
chief, the native minister, and the interpreter. With these assessors
beside me, and Captain Amundsen's book open on the table, I spoke to the
man of his general conduct and reputation. I read the derogatory remark
about him in the book "printed for all the world to read," and told him
that of all the people, white and native, the captain had met on his
journeys, only one was spoken of harshly and he was the one. It made a
great impression on the man. The chief and the native minister followed
it up with their harangues, and the net result was a thorough change in
his whole attitude and demeanour. He told us he felt the shame of being
held up to the world as rude and impudent and would try to amend. He has
tried so successfully that he is now one of the politest and most
courteous Indians in the village, for which, if this should ever chance
to reach Captain Amundsen's eye, I trust he will accept our thanks.

Fort Yukon, where the headquarters of the archdeaconry of the Yukon are
now fixed, grows in native population and importance. A new and sightly
church, a new schoolhouse, a new two-story mission house, a medical
missionary and a nurse in residence, as well as a native clergyman, mark
the Indian metropolis of this region and perhaps of all interior Alaska.
Self-government is fostered amongst the people by a village council
elected annually, that settles native troubles and disputes and takes
charge of movements for the general good, and of the relief of native
poverty. The resident physician has been appointed justice of the peace
and there is effort to enforce the law of the land at a place where
every man has been a law unto himself. But it is a very slow and
difficult matter to enforce law in this country at all, and more
particularly at these remote points; and the class of white men who are
to be found around native villages, many of whom "fear not God neither
regard man," pursue their debauchery and deviltry long time unwhipped.

FOOTNOTE:

[F] I take pleasure in naming Mr. U. G. Myers as the United States
commissioner in question and Mr. Jack Robinson as the deputy United
States marshal, and I mention their names the more readily because Mr.
Myers, after his long and excellent service, has just been removed for
political reasons. (May, 1916.)




CHAPTER X

FROM THE TANANA RIVER TO THE KUSKOKWIM--THENCE TO THE IDITAROD MINING
CAMP--THENCE TO THE YUKON, AND UP THAT RIVER TO FORT YUKON


THE discovery of gold on the Innoko in the winter of 1906-7, and the
"strike" on the Iditarod, a tributary of the Innoko, some three years
later, opened up a new region of Alaska. It is characteristic of a gold
discovery in a new district that it sets men feverishly to work
prospecting all the adjacent country, and sends them as far afield from
it as the new base of supplies will allow them to stretch their tether.
A glance at the map will show that the Innoko and Iditarod country lies
between the two great rivers of Alaska, the Yukon and the Kuskokwim,
much lower down the Yukon than any of the earlier gold discoveries; that
is to say that while the Tanana gold fields lie off the Middle Yukon,
the Circle fields off the upper Yukon, the Iditarod camp belongs to the
lower river. The Innoko workings were not extensive nor very rich, but
they furnished a base for prospecting from which the Iditarod was
reached, and Flat Creek, in the latter district, promised to be
wonderfully rich. Immediately upon the news of this strike reaching the
other camps of the interior, preparations were made far and wide for
migrating thither upon the opening of Yukon navigation, and the early
summer of 1910 saw a wild stampede to the Iditarod. Saloon-keepers,
store-keepers, traders of all kinds, and the rag-tag and bobtail that
always flock to a new camp were on the move so soon as the ice went out.
From Dawson, from the Fortymile, from Circle, from Fairbanks, from the
Koyukuk, and as soon as Bering Sea permitted, from Nome, all sorts of
craft bore all sorts of people to the new Eldorado, while the first
through steamboats from the outside were crowded with people from the
Pacific coast eager to share in the opportunity of wealth. The
sensational magazines had been printing article after article about "The
incalculable riches of Alaska," and here were people hoping to pick some
of it up. Iditarod City sprang into life as the largest "city" of the
interior; the centre of gravity of the population of the interior of
Alaska was shifted a thousand miles in a month.

Iditarod City furnished a new and large base of supplies. Amidst the
heterogeneous mass of humanity that swarmed into the place, though by no
means the largest element in it, were experienced prospectors from every
other district in Alaska. Under the iniquitous law that then prevailed
and has only recently been modified, by which there was no limit at all
to the number of claims in a district which one man could stake for
himself and others, every creek adjacent to Flat Creek, every creek for
many miles in every direction, had long since been tied up by the men
with lead-pencils and hatchets. So the newly arrived prospectors must
spread out yet wider, and they were soon scattered over all the rugged
hundred miles between Iditarod City and the Kuskokwim River. Here and
there they found prospects; and here and there what promised to be
"pay." They started a new town, Georgetown, on the Kuskokwim itself;
another town sprang up on the Takotna, a tributary of the Kuskokwim; and
the great Commercial Company of Alaska, ever alert for new developments,
put a steamboat on the Kuskokwim and built trading-posts at both these
points. Thus the Kuskokwim country, which for long had been one of the
least-known portions of Alaska, was opened up almost at a stroke.

[Sidenote: CAMP AT 50° BELOW]

It was my purpose to visit Iditarod City during the winter of 1910-11,
although, by reason of the distance to be travelled, a journey thither
would involve the omission of the customary winter visit to upper Yukon
points. When the northern trip to the Koyukuk was returned from at
Tanana, a sad journey had to be made to Nenana to bury the body of Miss
Farthing, and Doctor Loomis, missionary physician at Tanana, who
accompanied me on this errand, had almost as rough a breaking-in to the
Alaska trail as we came back to Tanana again as Doctor Burke had in our
journey over the "first ice" of the Koyukuk two years before. Two feet
of new snow lay on the trail, and the thermometer went down to 60° below
zero. We were camped once on the mail trail, unable to reach a
road-house, at 50° below zero.

[Illustration: THE ROUGH BREAKING IN OF DOCTOR LOOMIS, CAMPED ON THE
MAIL TRAIL AT 50° BELOW ZERO, UNABLE TO REACH A ROAD-HOUSE FOR THE DEEP
SNOW.]

[Illustration: ESQUIMAUX OF THE UPPER KUSKOKWIM.]

[Sidenote: THE ROUTE TO THE IDITAROD]

From Tanana the beaten track to the Iditarod lay one hundred and sixty
miles down the Yukon to Lewis's Landing, and then across country by the
Lewis Cut-Off one hundred miles to Dishkaket on the Innoko, and
thence across country another hundred miles to Iditarod City. But I
designed to penetrate to the Iditarod by another route. I had long
desired to visit Lake Minchúmina and its little band of Indians, and to
pass through the upper Kuskokwim country. So I had engaged a Minchúmina
Indian as a guide, and laid my course up the Tanana River to the
Coschaket, and then due south across country to Lake Minchúmina and the
upper Kuskokwim.

The Cosna is a small stream confluent with the Tanana, about thirty
miles above the mouth of that river, and we had hoped to reach it by the
river trail upon the same day we left the mission at Tanana, the 18th of
February, 1911. But the trail was too heavy and the going too slow and
the start too late. When we had reached Fish Creek, about half-way, it
was already growing dark, and we were glad to stop in a native cabin,
where was an old widow woman with a blind daughter. The daughter,
unmarried, had a little baby, and I inquired through Walter who the
father was and whether the girl had willingly received the man or if he
had taken advantage of her blindness. She named an unmarried Indian,
known to me, and declared that she had not been consenting. It seemed a
paltry and contemptible trick to take advantage of a fatherless blind
girl. I baptized the baby and resolved to make the man marry the girl.

The next night we reached the Coschaket, which, following the Indian
rule, means "mouth of the Cosna," and found that our guide, Minchúmina
John, had already relayed a load of grub that Walter had previously
brought here from Tanana, one day's march upon our journey. Our course
from the Coschaket left the Tanana River and struck across country by an
old Indian trail that had not been used that winter. Through scrubby
spruce and over frozen lakes and swamps, crossing the Cosna several
times--a narrow little river with high steep banks--the trail went,
until it brought us to a hunting camp of the Indians, about eighteen
miles from the Coschaket. Here our stuff was cached and here we spent
the night, doctoring the sick amongst them as well as we could. My eyes
had been sorely tried this day despite dark smoked glasses, for we were
travelling almost due south, and the sun was now some hours in the sky
and yet low enough to shine right in one's face. So Walter stopped at a
birch-tree, stripped some of the bark, and made an eye-shade that was a
great comfort and relief.

From this place began the slow work of double-tripping. The unbroken
snow was too deep to permit the hauling of our increased load over it
without a preliminary breaking out of a trail on snow-shoes. So camp was
left standing and Walter and John went ahead all day and returned late
at night with eight or nine miles of trail broken, while I stayed in
camp and had dog feed cooked and supper ready. The next day we advanced
the camp so far as the trail was broken. A moose had used the trail for
some distance, however, since the boys left it, and his great plunging
hoofs had torn up the snow worse than a horse would have done.

A driving wind and heavy snowfall had drifted the new trail in the night
so badly, moreover, that we were not able to cover the full stretch
that had been snow-shoed, but camped in the dusk after we had gone eight
miles. Eight miles in two days was certainly very poor travel, and at
this rate our supplies would never take us down to the forks of the
Kuskokwim. Yet there was no other way in which we could proceed. The
weather was exceedingly mild, too mild for comfort--the thermometer
ranging from 20° to 25° above--and the dogs felt the unseasonable
warmth. It took us all that week to make the watershed between the
drainage of the Tanana and the drainage of the Kuskokwim, a point about
half-way to Lake Minchúmina. One day trail was broken, the next day the
loads went forward. Tie the dogs as securely as one would, it was not
safe to go off and leave our supplies exposed to the ravages that a
broken chain or a slipped collar might bring, so two went forward and I
sat down in camp. The boys on their return usually brought with them a
few brace of ptarmigan or grouse or spruce hen or, at the least, a
rabbit or so.

[Sidenote: THE CAMP-ROBBERS]

The camp-robbers, to my mind the most interesting of Alaskan birds,
became very friendly and tame on these vigils. They stay in the country
all the winter, when most birds have migrated, like prosperous mine
owners, to less rigorous climates; they turn up everywhere, in the most
mysterious way, so soon as one begins to make any preparation for
camping, and they are bold and fearless and take all sorts of chances.
On this journey more than once they alighted on a moving sled and pecked
at the dried fish that happened to be exposed. Yet they are so alert and
so quick in their movements that it would be difficult to catch them
were they actually under one's hand. One of them, during a long day in
camp, grew so tame that it pecked crumbs off the toe of my moccasin, and
in another day or two would, one feels sure, have eaten out of the hand.
There is a curious belief, strongly intrenched in the Alaskan mind, that
the nest of this most common bird has never been found, and that the
Smithsonian Institution has a standing offer of a large sum of money for
the discovery. They build in the spruce-trees, ten or twelve feet above
the ground, a nest of rough twigs, and lay five very small eggs, grey
spotted with black. This, at any rate, is the description that Walter
gives me of a nest he discovered with the bird sitting upon it, and I
have found the boy's accounts of such matters entirely trustworthy. It
is curious, however, that the nest of a bird so common all over Alaska
as the camp-robber should be so rarely found. At times they are very
mischievous and destructive, and the man who builds a careless cache
will often be heard denouncing them, but to my mind a bird who gives us
his enlivening company throughout the dead of an Alaskan winter deserves
what pickings he can get.

[Sidenote: SOFT WEATHER]

On Saturday, the 25th of February, after climbing a rather stiff hill,
we passed temporarily out of Yukon into Kuskokwim waters, for the
tributaries of these two great drainage systems interlock in these
hills. At the foot of the hill we stopped for lunch, a roaring fire was
soon built, and a great cube of beaten snow impaled upon a stake was set
up before the fire to drip into a pan for tea water, while the boys
roasted rabbits. In a few hours more we were on the banks of one of the
tributaries of the East Fork (properly the North Fork) of the Kuskokwim.
Here, in an unoccupied native cabin, we made our camp and lay over
Sunday, and here began the most remarkable spell of weather I have known
in the interior at this season of the year. The thermometer rose to 37°
and then to 40°; the snow everywhere was thawing, and presently it began
to rain steadily. It was the first time I had seen a decided thaw in
February, let alone rain.

Next day the rain turned to snow, but since the thermometer still stood
around 40°, the snow melted as it fell, and we were wet through all day.
The snow underfoot, however, was so much less and so much harder that we
were able to proceed without preliminary trail breaking. But it was a
most disagreeable day and the prelude to a more disagreeable night.
Soft, wet snow clings to everything it touches. The dogs are soon
carrying an additional burden; balls of snow form on all projecting
tufts of hair; masses of snow must continually be beaten off the sled.
Every time a snow-shoe is lifted from the ground it lifts a few pounds
of snow with it. One's moccasins and socks are soon wet through, and the
feet, encased in this sodden cold covering, grow numb and stay so. We
crossed a considerable mountain pass in driving snow, and should never
have found the way without John, for much of it was above timber, and
when it took us through woods the blazes on the trees were so bleached
with age as to be difficult of recognition. The Indians have used this
trail for generations; but few white men have ever passed along it.

Wet snow, wet spruce boughs, wet tent, wet wood, wet clothing make poor
camping. Water-proof equipment is so rarely needed on the winter trail
that one does not bother with it. But the climate of the Kuskokwim
valley is evidently different from that of the rest of the interior, if,
as John said, such weather is not remarkable in these parts at this
season. A third day was of much the same description; thawing and
heavily snowing all day, the thermometer between 36° and 40°. The labour
of going ahead of the teams and breaking trail, on the snow-shoes,
through slush, grew so great that I relinquished it to John and took the
handle-bars of his sled. We were approaching Lake Minchúmina, but the
hills that led us into Yukon waters once more and should have given us
views of the lake and the great mountains beyond gave nothing. It is a
keen disappointment to be utterly denied great views, the expectation of
which has been a support through long distances and fatigues.

At noon we built a fire with considerable difficulty, but once it was
started we plied it with fuel till we had a noble, roaring bonfire, and
we hung our wet socks and moccasins and parkees and caps and mitts
around it and stayed there until they were dry, though the resumption of
our journey in the continuous melting snow soon wet everything through
again.

[Sidenote: LAKE MINCHÚMINA]

At length, late in the evening of the 28th of February, we descended a
long ridge and came upon the northeastern shore of Lake Minchúmina, one
of the most considerable lakes of interior Alaska. It stretched its
broad expanse away into the misty distance, the farther shore quite
invisible, the snow driving slowly over it, and it looked as though we
had stumbled by mistake upon the shores of the Arctic Ocean. There was
no sort of trail upon it and the snow-shoes sank through the melting
snow of its surface into the water that lay upon the ice and brought up
a load of slush at every step; yet the going would have been still worse
without them. The recollection of the six miles we trudged across that
lake is a dismal recollection of utter fatigue, of mechanical lifting
and falling of encumbered feet with the recurring feeling that it would
be impossible to lift them any more. All across that lake I ate snow,
and that and the back-ache legacy of an old strain are my signs of
approaching exhaustion. Four hours passed ere we heard the noise of dogs
and saw the glimmer of a light through the darkness, and the hearts of
men and beasts alike leaped to the expectation of rest and shelter. We
had feared the village might be deserted and were rejoiced that the
Indians were still there.

Never was hospitality more grateful than that we had from the little
remote band of natives at the Minchúmina village. They made a pot of tea
and fried some flap-jacks for us, and that was our supper, though I
think the boys ate some boiled moose meat from a pot on the stove. We
had plenty of grub, but were too weary to cook it; we spread our bedding
down on the floor amongst a dozen others and fell almost at once into a
deep sleep. Almost at once; for the arrival of our eight dogs had made a
commotion amongst the canine population of the place, that after
repeated outbreaks of noisy animosity and defiance seemed to turn by
common consent into a friendly and most protracted howling contest in
which my malamute "Muk" plainly outdid all competitors. How much longer
the noise would have kept up it is hard to say--dogs never seem too
tired to howl--but when the limit of Indian patience was reached, an
aged crone rolled out of the bed into which she had rolled "all
standing," seized a staff and went outdoors to lay it impartially upon
the backs of all the disturbers of the peace, domestic and foreign, with
a screech that was as formidable as the blows. The rest was silence.

The next morning a dozen alarm-clocks went off within a few minutes of
each other. Every adult in that cabin owned a separate alarm-clock, and
rose, one supposes, to the summons of no other timepiece. At any rate,
the clocks went off at intervals, and the natives arose one by one and
seemed hugely to enjoy the clatter. Let one purchase a new thing and
every individual in the community must have one also.

But what struck me instantly upon arising was the miraculous
transformation that had taken place outdoors. The sun was shining
brilliantly through a clear sky! I hastened to dress and, not waiting
for breakfast, seized my camera and started out. The chinook was over;
the sharp, welcome tang of frost was in the air; the snow was hard
underfoot. Out upon the gleaming surface of the lake I went for nigh a
mile, resolutely refusing to look behind. I knew what vision awaited me
when I turned around, had, indeed, caught a slight glimpse as I left the
cabin, and I wanted the smooth, open foreground of the lake that I
might see it to the best advantage.

[Sidenote: DENALI AND HIS WIFE]

There is probably no other view of North America's greatest mountain
group comparable to that from Lake Minchúmina. From almost every other
coign of vantage in the interior I had seen it and found it more or less
unsatisfying. Only from distant points like the Pedro Dome or the summit
between Rampart and Glen Gulch does the whole mass and uplift of it come
into view with dignity and impressiveness. At close range the peaks seem
stunted and inconspicuous, their rounded, retreating slopes lacking
strong lines and decided character. But from the lake the precipitous
western face of Denali and Denali's Wife rise sheer, revealed by the
level foreground of the snow from base to summit. It was, indeed, a
glorious scene. There stood the master peak, seeming a stupendous
vertical wall of rock rising twenty thousand feet to a splendid sharp
crest perhaps some forty or fifty miles away; there, a little farther to
the south, rose the companion mass, a smaller but still enormous
elevation of equally savage inaccessibility; while between them, near
the base, little sharp peaks stretched like a corridor of ruined arches
from mass to mass. One was struck at once by the simple appropriateness
of the native names for these mountains. The master peak is Denali--the
great one; the lesser peak is Denali's Wife; and the little peaks
between are the children. And my indignation kindled at the substitution
of modern names for these ancient mountain names bestowed immemorially
by the original inhabitants of the land! Is it too late to strike Mount
McKinley and Mount Foraker from the map? The names were given fifteen or
sixteen years ago only, by one who saw them no nearer than a hundred
miles. Is it too late to restore the native names contemptuously
displaced?

The majesty of the scene grew upon me as I gazed, and presently hand
went to camera that some record of it might be attempted. But alas for
the limitations of photography! I knew, even as I made the exposures,
first at one one-hundredth of a second and then at one-fiftieth, that
there was little hope of securing a picture; the air was yet faintly
hazy with thin vapour; the early sun made too acute an angle with the
peaks; and the yellow lens screen was left in the hind-sack of the sled.
It was even as I feared. When developed some months later, the film held
absolutely no trace of the mighty mountains that had risen so proudly
before it. I promised myself that at noon, when the sun had removed to a
greater distance from the mountains and made a more favourable angle
with them, I would return and try again; but by noon had come another
sudden, violent change of the weather, and snow was falling once more.

[Sidenote: THE MINCHÚMINA FOLK]

So I got no picture, save the picture indelibly impressed upon my
memory, of the noblest mountain scene I had ever gazed upon which made
memorable this 1st of March; perhaps one of the noblest mountain scenes
in the whole world, for one does not recall another so great uplift from
so low a base. The marshy, flat country that stretches from Minchúmina
to the mountains cannot be much more than one thousand feet above the
sea. Those awful precipices dropping thousands of feet at a leap, those
peaks rising serene and everlasting into the highest heaven, the
overwhelming size and strength and solidity of their rocky bulk, all
this sank into my heart, and there sprang up once again the passionate
desire of exploring the bowels of them, of creeping along their glaciers
and up their icy ridges, of penetrating their hidden chambers, inviolate
since the foundation of the world, and maybe scaling their ultimate
summits and looking down upon all the earth even as they look down!

Men, however, and not mountains, made the immediate demand upon one's
interest and attention, and I returned to breakfast and the duties of
the day. The Minchúmina people are a very feeble folk, some sixteen all
told at the time of our visit, greatly reduced by the epidemics of the
last decade, living remote from all others on the verge of their race's
habitat. They trade chiefly at Tanana, a hundred and thirty miles or so
away, walking an annual trip thither with their furs, and owning a
nominal allegiance to our mission at that place. It was the first time
that any clergyman had ever visited them, and the whole of the day was
spent with them, discovering what they knew and trying to teach them a
little more. The people sat around on the floor and hung upon the lips
of the interpreter. But what a barrier a difference of language is! An
interpreter is like a mountain pass, a means of access but at the cost
of time and labour. He does not remove the obstruction. The Minchúmina
people occupy a fine country that could amply support ten times the
Indian population that now inhabits it. We were, indeed, now entering a
country that has been almost depopulated by successive epidemics of
contagious diseases. The measles in 1900 slew most of them, and
diphtheria in 1906 destroyed all the children and many of the adults
that remained. The chief of this little band wore a hat proudly adorned
with ribbons and plumes, and flew a flag before his dwelling with the
initials of the North American Trading and Transportation Company on
it--a defunct Alaskan corporation. We could not learn the origin
thereof; the flag and the letters were plainly home-made. It was
probably a mere imitation of a flag he had seen years ago at Tanana,
copied without knowledge of the meaning of the letters, as the Esquimaux
often copy into the decoration of their clothing and equipment the
legends from canned foods.

Lake Minchúmina drains by a fork of the Kantishna River into the Tanana
and so into the Yukon. Just beyond the southwestern edge of the lake
runs a deep gully for perhaps a mile that leads to another lake called
Tsórmina, which drains into Minchúmina. And just beyond Tsórmina is a
little height of land, on the other side of which lies Lake Sishwóymina,
which drains into the Kuskokwim. So that little height of land is
another watershed between Alaska's two great rivers. Lakes Tsórmina and
Sishwóymina are not on any maps; indeed, this region has never been
mapped save very crudely from the distant flanks of Denali upon one of
Alfred Brook's early bold journeys into the interior of Alaska on
behalf of the Geological Survey. Although the Russians had
establishments on the lower Kuskokwim seventy-five years ago, and the
river is the second largest in Alaska and easy of navigation, yet the
white man had penetrated very little into this country until the Innoko
and Iditarod "strikes" of 1908 and 1909 respectively.

It was our plan to follow the main valley of the Kuskokwim until the
confluence of the Takotna with that stream, just below the junction of
the main North and South Forks of the Kuskokwim, and then strike
northwestward across country to the Iditarod.

The snow had passed and the sun was bright and the thermometer around
zero all day when we left Minchúmina to pursue our journey. The welcome
change in the weather had brought a still more welcome change in travel.
The decided and continued thaw followed by sharp cold had put a crust on
the snow that would hold up the dogs and the sled and a man on small
trail snow-shoes anywhere. Trail making was no longer necessary, and in
two days we made upward of fifty miles. So much difference does surface
make.

[Sidenote: TALIDA]

Across the end of Lake Minchúmina, across Tsórmina and Sishwóymina and a
number of lesser lakes we went, following a faint show-shoe trail
towards a distant mountain group to the southwest, the Talida Mountains,
at the foot of which lay the Talida village. On the other hand, to the
east and southeast, we had tantalising glimpses through haze and cloud
of the two great mountains, and presently of the lesser peaks of the
whole Alaskan range, sweeping its proud curve to the coast. For a long
way on the second day we travelled on the flat top of a narrow ridge
that must surely have been a lateral moraine of a glacier, what time the
ice poured down from the heights and stretched far over this
valley--then through scattered timber, increasing in size and thickness
and already displaying character that differed somewhat from the
familiar forests of the Yukon. The show-shoe trail we were following was
made by a messenger despatched by the Minchúmina people to invite the
Talida people to a potlatch; for the caches were filled with moose meat
beyond local consumption. Early on the second day we met him returning
and learned that he had gone on to yet another village a day's journey
farther, still on our route.

The people were all gone hunting from the tiny native hamlet of Talida,
but we entered a cabin and made ourselves at home. We had passed into
the region where the Greek Church holds nominal sway, of which the icons
with little candles before them on the walls gave token. No priest ever
visits them, but a native at a village on the south fork where is a
church holds some position analogous to that of a lay reader. The
nearest priest is a half-breed, ill spoken of for irregularity of life,
some two hundred miles farther down the river. The Greek Church is
relaxing its hold in Alaska, perhaps inevitably, and suffers sadly since
the removal of the bishop from Sitka from lack of supervision. Also we
had passed out of Indian country into the land of the Esquimaux, for
these people, far up towards the head of the river as they were, had
yet come at some period from the mouth. We were out of Walter's language
range now, and were glad that the bilingual John of the march country
was with us to serve as interpreter.

Standing proudly up against the wall in one corner of the cabin was a
rather pathetic object to my eyes--an elaborate gilt-handled silk
umbrella. There needed no one to tell its story; it spoke of a visit to
the Yukon with furs to sell and the usual foolish purchase of gay and
glittering trash--novel and quite useless. What easy prey these poor
people are to the wiles of the trader! Said one of them to me recently,
when I asked the purpose of an "annex" to his store with a huge
billiard-table in it--at an exclusive native village--"It's to get their
money; there's no use trying to fool you; if we can't get it one way
we've got to get it another." This gorgeous silk umbrella was concrete
expression of the same sentiment. It was bought outside, it was brought
into the country, it was set on exhibition in the store, because some
trader judged it likely to attract a native eye. No one, white or
native, uses an umbrella in interior Alaska.

We made twenty-five miles the next day through a wide, open country,
well wooded in places with a park-like distribution of trees, unwonted
in our travels and attractive. A new species of spruce threw thick
branches right down to the ground and tapered up to a perfect cone; each
tree apart from the others and surrounded by sward instead of
underbrush. There was a dignity about these trees that the common Yukon
spruce never attains. Rolling hills of small elevation stretched on
either hand and game signs abounded. After eight hours of such travel
we spoke of camping, but presently saw footprints in the snow and pushed
on to the bank of a little river, the Chedolothna, where stood a cabin,
a tent, and several high caches. Here, with two families that occupied
the cabin, we stayed the night.

[Sidenote: MEASLES AND DIPHTHERIA]

Six people at this place, six at Talida, sixteen at Minchúmina, make up
all the population of a region perhaps a hundred and fifty miles square.
Yet it is a noble Indian country, one of the most favourable in all the
interior, capable of supporting hundreds of people. Signs, indeed, of a
much larger occupation of it were not wanting, and all accounts speak of
the wholesale destruction of the natives by disease. We were told of a
village a little farther up this stream where every living being, save
one old man, died of diphtheria five years previously, while those who
have heard the stories of the horrors of the epidemic of measles in
1900, usually connected in some way with the stampede to Nome of that
year when the disease seems to have entered the country, will understand
how a region once thickly peopled, for Alaska, has become the most
thinly peopled in all the territory.

A half-breed trader, long resident at a point perhaps two hundred miles
lower down the Kuskokwim, told me of coming back to a populous village
after an absence of a few weeks, to find every person dead and the
starving dogs tearing at the rotting corpses. It is terrible to think
what the irruption of a new disease may mean to these primitive natives.
Even a disease like measles, rarely fatal and not commonly regarded as
serious amongst whites, takes to itself a strange and awful virulence
when it invades this virgin blood. The people know no proper treatment;
maddened by the itching rash that covers the body, they fling off all
cover, rush outdoors naked, whatever the weather, and either roll in the
snow or plunge into the stream; with the result that the disease
"strikes in" and kills them. Such is the description that is given of
its course along the lower Yukon and Kuskokwim. At many a Yukon village
half the people died, despite the aid the few missionaries then on the
river could afford; upon the Kuskokwim the havoc seems to have been
still greater. Six years later, death again stalked through this region
after having visited the Yukon, and this time seized his victims by the
throat. In another chapter has been given some account of an outbreak of
diphtheria on the Chandalar, following a more serious epidemic at Circle
City and Fort Yukon. It was during that same winter the disease raged in
this region, remote from any sort of medical or even intelligent lay
aid, and swept off all the children that had been spared by the measles
or had been born since that time. At our next stopping-place we saw the
graves of nineteen children who died in one day!

[Sidenote: THE INDIAN GUIDE]

We learned that we were now within one day's travel of a road-house, at
or near the junction of the forks of the Kuskokwim, and that a
government trail had been surveyed and staked from the Iditarod to the
Sushitna, passing close to the same point, and that during the present
winter road-houses had sprung up along the western portion of it, so
that we should not have to make camp again on the way to Iditarod City.
All of which Minchúmina John had collected from the people in the
cabin, and now presented to me as reason why he should be released from
further service. I was loath to let him go until we were actually _at_
the road-house described, but he wanted to go back to the lake for the
potlatch then preparing, and said that two days' delay would bar him
from the best of the festivities.

So I settled with him, giving him fifty dollars of the sixty dollars
covenanted to the Iditarod, and grub enough to take him back to the
lake, and a rifle, for he was unprovided with firearms, and he went his
way back, richly content, to the gorging of unlimited moose meat that
awaited him, and the boy and I went ours. So far as merely his company
was concerned I was not sorry to lose him. The old saying holds good
upon the trail that "two is company and three is none." He interfered
with my boy's lessons. Since he had scarce any English, and could not be
ignored, the conversation was mainly in Indian. In a word he pulled the
company down to a native level. And I was anxious that Walter's
education should proceed.

This boy had been with me for two years, winter and summer, and it was a
great pleasure to witness his gracious development of body, mind, and
character. Clean-limbed, smooth-skinned, slender, and supple, his Indian
blood showing chiefly in a slight swarth of complexion and aquilinity of
feature, he now approached his twentieth year and began to gain the
strength of his manhood and to give promise of more than the average
stature and physical power. With only one full year's schooling behind
him, the year before he came to me, his active intelligence had made
such quick use of it that there was good foundation to build upon; and
our desultory lessons in camp--reading aloud, writing from dictation,
geography and history in such snippets as circumstances permitted--were
eagerly made the most of, and his mental horizon broadened continually.
Until his sixteenth year he had lived amongst the Indians almost
exclusively and had little English and could not read nor write. He was
adept in all wilderness arts. An axe, a rifle, a flaying knife, a skin
needle with its sinew thread--with all these he was at home; he could
construct a sled or a pair of snow-shoes, going to the woods for his
birch, drying it and steaming it and bending it; and could pitch camp
with all the native comforts and amenities as quickly as anybody I ever
saw. He spoke the naked truth, and was so gentle and unobtrusive in
manner that he was a welcome guest at the table of any mission we
visited. Miss Farthing at Nenana had laid her mark deep upon him in the
one year he was with her.

[Sidenote: THE HALF-BREED]

Before he came to me I had another half-breed for two years, and before
that there had been a series of full-blooded native boys. I found the
half-breed greatly preferable. With full command of the native language,
with such insight into the native mind as few white men ever attain, he
combines the white man's quickness of apprehension and desire for
knowledge; and the companionship had been pleasant and profitable. Both
these boys had picked up quickly and efficiently, without the slightest
previous experience, the running and the care of the four-cylinder
gasoline engine of the mission launch, and took a great and intelligent
interest in all machinery. As an interpreter the half-breed is far
superior to most full-bloods; he takes one's purport immediately; his
mind seems to leap with the speaker's mind, not only to follow
faithfully but to anticipate. And the further his English progresses, so
much the more excellent interpreter does he become.

My heart goes out to the large and rapidly increasing number of these
youths of mixed blood in Alaska. It is common to hear them spoken of
slightingly and contemptuously. There is what my mind always regards as
a damnable epigram current in the country to the effect that the
half-breed inherits the vices of both races and the virtues of neither.
The white man who utters this saying with a chuckle at his second-hand
wit has generally not much virtue to transmit, were virtue heritable.
But to thoughtful men nowadays this talk of the inheritance of virtues
and vices is mere folly. The half-breed in Alaska, as elsewhere, is the
product of his environment. Often without legitimate father--although in
an Indian community, where nothing is secret, his parentage is usually
well known--he is left for some native woman to support with the aid of
her native husband. He is reared with the full-blooded offspring of the
couple in the frankness that knows no reserve and the intimacy that
knows no restraint, of Indian life. The full extent of that frankness
and intimacy shocks even the loosest-living white man when he first
becomes aware of it. Where religion and decency have not been
faithfully inculcated there is no bound to it at all--it is complete.
Presently, as his superior intellectual inheritance begins to manifest
itself, as he grows up into consciousness that he is different from, and
in many ways superior to, the Indians around him, he is naturally drawn
to such white society as comes his way.

[Sidenote: THE LOW-DOWN WHITE]

In this book a good deal has been said, and, it may be thought by the
reader, said with a good deal of asperity, about the whites who frequent
Indian communities and come most into contact with the native people;
yet the more the author sees of this class, the less is he disposed to
modify any of the strictures he has put upon it. "The Low-Down White" is
the subject of one of the most powerful and scathing of Robert Service's
ballads, those most unequal productions with their mixture of strength
and feebleness, of true and forced notes, the best of which should
certainly live amongst the scant literature of the North. And, indeed,
the spectacle of the man of the higher race, with all the age-long
traditions and habits of civilisation behind him, descending below the
level of the savage, corrupting and debauching the savage and making
this corrupting and debauching the sole exercise of his more intelligent
and cultivated mind, is one that has aroused the disgust and indignation
of whites in all quarters of the world. Kipling and Conrad have drawn
him in the East; Robert Louis Stevenson in the South Sea Islands; any
army officer will draw him for you in the Philippines, which lack as yet
their great delineator; Service has not overdrawn him on the Yukon.

Now, it is to this man's society, for lack of other white society open
to him, that the young half-breed who feels his father's blood stirring
within him is drawn and is made welcome. He finds standards even lower,
because more sophisticated, than the standards of the Indians
themselves. He finds that honesty and morality are a sham, religion a
laughing-stock. He finds the chastity of women and the honour of men
sneeringly regarded as non-existent. He is taught to curse and swear, to
talk lewdly, to drink and gamble. He is taught that drunkenness and
sensuality are the only enjoyments worth looking forward to, and he soon
becomes as vile as his preceptors. The back room of the Indian trader's
store is often the scene of this tuition--barroom, assignation house,
gambling hell in one. But let that same youth be taken early in hand by
one who has a care for him and will be at some personal pains to train
him cleanly and uprightly, and he is as amenable to the good influences
as he would be to the bad if they were his sole environment. Conscious
all the time of his equivocal position, shy and timid about asserting
himself amongst whites, he is easy prey to the viciously as he is apt
pupil to the virtuously disposed.

What is said here of the male half-breeds applies _a fortiori_ to the
female. Unless early taken in hand by the missionary, or put under the
protection of some church boarding-school--and sometimes despite all
such care and teaching--the lot of the half-breed girl is a sad one; and
some of the lowest and vilest women of the land are of mixed blood.

The half-breed is assuredly to be reckoned with in the future of Alaska.
He is here to stay. He is here in increasing numbers. He is the natural
leader of the Indian population. There seems little doubt that when he
cares to assert his rights he is already an American citizen, although
judicial decisions are uncertain and conflicting in this matter.

The missions in the interior have recognised, though perhaps somewhat
tardily, the importance of the half-breeds, and have picked them up here
and there along the rivers and become responsible for their decent
rearing. Some, assuredly, of the future leaders of the native people are
now in training at the mission schools. Some, unfortunately, are in
quite as assiduous training by the unscrupulous Indian trader and his
coterie of low-down whites.

The skies had threatened snow since we arose, and when our diminished
expedition was well upon its way the snow began to fall. For thirty-six
hours it fell without cessation. Three days of good travel had put us
forward seventy-five or eighty miles; now once more we were "up against"
deep snow and trail breaking. An old native whom we met on his way to
the potlatch later in the day spread out his hands with a look of
despair and cried: "Good trail all lose'm!" All day we pushed on against
the driving storm, the flakes stinging our faces and striking painfully
against our eyeballs, now following a narrow steep woodland trail, now
awhile along a creek bed, now across open country with increasing
difficulty in finding our way, until it grew dark while yet we were
some miles from our destination, and we made camp; and all night long
the heavy snow continued.

So soon as we had struck our tent, crusted with ice, and had broken up
our wet camp next morning there was trouble about finding the trail.
Wide open spaces with never an indication of direction stretched before
us. Again and again we cast about, the boy to the left, I to the right,
to find some blaze or mark, but much of the course lay across open
country that bore none. And then I sorely regretted having let John go
back. Some miles before we came to a stop the previous evening, we
passed a native encampment with naught but women and children in it--the
men gone hunting. But we could not speak with them or get any
information from them, for our Kuskokwim interpreter was gone. And now
it seemed likely that we should lose our way in this wilderness. At last
we were entirely at a loss, the boy returning on the one side and I on
the other from wide detours, in which we had found no sign at all. The
snow still fell heavily; there lay more than a foot of it upon the late
crust; trail or sign of a trail, on the snow or above it, was not at
all.

[Sidenote: THE DOG GUIDES]

Then occurred one of the most remarkable things I have known in all my
journeyings. Straight ahead in the middle distance I spied two stray
dogs making a direct course towards us; not wandering about, but
evidently going somewhere. Now there are no such things as unattached
dogs in Alaska; any dog entirely detached from human ownership and some
sort of human maintenance would soon be a dead dog. The explanation,
full of hope, sprang at once to the boy's mind. The dogs must belong to
the native encampment some six miles back, and they had been to the
road-house for what scraps they could pick up, and were returning. It
was probably a daily excursion and they had doubtless followed their
accustomed trail. So it turned out. All the way to that road-house,
eight miles farther, we followed the trail left by those dogs, growing
fainter and fainter indeed as the new snow fell upon it, but still
discernible until we had almost reached the road-house. It led across
open swampy wastes, and presently across two considerable lakes, over
which we should never have been able to find our way, for the trail
swung to one hand or the other and did not leave the lake in the same
general direction by which it had reached it. Walter cut a bundle of
boughs and staked the trail out as we pursued it, lest we should return
this way, but from the moment we saw the dogs there was never any
question about the trail; they kept it perfectly. We were four and a
half hours making the eight miles or so to Nicoli's Village and the
road-house, but we might have been days making it but for those dogs.
And at the road-house we learned that the boy's theory of their
movements was the right one. They came across the twelve or fourteen
miles every day for such scraps as they could pick up.

[Sidenote: THE WILDERNESS POET]

So here was our first white man in sixteen days, an intelligent man of
meagre education, with a great bent for versifying. A courteous approval
of one set of verse brought upon us the accumulated output of years in
the wilderness without much opportunity of audience, as one supposes,
and most of the afternoon and evening was thus spent. Amidst the
overwrought sentimentality and faulty scansion which marked most of the
pieces was one simple little poem that struck a true note, said its
little say, and quit--without a superfluous word. Its author set no
store by it at all compared with his more pretentious and meretricious
work; yet it was the one poem in the whole mass. It described the
writing of a letter to his father; he had spent all he had in
prospecting and working a small claim, and had just realised that a
year's labour was gone for naught. His father would worry if he got no
word at all, but there was no use telling the old man he was broke, so
he just wrote that he was well, and that was all. The old man would come
pretty near understanding anyway. In simple lines that scanned and
rhymed naturally, that was what the three or four stanzas said. And it
was so typical of many a man's situation in this country, gave so simply
and well the reason why many men cease writing to their relatives at
all, that it pleased me and seemed of value. That note came from the
heart and from the life's experience.

Nicoli's Village is a very small place with a mere handful of people,
situated on the South Fork of the Kuskokwim some forty miles by river
above the junction of the forks. Before the epidemics devastated it it
had been a considerable native community. A Greek church, which the
natives built entirely themselves, and which boasted a large painted
icon of sorts, was the most important building in the place, and was
served by the lay minister referred to before. Thus far the Kuskokwim
is navigable for vessels of light draught, and a small stern-wheel
steamboat lay wintering upon the bank.

[Sidenote: ROAD-HOUSES]

Our way now left the Kuskokwim and struck across country to a point just
below the junction of the forks, and then across country again to a
tributary of the right bank, the Takotna; with a general northerly
direction. Road-houses there indeed were, in the crudity and discomfort
of their first season, and other evidences of the proximity of the white
man. Here were two men camped, hunting moose for the Iditarod market,
more than a hundred and twenty-five miles away, and here, at the end of
the second day, near the mouth of the Takotna, was the new post of the
Commercial Company in the charge of an old acquaintance who welcomed us
warmly and entertained us most hospitably. After camping and road-house
experience of nearly three weeks, a comfortable bed and well-spread
table, and the general unmistakable ménage of a home-making woman are
very highly enjoyed. That night the whole population of the settlement,
fourteen persons, gathered in the store for Divine service.

Sixteen miles farther on was another settlement, the "Upper Takotna"
Post, with a rival company established and some larger population. Here,
also, we spent a night with old Fairbanks acquaintances. We were yet a
hundred miles from Iditarod City, and the trail lay over a very rugged,
hilly country, up one creek to its head, over a divide, and down
another, in the way of the usual cross-country traverse.

There had not been so much snowfall in this section, but the weather
began to be very severe. The thermometer fell to -45° and -50° and -55°
on three successive nights, and all day long rose not above -20°, with a
keen wind. The cost of transporting supplies to the road-houses on this
trail justified the high prices charged--one dollar and a half for a
poor meal of rabbits and beans and bacon, or ptarmigan and beans and
bacon, and one dollar for a lunch of coffee, bread and butter, and dried
fruit. But no such exigency could be pleaded to excuse the dirt and
discomfort and lack of the commonest provision of outhouse decency at
most of these places--'twas mere shiftlessness. There is not often much
middle ground in Alaskan road-houses; they are either very good in their
way or very bad; either kept by professional victuallers who take pride
in them or by idle incompetents who make an easy living out of the
necessities of travellers. One wishes that some of the old-time
travellers who used to wax so eloquently indignant over the inns in the
Pyrenees could make a winter journey in the interior of Alaska.

[Illustration: "THE 'SUMMIT' IS HIGH ABOVE TIMBER-LINE AND THE TRAIL
PURSUES A HOGBACK RIDGE FOR A MILE AND A HALF AT THE SUMMIT LEVEL."]

[Illustration: A STREET IN IDITAROD CITY.]

One thing pleased me at these road-houses. The only reading-matter in
any of them consisted of magazines bearing the rubber stamp of Saint
Matthew's Reading-Room at Fairbanks, part of a five-hundred-pound cargo
of magazines which the mission launch _Pelican_ brought to the Iditarod
the previous summer; virtually the only reading-matter in the whole
camp. It was pleasant to know that we had been able to avert the real
calamity of a total absence of anything to read for a whole winter
throughout this wide district. But, although they were brought to the
Iditarod and distributed absolutely free, each of these magazines had
cost the road-house keeper twenty-five cents for carriage over the trail
from Iditarod City, and they had been read to death. Some of them were
so black and greasy from continued handling that the print at the edges
of the pages was almost unreadable.

These creeks swarmed with ptarmigan, and it was well they did, for the
new camp was ill supplied with food, and we found ourselves in a region
of growing scarcity as we approached the Iditarod. The ptarmigan seem to
have supplemented the meagre stocks in the Iditarod during this winter
of 1910-11 as effectively as the rabbits did in the Fairbanks camp in
the scarce winter of 1904-5. In place after place the whole creek
valley, where it was open, was crisscrossed with ptarmigan tracks, and
the birds rose in coveys, uttering their harsh, guttural cry at every
turn of the trail.

The summit between the head of Moose Creek and the head of Bonanza Creek
is again a watershed between the waters of the Kuskokwim and the waters
of the Yukon; for Moose Creek is tributary to the Takotna and Bonanza
Creek is tributary to Otter Creek, which is tributary to the Iditarod
River. The "summit" is high above timber-line, and when the trail has
reached it it does not descend immediately but pursues a hogback ridge
for a mile and a half at about the summit level. We passed over it in
clear, bright weather without difficulty, but it would be a bad passage
in wind or snow or fog. The rugged, broken country, with small, rounded
domes of hills, stretched away in all directions, a maze of little
valleys threading in and out amongst them.

[Sidenote: PLACE-NAMES]

The Bonanza Creek road-house was by far the best of any between the
Kuskokwim and the Iditarod, and showed what can be done for comfort,
even under adverse circumstances, by a couple who care and try. But how
the names of gold-bearing creeks, or creeks that are expected to be
gold-bearing are repeated again and again in every new camp! I once
counted up the following list of mining place-names in Alaska: Bonanza
Creeks, 10; Eldorados and Little Eldorados, 10; Nugget Creeks or
Gulches, 17; Gold Creeks, 12; Gold Runs, 7. Nor is it only in creeks
with auriferous deposit or expectation of auriferous deposit that this
reduplication occurs; there are Bear Creeks, 16; Boulder Creeks, 13;
Moose Creeks, 13; Willow Creeks, 17; Canyon Creeks, 12; Glacier Creeks,
14.

The imagination of the average prospector is not his most active
faculty, but even when his imagination is given play and he names a
place "Twilight," as he did the original settlement at this base of
supplies, the ineradicable prose of trade comes along the next summer
and changes it to "Iditarod City." There must have been some remarkable
personality strong enough to repress the "chamber of commerce" at
Tombstone, Arizona, or the place would have lost its distinctive name so
soon as it grew large enough to have mercantile establishments instead
of stores.

[Sidenote: IDITAROD CITY]

We went through "Discovery Otter" and into "Flat City," on Flat Creek,
the jealous rival of Iditarod City, and so over the hills to Iditarod
City, on the wings of a storm. The wind whirled the snow behind us and
drove the sled along almost on top of the dogs. In its bleak situation
and its exposure to the full force of the wind, Iditarod City reminds
one of Nome or Candle on the Seward Peninsula. The hills and flats that
surround it are in the main treeless, and the snow drifts and drives
over everything. Almost all the week that we spent in the town it was
smothered up in a howling wind-storm, so that it was quite a serious
undertaking to walk a block or two along the streets. Deep drifts were
piled up on all the corners and on the lee side of all buildings. We
reached Iditarod City on Monday, the 13th of March. Until the following
Friday morning was no cessation or moderation of the wind-storm; and
this, they told us, represented most of the weather since the 1st of
January.

Overgrown and overdone in every way, the place presented all the
features, sordid and otherwise, of a raw mining town. Prices had risen
enormously on all manner of supplies, for everything that was not
actually "short" was believed to be "cornered." Bacon was ninety cents a
pound; butter one dollar and a half a pound; flour was twenty dollars a
hundred pounds, and most things in like ratio. Some said the grub was
not in the camp; others that the tradesmen had it cached away waiting
for the still higher prices they believed would obtain before fresh
supplies could arrive in July. There was a general feeling of
disappointment and discouragement, enhanced by discomfort and actual
suffering from the terrible stormy weather of the winter and the
exorbitant and growing price of provisions. Many men without occupation
were living on one meal a day. The saloons and the parasitical classes,
male and female, seemed to flourish and to play their usual prominent
part in the life of such places. The doings of notorious women whose
sobriquets seemed household words, the lavish expenditures of certain
men upon them, the presents of diamonds they received, with the amount
paid for them, constituted a large part of the general talk.

One is compelled to admire the vigour and enthusiastic enterprise,
daunted by no difficulty, that is displayed in the wonderfully rapid
upraising of a new mining-camp town. The building goes far ahead of the
known wealth of the camp and commonly far ahead of the reasonable
expectation. But the element of chance is so important a factor in
placer mining that the whole thing partakes more of the nature of
gambling than of a commercial venture. Any new camp may suddenly present
the world with a new Klondike; with riches abundant and to spare for
every one who is fortunate enough to be on the spot. Here was Flat Creek
with a surprisingly rich deposit; why should there not be a dozen such
amidst the multitudinous creeks of the district? How could any one know
that it would be almost the only creek on which pay would be found at
all? For there is no law about the distribution of gold deposits; there
is not even a general rule that has not its notable exceptions. It is
very generally believed by the old prospectors and miners that somewhere
in the Bible may be found these words, "Silver occurs in veins, but gold
is where you find it," which of course, is a mere misreading or faulty
remembering of a verse in the Book of Job: "Surely there is a vein for
the silver and a place for the gold where they fine it" (refine it). But
that "gold is where you find it" is about the only law touching
auriferous deposits that holds universally good.

Three long parallel streets of one and two story wooden buildings, with
cross streets connecting them, made up the town. Because the country is
poorly timbered, the usual log construction had yielded in the main to
framed buildings, and great quantities of lumber had been brought the
previous summer from Fairbanks, and even from Nome and the outside, to
supplement the low-grade output of two local mills. But the price of
building materials had been very high, and the average dwelling was very
small and incommodious. People accustomed to the comparative luxury of
the older camps had suffered a good deal from the lack of all domestic
conveniences in this new will-o'-the-wisp of an eldorado.

So there the town stretched away, lumber and paper,--the usual
tinder-box Alaskan construction--stores slap up against one another,
with no alleyways between; in the busiest part of it and along the
water-front even an adequate provision of side streets grudged;
furnace-heated and kiln-dried and gasoline-lit; waiting for the careless
match and the fanning wind and the five minutes' start that should send
it all up in smoke. A week after we left it came; as it came to Dawson,
as it came to Nome, as it came to Fairbanks, without teaching any lesson
or leaving any precautionary regulations on the statute book to save
men from their own competitive greed. Two or three weeks after the fire,
however, it was all rebuilt, and a plunging local bank held mortgages on
most of the structures for the cost of the new material--and holds them
yet.

[Sidenote: THOUSANDS WITHOUT CHURCH]

With at least a thousand people resident in the town, not to mention the
thousands more out upon the creeks and at Flat City and "Discovery[G]
Otter," there was no minister of religion of any sort in the whole
region, nor had public Divine service been conducted since the occasion
of the _Pelican's_ visit the previous summer. Yet there were many in the
place who sorely missed the opportunities of worship. Twice on Sunday
the largest dancing hall in the town was crowded at service; at night it
could have been filled a second time with those unable to get in.

Places like this present very difficult problems to those desirous of
providing for their religious need. To occupy them at all they should be
occupied at once when yet eligible sites may be had for the staking; if
they prosper, to come into them later means buying at a high price. Yet
what seventh son of a seventh son shall have foresight enough to tell
the fortunes of them? The North is strewn with "cities" of one winter.
Nor is the selection of suitable men to minister to such communities a
simple matter. Amidst the overthrow of all the usual criteria of
conduct, the fading out of the usual dividing lines and the blending
into one another of the usual divisions, it requires a tactful and
prudent man "to keep the happy mean between too much stiffness in
refusing and to much easiness in admitting" variations from conventional
standards. His point of view, if he is to have any influence whatever,
must not exclude the point of view of the great majority; he must accept
the situation in order to have any chance of improving the situation.
And yet in the fundamentals of character and conduct he must be
unswerving. And if on any such fundamental the battle gauge is thrown
down, he must take it up and fight the quarrel out at whatever cost.

We left Iditarod City on Monday, the 20th of March, the dogs the fatter
and fresher for their week's rest, resolved not to return by the
Kuskokwim but to take the beaten trail out to the Yukon, and so all the
way up that stream to Fort Yukon. The monthly mail had arrived a few
days previously--a monthly mail was all that the thousands of men in
this camp could secure--and had gone out again the very next morning,
before people had time to answer their letters, before the registered
mail had even been delivered. So our departure for the Yukon was eagerly
seized upon and advertised as a means of despatching probably the last
mail that would go outside over the ice. I was sworn in as special
carrier, and a heavy sack of first-class mail added to our load as far
as Tanana. The first stage of thirty miles led to Dikeman, a town at the
headwaters of ordinary steamboat navigation of the Iditarod River, at
which the Commercial Company had built a depot and extensive warehouse,
since in the main abandoned. Two streets of cabins lined the bank, but
forty or fifty souls comprised the population, and almost all of them
gathered for Divine service that night.

[Sidenote: THE "MOVING OF THE MEAT"]

From Dikeman to Dishkaket, on the Innoko River, a distance of some
seventy miles, our route lay over one of the dreariest and most dismal
regions in all Alaska. It is one succession of lakes and swamps, with
narrow, almost knife-edge, ridges between, fringed with stunted spruce.
Far as the eye could reach to right and left the country was the same;
it is safe to say broadly that all the land between the Iditarod and
Innoko Rivers is of this character. We passed over it in mild weather,
but it must be a terrible country to cross in storm or through deep
snow. For ten miles at a stretch there was scarcely a place where a man
might make a decent camp. At a midway road-house was gathered the
greatest assemblage of dogs and loaded sleds I had ever seen together at
one time, each team with an Indian driver; they must have covered a
quarter or a third of a mile. It was a freight train engaged in
transporting a whole boat-load of butcher's meat to Iditarod City, the
cargo of a steamboat that had frozen in on the Yukon the previous
October or early November. All the winter through efforts had been made
to get this meat two hundred odd miles overland to its destination; but
the weather had been so stormy and the snow so deep that near the end of
March most of it was still on the way, and some yet far down the trail
towards the Yukon waiting for another trip of the teams.

Dishkaket was merely a native village on the Innoko River two or three
years before; but since three new trails from the Yukon come together
here--from Kaltag Nulato, and Lewis's Landing--and in the other
directions two trails branch off here, to the Innoko diggings at Ophir
and to the Iditarod, a store or two and a couple of road-houses had
sprung up.

From Dishkaket, after crossing the Innoko, we took the most northerly of
the three trails to the Yukon, the Lewis Cut-Off, a trail of a hundred
miles that strikes straight across country and reaches the Yukon eighty
miles farther up that stream than the Nulato trail and a hundred and
twenty miles farther up than the Kaltag trail. The Kaltag trail is the
trail to Nome; the Nulato trail is the mail trail simply because it
suits the contractors to throw business to Nulato. The Lewis Cut-Off is
the direct route, the shortest by about a hundred miles, but it was cut
by the private individual whose name it bears, and leads out to his
store and road-house on the Yukon; so a rival road-house was built close
by on the river and the prestige and advertisement of the "United States
mail route" thrown to the trail that covers one hundred unnecessary
miles--for no other reason than to deprive Lewis of the legitimate fruit
of his enterprise.

The character of the country changed so soon as the Innoko was crossed;
the wide swamps gave place to a broken, light-timbered country of ridges
and hollows, and the rough, laborious, horse-ruined trail across it made
bad travelling. "Buckskin Bill," with his cayuses, was also engaged in
"moving the meat." The measured miles, moreover, gave place to estimated
miles, and the nominal twenty-five we made the first day was probably
not much more than twenty.

[Sidenote: MILLINERY]

The first fifty miles of the country between the Innoko and the Yukon is
much the same, and we were climbing and descending ridges for a couple
of days. Then we crossed a high ridge and dropped out of Innoko waters
into the valley of the Yukatna, a tributary of the Yukon, and passed
down this valley for thirty or forty miles, and then across some more
broken country to the Yukon. At one of the road-houses a woman was
stopping, going in with three or four large sled loads of millinery and
"ladies' furnishings." We were told that the merchandise had cost her
twelve thousand dollars in Fairbanks, and that she expected to realise
thirty thousand dollars by selling it to the "sporting" women of the
Iditarod, now a whole winter debarred from "the latest imported French
fashions." This woman was dressed in overalls, like a man, and the
drivers of her teams, two white men and a native, cursed and swore and
used filthy language to the dogs in her presence. It always angers me to
hear an Indian curse; to hear one curse in the presence of a white woman
was particularly disgusting and exasperating; but what could one expect
when the white men put no slightest restraint upon themselves and the
woman seemed utterly indifferent? I called the Indian aside and spoke
very plainly to him, and he ceased his ribaldry; but the white men still
poured it out as they struggled to hitch their many dogs. At last I
could stand it no longer. "Madam," I said to the woman, "I don't know
who you are, save that you are a white woman, and as a white woman,
if I were you, I would make those blackguards treat me with more respect
than to use such language before me." She flushed and made no reply. The
men, who heard what I said, scowled and made no reply. Presently
dispositions were done and the train moved off, but I did not hear any
more foul language. This is set down here chiefly because it was the
first and only time in all his travels in Alaska that the writer heard
such language in such presence.

[Illustration: THE END OF THE PORTAGE TRAIL.]

[Illustration: ROUGH ICE ON THE YUKON.]

Another road-house was kept by a man who had been cook upon a recent
arctic expedition off the coast of Alaska, and he gave some interesting
inside information about an enterprise the published narrative of which
had always seemed unsatisfactory. It was just gossip from a drunken
scamp, but it filled several gaps in the book.

As we approached the Yukon we passed several meat caches where great
quarters of beef sewn up in burlap were piled on the side of the trail.
At one of these caches the camp-robbers had been at work industriously.
They had stripped the burlap from parts of several quarters, exposing
the fat, and had dug out and carried it away little by little until it
was all gone. The hard-frozen lean probably defied their best efforts;
at any rate, the fat offered less resistance. But where else in the
world could men dump quarters of beef beside the road and go off and
leave them for weeks with no more danger of depredation than the bills
of birds can effect?

A few miles from the river the rival road-house signs began to appear.
"Patronise Lewis; he cut this trail at his own expense," pleaded one.
"Why go five miles out of your way," sneered another. Lewis's
road-house _is_ across the wide Yukon, and there was no point in
crossing the river save one's determination to lend no countenance to
the spitefulness of these mail runners. So across the river we went and
were glad to be on the Yukon again. The next morning we encountered the
same rival signs at the point where the trail from Lewis's joined the
"mail trail."

[Sidenote: "TREASURE ISLAND"]

Most of our travelling was now upon the surface of the Yukon, and four
hundred and fifty miles of it stretched ahead of us ere our winter's
travel should end at Fort Yukon. Four hours brought us to the military
telegraph station at Melozi, and we were able to send word ahead that we
were safely out of the Kuskokwim wilderness. Then a portage was crossed
and then the river pursued again until with about thirty miles to our
credit we made camp. The days were lengthening out now, the weather
growing mild, although a keen, cold, down-river breeze was rarely
absent, and travel began to be pleasant and camping no hardship. We
preferred camping, on several scores, when the day's work had not been
too arduous, chief amongst them being that it gave more opportunity and
privacy for Walter's schooling. He was reading _Treasure Island_ aloud,
and I was getting as great pleasure from renewing as he from beginning
an acquaintance with that prince of all pirate stories. Kokrines and
Mouse Point one day, the next The Birches; we passed these well-known
Yukon landmarks, camping, after a run of thirty-eight miles, some six
miles beyond the last-named place, with a run of forty-four miles before
us to Tanana. I judged it too much; but the trail was greatly improved
and we decided to attempt it in one stage. A misreading of the watch, so
that I roused myself and Walter at 3.30 A. M. instead of 5.15 A. M., and
did not realise the mistake until the fire was made and it was not worth
while returning to bed, gave us a fine start and we made good progress.
Gold Mountain (so called, one supposes, because there is no gold there;
there is no other reason), Grant Creek, "Old Station" were passed by,
and at length Tanana loomed before us while yet ten miles away. In just
eleven hours we ran the forty-four miles, making, with three additional
miles out to the mission, forty-seven altogether, by far the longest
journey of the winter. We reached Tanana on the 1st of April, just six
weeks since we left.

[Sidenote: AN UNTRAVELLED RIVER]

We spent eight days at Tanana, including two Sundays, Passion Sunday and
Palm Sunday, but I was under an old promise to spend Easter there also.
Now, Easter, 1911, fell on the 16th of April, and for the
three-hundred-mile journey to Fort Yukon a period of ten or twelve days
at the least would be necessary, that might easily stretch to two weeks.
Travelling on the Yukon ice so late in April as this would involve was
not only fraught with great difficulty and discomfort, but also with
actual danger, and I had to beg to be absolved of my promise. Some
considerable preparation was on foot for the festival, and I was loath
to leave, for Tanana was then without any resident minister, but it
seemed foolish to take the chances that would have to be taken if we
stayed.

Five days of almost ceaseless snow-storm during our stay at Tanana did
not give prospect of good travelling, and, indeed, when we pulled out
from the mission on the Monday in Holy Week there was no sign of any
trail. From Tanana up to Fort Yukon there is very little travel; since
the whole of this long stretch of river was deprived of winter mail a
year or two before, no through travel at all. Cabins may usually be
found to camp in, but there are no road-houses. What travel still takes
place is local.

The journey divided itself into two roughly equal parts, a hundred and
fifty miles through the Lower Ramparts, and a hundred and fifty miles
through the Yukon Flats, almost all of it on the surface of the river.
It was hoped to reach Stephen's Village, a native settlement just within
the second half of the journey, for Easter.

Snow does not lie long at rest upon the river within the Ramparts, and
particularly within the narrow, cañon-like stretch of seventy-five miles
from Tanana to Rampart City. Violent and almost ceaseless down-stream
winds sweep the deep defile in the mountains through which the river
winds its course. In places the ice is bare of snow; in places the snow
is piled in huge, hardened drifts. So strong and so persistent is this
wind that it is often possible to skate over an uninterrupted black
surface of ice, polished like plate glass, for twenty miles on a
down-river journey. To make way over such a surface up-stream, against
such wind, is, however, almost impossible. The dogs get no footing and
the wind carries the sled where it listeth. The journey so far as
Rampart City has been described before; it will suffice now that it
took three days of toilsome battling against wind and bad surface, with
nights spent upon the floor of grimy cabins. So cold was the wind that
it is noted in my diary with surprise, on the 12th of April, that I had
worn fur cap, parkee, and muffler all day, as though it had been the
dead of winter instead of three weeks past the vernal equinox.

On Wednesday night there was Divine service at Rampart, and on Maundy
Thursday, after four miles upon the river, we took the portage of eleven
miles that cuts a chord to the arc of the greatest bend of the river
within the Ramparts and so saves nine miles. Three miles more took us to
the deserted cabin at the site of the abandoned coal-mine opposite the
mouth of the Mike Hess River, here confluent with the Yukon, and in that
cabin we spent the night, having had the high, bitter wind in our faces
all day. We hated to leave the shelter of the wooded portage and face
the blast of the last three miles.

[Sidenote: WIND AND SNOW]

We woke the next morning to a veritable gale of wind and snow, and lay
in the cabin till noon, occupied with the exercises of the solemn
anniversary. The wind having then abated somewhat and the snow ceased,
we sallied forth, still hopeful of making Stephen's Village for Easter.
But when we got down upon the river surface it became doubtful if we
could proceed, and as we turned the first bend we encountered a fresh
gale that did not fall short of a blizzard. The air was filled with
flying snow that stung our faces and blinded us. The dogs' muzzles
became incrusted with snow and their eyes filled with it so that it was
hard to keep them facing it. I could not see the boy at all when he was
a hundred feet ahead of the team. We struggled along for four miles,
and, since it was then evident that we could not go much farther without
useless risk, we turned to a spot on the bank where Walter knew another
deserted cabin to stand; for he knows every foot of this section of the
river and once spent a summer, camped at the coal-mine, fishing. The
spot was reached, but the cabin was gone. The fish rack still stood
there, but the cabin was burned down. There was nothing for it but to
return to the coal-mine cabin; so, for the first and only time in all my
journeyings, it was necessary to abandon a day's march that had been
entered upon and go back whence we had come. We ran before the gale at
great speed and were within the cabin again by 2.30 P. M. All the
evening and all night the storm raged, and I was in two minds about
running back to Rampart before it for Easter, since it was now out of
the question to reach Stephen's Village. If the season had not been so
far advanced this is what I should have done, but it would set us back
three days more on the journey, and on reflection I was not willing to
take that chance with the break-up so near.

So on the morning of Easter Eve we sallied up-stream again, snow falling
and driving heavily, and the wind still strong but with yesterday's keen
edge blunted. By the time we had beaten around the long bend up which we
had fought our way the day before, the snow had ceased, and by noon the
wind had dropped and the sun was shining, and in a few moments of his
unobscured strength all the loose snow on the sled was melted--a
warning of the rapidity with which the general thaw would proceed once
the skies were clear. That night saw us in the habitable though dirty,
deserted cabin at Salt Creek (so called, one supposes, because the water
of it is perfectly fresh) at which we had hoped to lodge the previous
night.

[Sidenote: ALASKAN "FORTS"]

Buoyed by the hope of doing a double stage in a clear, windless day and
thus reaching Stephen's Village for service at night, we made a very
early start that beautiful Easter morning. But it was not to be. Such
trail as there was ran high up on the bank ice--level, doubtless, when
it was made much earlier in the season, but now at a slope towards the
middle of the river through the falling of the water, and seamed with
great cracks. Such a trail, called a "sidling" trail in the vernacular
of mushing, is always difficult and laborious to travel, for the sled
slips continually off it into the loose snow or the ice cracks, and
often for long stretches at a time one man must hold up the nose of the
sled while the other toils at the handle-bars. In one place, while thus
holding the front of the sled on the trail, Walter slipped into an ugly
ice crack concealed by drifted snow, and so wedged his foot that I had
difficulty in extricating him. The last two bends of the river within
the Ramparts seemed interminable and it was 6.30 P. M., with twelve
hours' travel behind us, when we reached old Fort Hamlin, on the verge
of the Yukon Flats. These "forts," it might be explained, if one chose
to pursue the elucidation of Alaskan nomenclature in the same strain,
are so called because they never had any defences and never needed any.
As a matter of fact, in the early days, when the Hudson Bay Company
made its first establishments on the upper river, there was supposed to
be some need of fortification, and Fort Selkirk and Fort Yukon were
stockaded. Fort Selkirk, indeed, was sacked and burned sixty years ago,
but not by Yukon Indians. The Chilkats from the coast, indignant at the
loss of their middle-man profits by the invasion of the interior,
crossed the mountains, descended the river, and destroyed the post. It
thus became customary to call a trading-post a "fort," and every little
point where a store and a warehouse stood was so dignified. Hence Fort
Reliance, Fort Hamlin, Fort Adams.

For years Fort Hamlin had been quite deserted, but now smoke issued from
the stovepipe and dogs gave tongue at our approach, and we found a white
man with an Esquimau wife from Saint Michael and a half-breed child
dwelling there and carrying a few goods for sale. With him we made our
lodging, and with him and his family said our evening service of Easter,
and so to bed, thoroughly tired.

[Sidenote: TRAVELLING BY NIGHT]

A mile beyond Fort Hamlin the Ramparts suddenly cease and the wide
expanse of the Yukon Flats opens at once. Ten miles or so brought us to
Stephen's Village, where we had been long expected and where a very busy
day was spent. A number of Indians were gathered and there were children
to baptize and couples to marry, as well as the lesson of the season to
teach. It was a great disappointment that we had been unable to get here
before, and matter of regret that, being here at such labour, only so
short a time could be spent. But the closing season called to us
loudly. A mild, warm day set all the banks running with melting snow and
made the surface of the river mushy. There was really no time to lose,
for the next seventy-five miles was to give us the most difficult and
disagreeable travelling of the journey. Here, in the Flats, where is
greatest need of travel direction on the whole river, was no trail at
all beyond part of the first day's journey. Within the Ramparts the
river is confined in one channel; however bad the travelling may be,
there is no danger of losing the way; but in the Flats the river divides
into many wide channels and these lead off into many more back sloughs,
with low, timbered banks and no salient landmarks at all. Behind us were
the bluffs of the Ramparts, already growing faint; afar off on the
horizon, to the right, were the dim shapes of the Beaver Mountains. All
the rest was level for a couple of hundred miles.

A local trail to a neighbouring wood-chopper's took us some twelve
miles, and then we were at a loss. The general direction we knew, and
previous journeys both in winter and summer gave us some notion of the
river bends to follow, but we wallowed and floundered until late at
night before we reached the cabin we were bound for, the snow exceeding
soft and wet for hours in the middle of the day.

The time had plainly come to change our day travel into night travel,
for freezing was resumed each night after the sun was set, and the
surface grew hard again. So at this cabin we lay all the next day, with
an interesting recluse of these parts who knows many passages of
Shakespeare by heart, and who drew us a chart of our course to the next
habitation, marking every bend to be followed and the place where the
river must be crossed. But there is always difficulty in getting a new
travel schedule under way, and we did not leave until five in the
morning instead of at two as we had planned. This gave us insufficient
time to make the day's march before the sun softened the snow, and
moccasins grew wet, and snow-shoe strings began to stretch, and the
webbing underfoot to yield and sag--and we had to content ourselves with
half a stage. By nine P. M. we were off again and did pretty well until
the night grew so dark that we could no longer distinguish our
landmarks. Then we went to the bank and built a big fire and made a pot
of tea and sat and dozed around it for a couple of hours or so until the
brief darkness of Alaskan spring was overpast, and the dawn began to
give light enough to see our way again.

When our course lay on the open river, the snow had crust enough to hold
us upon our snow-shoes; but when it took us through little sheltered
sloughs, the crust was too thin and we broke through all the time, and
that makes slow, painful travel. At last we came to a portage that cuts
off a number of miles, but the snow slope by which the top of the bank
should be reached had a southern exposure and was entirely melted and
gone. The dogs had to be unhitched, the sled to be unloaded, the stuff
packed in repeated journeys up the steep bank, and the sled hauled up
with a rope. Then came the repacking and reloading and the rehitching;
and when the portage was crossed the same thing had to be done to get
down to the river bed again. Twice more on that day the process was gone
through, and each time it took nigh an hour to get up the bank, so that
it was around noon, and the snow miserably wet and mushy again, when we
reached Beaver and went to bed at the only road-house between Fort Yukon
and Tanana.

"Beaver City" owes its existence to quartz prospects in the Chandalar,
in which men of money and influence in the East were interested. The
Alaska Road Commission had built a trail some years before from the
Chandalar diggings out to the Yukon, striking the river at this point,
and on the opposite side of the river another trail is projected and
"swamped out" direct to Fairbanks. The opening up of this route was
expected to bring much travel through Beaver, and a town site was staked
and many cabins built. But "Chandalar quartz" remains an interesting
prospect, and the Chandalar placers have not proved productive, and all
but a few of the cabins at "Beaver City" are unoccupied. If "the
Chandalar" should ever make good, "Beaver City" will be its river port.

[Sidenote: LAST DAY]

We left Beaver at eleven P. M. on Friday night, hoping in two long
all-night runs to cover the eighty miles and reach Fort Yukon by Sunday
morning. Here was the first trail since we left Stephen's Village and
the first fairly good trail since we left Tanana, for there had been
some recent travel between Fort Yukon and Beaver. Here for the first
time we had no need of snow-shoes, and when they have been worn
virtually all the winter through and nigh a couple of thousand miles
travelled in them, walking is strange at first in the naked moccasin. It
is a blessed relief, however, to be rid of even the lightest of trail
snow-shoes. We stepped out gaily into a beautiful clear night, with a
sharp tang of frost in the air, and even the dogs rejoiced in the
knowledge that the end of the journey was at hand. All night long we
made good time and kept it up without a stop until eight o'clock in the
morning, when we reached an inhabited but just then unoccupied cabin and
ate supper or breakfast as one chooses to call it and went to bed,
having covered fully half the distance to Fort Yukon. About noon we were
rudely awakened by one of the usual Alaskan accompaniments of
approaching summer. The heat of the sun was melting the snow above us,
and water came trickling through the dirt roof upon our bed. We moved to
a dry part of the cabin and slept again until the evening, and at nine
P. M. entered upon what we hoped would be our last run.

But once more our plans to spend Sunday were frustrated. The trail led
through dry sloughs from which the advancing thaw had removed the snow
in great patches. Sometimes the sled had to be hauled over bare sand;
sometimes wide detours had to be made to avoid such sand; sometimes
pools of open water covered with only that night's ice lay across our
path. By eight o'clock in the morning we estimated that we were not more
than seven or eight miles from Fort Yukon. But already the snow grew
soft and our feet wet, and the dogs were very weary with the eleven
hours' mushing. It would take a long time and much toil to plough
through slush, even that seven or eight miles. So I gave the word to
stop, and we made an open-air camp on a sunny bank, and after breakfast
we covered our heads in the blankets from the glare of the sun, and
slept till five. Then we ate our last trail meal, and were washed up and
packed up and hitched up an hour and more before the snow was frozen
enough for travel. A couple of hours' run took us to Fort Yukon, and so
ended the winter journey of 1910-11, on the 23d of April, having been
started on the 17th of November. We were back none too soon. Every day
we should have found travelling decidedly worse. In a few more days the
river would have begun to open in places, and only the middle would be
safe for travel, with streams of water against either bank and no way of
getting ashore. Seventeen days later the ice was gone out and the Yukon
flowing bank full.

CHAPTER XI

THE NATIVES OF ALASKA


WHEN one contemplates the native people of the interior of Alaska in the
mass, when, with the stories told by the old men and old women of the
days before they saw the white man in mind, one reconstructs that
primitive life, lacking any of the implements, the conveniences, the
alleviations of civilisation, the chief feeling that arises is a feeling
of admiration and respect.

What a hardy people they must have been! How successfully for untold
generations did they pit themselves against the rigour of this most
inhospitable climate! With no tool but the stone-axe and the flint
knife, with no weapon but the bow and arrow and spear, with no material
for fish nets but root fibres, or for fish-hooks or needles but bone,
and with no means of fire making save two dry sticks--one wonders at the
skill and patient endurance that rendered subsistence possible at all.
And there follows quickly upon such wonder a hot flush of indignation
that, after so conquering their savage environment or accommodating
themselves to it, that they not only held their own but increased
throughout the land, they should be threatened with a wanton
extermination now that the resources of civilisation are opened to them,
now that tools and weapons and the knowledge of easier and more
comfortable ways of life are available.

The natives of the interior are of two races, the Indian and the
Esquimau. The Indian inhabits the valley of the Yukon down to within
three or four hundred miles of its mouth; the Esquimau occupies the
lower reaches of the Yukon and the Kuskokwim and the whole of the rivers
that drain into the Arctic Ocean west and north. These inland Esquimaux
are of the same race as the coast Esquimaux and constitute an
interesting people, of whom something has been said in the account of
journeys through their country.

[Sidenote: THE ATHABASCANS]

The Indians of the interior are of one general stock, the Athabascan, as
it is called, and of two main languages derived from a common root but
differing as much perhaps as Spanish and Portuguese. The language of the
upper Yukon (and by this term in these pages is meant the upper American
Yukon) is almost identical with the language of the lower Mackenzie,
from which region, doubtless, these people came, and with it have always
maintained intercourse. The theory of the Asiatic origin of the natives
of interior Alaska has always seemed fanciful and far-fetched to the
writer. The same translations of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer
serve for the lower Mackenzie and the upper Yukon and are in active use
to-day through all that wide region, despite minor dialectical
variations.

Near the lower ramparts of the Yukon, at Stephen's Village, the language
changes and the new tongue maintains itself, though with continually
increasing dialectical differences, until the Indians overlap the
Esquimaux, six hundred miles farther down.

Fort Yukon is the most populous place on the river, and the last place
on the river, where the upper language, or Takhud, is spoken. A stretch
of one hundred and fifty miles separates it from the next native
village, and the inhabitants of that village are not intelligible to the
Fort Yukon Indians--an unintelligibility which seems to speak of long
ages of little intercourse.

       *       *       *       *       *

The history of the migrations of the Indians from the Athabascan or
Mackenzie region is impossible to trace now. It is highly probable that
the movement was by way of the Porcupine River. And it would seem that
there must have been two distinct migrations: one that passed down the
Yukon to the Tanana district and spread thence up the Tanana River and
up the Koyukuk; and long after, as one supposes, a migration that
peopled the upper Yukon. A portion of this last migration must have gone
across country to the Ketchumstock and the upper Tanana, for the
inhabitants of the upper Tanana do not speak the Tanana tongue, which is
the tongue of the Middle Yukon but a variant of the tongue of the upper
Yukon.

[Illustration: A DOCILE FOLK, EAGER FOR INSTRUCTION.]

[Illustration: THE MISSION TYPE.]

[Illustration: WILD AND SHY.]

How long ago these migrations took place there is not the slightest
knowledge to base even a surmise upon. The natives themselves have no
records nor even traditions, and the first point of contact between
white men and the natives of the interior is within three quarters of a
century ago. It may have been two or three families only which
penetrated to this region or to that and settled there, and what
pressure started them on their wanderings no one will ever know. Perhaps
some venturesome hunter pursuing his game across the highlands that
separate the Mackenzie from the Yukon was disabled and compelled to
remain until the summer, and then discovered the salmon that made their
way up the tributaries of the Porcupine. The Mackenzie has no salmon. Or
a local tribal quarrel may have sent fugitives over the divide.

When first the white man came to the upper Yukon, in 1846 and 1847, no
one knew that it was the same river at the mouth of which the Russians
had built Redoubt Saint Michael ten or twelve years before. The natives
of the upper river knew nothing about the lower river. It is an easy
matter to float down the Yukon for a thousand miles in a birch-bark
canoe, but an exceedingly difficult matter to come up again. It was not
until the voyageurs of the Hudson Bay Company, in their adventurous
fur-trading expeditions, met at the mouth of the Tanana River the agents
of the Russian Fur Company, come up from Nulato on the same quest, that
the identity of the Yukon and Kwikpak Rivers was discovered; and that
seems to have been well past the middle of the century. In the map of
North America that the writer first used at school, the Yukon flowed
north into the Arctic Ocean, parallel with the Mackenzie.

[Sidenote: AN INOFFENSIVE PEOPLE]

The Indians of the interior of Alaska are a gentle and kindly and
tractable people. They have old traditions of bloody tribal warfare that
have grown in ferocity, one supposes, with the lapse of time, for it is
very difficult for one who knows them to believe that so mild a race
could ever have been pugnacious or bloodthirsty. Whether it were that
the exigencies of subsistence under arctic conditions demanded almost
all their energies, or that a realisation of their constant dependence
upon one another checked the play of passion, they differ most widely
and, it seems certain, always differed most widely in character from the
Indians of the American plains. A personal knowledge of the greater part
of all the natives of interior Alaska, gained by living amongst them and
travelling from village to village during seven or eight years,
furnishes but a single instance of an Indian man guilty of any sort of
violence against another Indian or against a white man--except under the
influence of liquor.

It is true that there are unquestioned murders that have been
committed--murders of white men at that; but in the sixty years from the
Nulato massacre of 1851, over the whole vast interior, these crimes can
be counted on the fingers of one hand. They are not a revengeful people.
They do not cherish the memory of injuries and await opportunities of
repayment; that trait is foreign to their character. On the contrary,
they are exceedingly placable and bear no malice. Moreover, they are
very submissive, even to the point of being imposed upon. In fact, they
are decidedly a timid people in the matter of personal encounter. In all
these characteristics they differ from the North American Indian
generally as he appears in history.

They are capable of hard work, though apparently not of continuous hard
work; they will cheerfully support great privation and fatigue; but
when the immediate necessity is past they enjoy long periods of feasting
and leisure. Having no property nor desire of property, save their
clothes, their implements and weapons, and the rude furnishings of their
cabins, there is no incentive to hard and continuous work.

After all, where is the high and peculiar virtue that lies in the
performance of continuous hard work? Why should any one labour
incessantly? This is the question the Indian would ask, and one is not
always sure that the mills of Massachusetts and the coal-mines of
Pennsylvania return an entirely satisfactory answer. As regards thrift,
the Indian knows little of it; but the average white man of the country
does not know much more. There is little difference as regards thrift
between wasting one's substance in a "potlatch," which is a feast for
all comers, and wasting it in drunkenness, which is a feast for the
liquor sellers, save that one is barbarous and the other civilised, as
the terms go.

It would seem that the general timidity of the native character is the
reason for a very general untruthfulness, though there one must speak
with qualification and exception. There are Indians whose word may be
taken as unhesitatingly as the word of any white man, and there are
white men in the country whose word carries no more assurance than the
word of any Indian. The Indian is prone to evasion and quibbling rather
than to downright lying, though there are many who are utterly
unreliable and untrustworthy.

[Sidenote: SEXUAL MORALITY]

In the matter of sexual morality the Indian standards are very low,
though certainly not any lower than the standards of the average white
man in the country. One is forced to this constant comparison; the white
man in the country is the only white man the Indian knows anything
about. To the Indian a physical act is merely a physical act; all down
his generations there has been no moral connotation therewith, and it is
hard to change the point of view of ages when it affects personal
indulgence so profoundly. The white man has been taught, down as many
ages, perhaps, that these physical acts have moral connotation and are
illicit when divorced therefrom, yet he is as careless and immoral in
this country as the Indian is careless and _un_moral. And the white
man's careless and immoral conduct is the chief obstacle which those who
would engraft upon the Indian the moral consciousness must contend
against.

The Indian woman is not chaste because the Indian man does not demand
chastity of her, does not set any special value upon her chastity as
such. And the example of the chastity which the white man demands of his
women, though he be not chaste himself, is an example with which the
native of Alaska has not come much into contact. Too often, in the
vicinity of mining camps, the white women who are most in evidence are
of another class.

[Sidenote: GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS]

The Indian is commonly intelligent and teachable, and in most cases
eager to learn and eager that his children may learn. Here it becomes
necessary to deal with a difficult and somewhat contentious matter that
one would rather let alone. The government has undertaken the education
of the Indian, and has set up a bureau charged with the establishment
and conduct of native schools.

There are five such schools on the Yukon between Eagle and Tanana,
including these two points, amongst Indians all of whom belong to the
Episcopal Church, and five more between Tanana and Anvik, amongst
natives divided in allegiance between the Episcopal and the Roman
Catholic Churches. Below Anvik to the river's mouth the natives are
divided between the Roman and the Greek Churches, and they are outside
the scope of this book. On the tributaries of the Yukon the only native
schools are conducted by the missions of the Episcopal Church, on the
Koyukuk and Tanana Rivers, and have no connection with the government.

When, somewhat late in the day, the government set its hand to the
education of the natives, mission schools had been conducted for many
years at the five stations of the Episcopal Church above Tanana and at
the various mission stations below that point. The Bureau of Education
professed its earnest purpose of working in harmony with the mission
authorities, and upon this profession it secured deeds of gift for
government school sites within the mission reservations from the Bishop
of Alaska.

It cannot be stated, upon a survey of the last five or six years, that
this profession has been carried out. The administration of the Bureau
of Education has shared too much the common fault of other departments
of the government in a detached and lofty, not to say supercilious,
attitude. Things are not necessarily right because a government bureau
orders them, nor are government officials invested with superior wisdom
merely by reason of their connection with Washington. It is just as
important for a government school as for a mission school to be in
harmony with its environment, to adapt itself to the needs of the people
it designs to serve; and that harmony and adaptation may only be secured
by a single-minded study of the situation and of the habits and
character, the occupations and resources of the people.

To keep a school in session when the population of a village is gone on
its necessary occasions of hunting or trapping, and to have the annual
recess when all the population is returned again, is folly, whoever
orders it, in accord with what time-honoured routine soever, and this
has not infrequently been done. Moreover, it is folly to fail to
recognise that the apprenticeship of an Indian boy to the arts by which
he must make a living, the arts of hunting and trapping, is more
important than schooling, however important the latter may be, and that
any talk--and there has been loud talk--of a compulsory education law
which shall compel such boys to be in school at times when they should
be off in the wilds with their parents, is worse than mere folly, and
would, if carried out, be a fatal blunder. If such boys grow up
incompetent to make a living out of the surrounding wilderness, whence
shall their living come?

The next step would be the issuing of rations, and that would mean the
ultimate degradation and extinction of the natives. When the question is
stated in its baldest terms, is the writer perverse and barbarous and
uncivilised if he avow his belief that a race of hardy, peaceful,
independent, self-supporting illiterates is of more value and worthy of
more respect than a race of literate paupers? Be it remembered also that
many of these "illiterates" can read the Bible in their own tongue and
can make written communication with one another in the same--very
scornful as the officials of the bureau have been about such attainment.
One grows a little impatient sometimes when a high official at
Washington writes in response to a request for permission to use a
school building _after_ school hours, for a class of instruction in the
native Bible, that the law requires that all instruction in the school
be in the English language, and that it is against the policy of
Congress to use public money for religious instruction! When the
thermometer drops to 50° below zero and stays there for a couple of
weeks, it is an expensive matter to heat a church for a Bible class
three times a week--and the schoolhouse is already cosy and warm.

But the question does not reduce itself to the bald terms referred to
above; by proper advantage of times and seasons the Indian boy may have
all the English education that will be of any service to him, and may
yet serve his apprenticeship in the indispensable wilderness arts. And,
given a kindly and competent teacher, there is no need of any sort of
compulsion to bring Indian boys and girls to school when they are within
reach of it.

The Indian school problem is not an easy one in the sense that it can be
solved by issuing rules and regulations at Washington, but it can be
solved by sympathetic study and by the careful selection of intelligent,
cultured teachers.

After all, this last is the most important requisite. Too often it is
assumed that any one can teach ignorant youth: and women with no culture
at all, or with none beyond the bald "pedagogy" of a low-grade
schoolroom, have been sent to Alaska. There have, indeed, been notable
exceptions; there have been some very valuable and capable teachers, and
with such there has never been friction at the missions, but glad
co-operation.

The situation shows signs of improvement; there are signs of withdrawal
from its detached and supercilious attitude on the part of the bureau,
signs which are very welcome to those connected with the missions. For
the best interest of the native demands that the two agencies at work
for his good work heartily and sympathetically together. The missions
can do without the government--did do without it for many years, though
glad of the government's aid in carrying the burden of the schools--but
the government cannot do without the missions; and if the missions were
forced to the re-establishment of their own schools, there would be
empty benches in the schools of the government.

[Sidenote: THE THREAT OF EXTINCTION]

That the Indian race of interior Alaska is threatened with extinction,
there is unhappily little room to doubt; and that the threat may be
averted is the hope and labour of the missionaries amongst them. At most
places where vital statistics are kept the death-rate exceeds the
birth-rate, though it is sometimes very difficult to secure accurate
statistics and to be sure that they always cover the same ground. The
natives wander; within certain territorial limits they wander widely.
Whenever a child is born it is certain that if it lives long enough it
will be brought to a mission to be baptized, but a death often occurs at
some isolated camp that is not reported till long after, and may escape
registration altogether.

Certain diseases that have played havoc in the past are not much feared
now. For the last seven years supplies of the diphtheritic antitoxin
have been kept at all the missions of the Episcopal Church, and in the
summer of 1911, when there was an outbreak of smallpox at Porcupine
River, almost every Indian of interior Alaska was vaccinated, mainly by
the mission staffs. Diphtheria has been a dreadful scourge. The valley
of the upper Kuskokwim was almost depopulated by it in 1906. A disease
resembling measles took half the population of the lower Yukon villages
in 1900. In the last few years there have been no serious epidemics; but
epidemic disease does not constitute the chief danger that threatens the
native.

[Sidenote: DWELLING AND CLOTHING]

That chief danger looms from two things: tuberculosis and whisky.
Whether tuberculosis is a disease indigenous to these parts, or whether
it was introduced with the white man, has been disputed and would be
difficult of determination. Probably it was always present amongst the
natives; the old ones declare that it was; but the changed conditions of
their lives have certainly much aggravated it. They lived much more in
the open when they had no tree-felling tool but a stone-axe and did not
build cabins. The winter residence in those days was, it is true, a
dark, half-underground hut covered with earth and poles, but the time of
residence therein was much shorter; the skin tent sheltered them most of
the year. Indeed, some tribes, such as the Chandalar, lived in their
skin tents the year round. Now an ill-ventilated and very commonly
overcrowded cabin shelters them most of the year. It is true that the
cabins are constantly improving and the standard of living within them
is constantly rising. The process is slow, despite all urgings and
warnings, and overcrowding and lack of ventilation still prevail.

[Illustration: THE NATIVE COMMUNICANT.]

[Illustration: RAW MATERIAL.]

Perhaps as great a cause of the spread of tuberculosis is the change in
clothing. The original native was clad in skins, which are the warmest
clothing in the world. Moose hide or caribou hide garments, tanned and
smoked, are impervious to the wind, and a parkee of muskrat or squirrel,
or, as was not uncommon in the old days, of marten, or one of caribou
tanned with the hair on, with boots of this last material, give all the
warmth that exposure to the coldest weather requires. Nowadays fur
garments of any sort are not usual amongst the natives. There is a
market, at an ever-growing price, for all the furs they can procure. A
law has, indeed, gone recently into effect prohibiting the sale of
beaver for a term of years, and already beaver coats and caps begin to
appear again amongst the people. It would be an excellent, wise thing,
worthy of a government that takes a fatherly interest in very childlike
folks, to make this law permanent. If it were fit to prohibit the
sale of beaver pelts for a term of years to protect the beaver, surely
it would be proper to perpetuate the enactment to protect the Indian. It
would mean warm clothing for man, woman, and child.

[Illustration: AN ESQUIMAU YOUTH.]

[Illustration: A HALF-BREED INDIAN.]

[Sidenote: THE INDIAN TRADER]

The Indian usually sells all his furs and then turns round and buys
manufactured clothing from the trader at a fancy price. That clothing is
almost always cotton and shoddy. Genuine woollens are not to be found in
the Indian trader's stock at all, and in whatever guise it may
masquerade, and by whatever alias it may pass, the native wear is
cotton. Yet there is no country in the world where it is more
imperative, for the preservation of health, that wool be worn.

However much fur the Indian may catch and sell, he is always poor. He is
paid in trade, not in cash; and when the merchant has bought the
Indian's catch of fur he straightway spreads out before him an alluring
display of goods specially manufactured for native trade. Here are
brilliant cotton velvets and sateens and tinselled muslins and gay
ribbons that take the eye of his women folk; here are trays of Brummagem
knickknacks, brass watches, and rings set with coloured glass, gorgeous
celluloid hair combs, mirrors with elaborate, gilded frames, and brass
lamps with "hand-painted" shades and dangling lustres; here are German
accordions and mouth-organs and all sorts of pocket-knives and
alarm-clocks--the greatest collection of glittering and noisy trash that
can be imagined, bought at so much a dozen and retailed, usually, at
about the same price for one. And when the Indian has done his trading
the trader has most of his money back again.

The news that an Indian has caught a black fox, the most exciting item
of news that ever flies around a native village, does not give any great
pleasure to one who is acquainted with native conditions, because he
knows that it will bring little real benefit to the Indian. There will
be keen competition, within limits, of course, amongst the traders for
it; and the fortunate trapper may get three or four hundred dollars in
trade for a skin that will fetch eight hundred or a thousand in cash on
the London market; but if his wife get the solid advantage of a new
cooking-stove or a sewing-machine from it she is doing well.

Food the Indian never buys much beyond his present need, unless it is to
squander it in feast after feast, to which every one is invited and at
which there is the greatest lavishness. If a son is born, or a black fox
is caught, or a member of the family recovers from a severe illness,
custom permits, if it do not actually demand, that a "potlatch" be
given, and most Indians are eager, whenever they are able, to be the
heroes of the prandial hour.

So he, his women, and his children go clad mainly in cotton, and there
is abundant evidence that the tendency to pulmonary trouble, always
latent amongst them, is developed by the severe colds which they catch
through the inadequate covering of their bodies, and is then cherished
into virulent activity by the close atmosphere of overcrowded,
overheated cabins.

The missions help the Indians, especially the women and children, in
this matter of clothing as much as possible. Every year large bales of
good though left-off under and over wear are secured through church
organisations outside, and are traded to the natives at nominal prices,
usually for fish or game or a little labour in sawing wood. And this
naturally does not ingratiate missions with the trading class. One's
anger is aroused sometimes at seeing the cotton-flannel underclothes and
"cotton-filled" blankets and the "all-wool" cotton coats and trousers
which they pay high prices for at the stores. The Canadian Indians, who
are their neighbours, buy genuine Hudson Bay blankets and other real
woollen goods, but the Alaskan Indian can buy nothing but cotton.

But far and away beyond any other cause of the native decline stands the
curse of the country, whisky. Recognising by its long Indian experience
the consequences of forming liquor-drinking habits amongst the natives,
the government has forbidden under penalty the giving or selling of any
intoxicants to them. A few years ago a new law passed making such giving
or selling a felony. These laws are largely a dead letter.

[Sidenote: UNPAID COMMISSIONERS]

The country is a very large one, very sparsely populated; the distances
are enormous, the means of transportation entirely primitive, and the
police and legal machinery insufficient to the end of suppressing this
illicit traffic, especially in view of the fact that a considerable part
of the whole population does not look with favour upon any vigorous
attempt to suppress it. Great areas of the country are without
telegraphic communication, and in parts mail is received only once a
month. One stretch of two hundred and fifty miles of the Yukon receives
no mail at all during the winter months--more than half the year. In
that instance, as in many others, the country has gone distinctly
backward in the past few years. The magistrates--"commissioners" they
are called, receive no salary, but eke out a precarious and often
wretched existence on fees, so that it is frequently impossible to get
men of character and capacity to accept such offices.

One would have supposed that amongst all the legislating that has been
done for and about Alaska in the last year or two, one crying evil that
the attention of successive administrations has been called to for
twenty years past would have been remedied. That evil is the unpaid
magistrate and the vicious fee system by which he must make a living. It
is a system that has been abolished in nearly all civilised countries; a
system that lends itself to all sorts of petty abuse; a system that no
one pretends to defend. No greater single step in advance could be made
in the government of Alaska, no measure could be enacted that would tend
to bring about in greater degree respect for the law than the abolition
of the unpaid magistracy and the setting up of a body of stipendiaries
of character and ability.

The anomalies of the present situation are in some cases amusing. At one
place on the Yukon it is only possible for a man to make a living as
United States commissioner if he can combine the office of postmaster
with it. A man who was removed as commissioner still retained the
post-office, and no one could be found to accept the vacant judgeship.
In another precinct the commissioner was moving all those whom he
thought had influence to get him appointed deputy marshal instead of
commissioner, because the deputy marshal gets a salary of two thousand
dollars a year and allowances, which was more than the commissionership
yielded. One is reminded of some comic-opera topsyturvyism when the
judge tries in vain to get off the bench and be appointed constable. It
sounds like the _Bab Ballads_. The district court is compelled to wink
at irregularities of life and conduct in its commissioners because it
cannot get men of a higher stamp to accept its appointments.

[Sidenote: LIQUOR AND POLITICS]

The only policemen are deputy United States marshals, primarily
process-servers and not at all fitted in the majority of cases for any
sort of detective work. Their appointment is often dictated and their
action often hampered by political considerations. The liquor interest
is very strong and knows how to bring pressure to bear against a marshal
who is offensively active. They are responsible only to the United
States marshal of their district, and he is responsible to the
attorney-general, the head of the department of justice. But Washington
is a long way off, and the attorney-general is a very busy man, not
without his own interest, moreover, in politics. An attempt to get some
notice taken of a particular case in which it was the general opinion
that an energetic and vigilant deputy had been removed, and an elderly
lethargic man substituted, because of too great activity in the
prosecution of liquor cases, resulted in the conviction that what
should have been a matter of administrative righteousness only was a
political matter as well.

The threatened extinction of the Alaskan native was referred to as
wanton, and the term was used in the sense that there are no necessary
natural causes fighting against his survival.

Here is no economic pressure of white settlers determined to occupy the
land, such as drove the Indians of the plains farther and farther west
until there was no more west to be driven to. If such delusion possess
any mind as a result of foolish newspaper and magazine writings, let it
be dismissed at once. No man who has lived in the country and travelled
in the country will countenance such notion. The white men in Alaska are
miners and prospectors, trappers and traders, wood-choppers and
steamboat men. Around a mining camp will be found a few truck-farmers;
alongside road-houses and wood camps will often be found flourishing
vegetable gardens, but outside of such agriculture there are, speaking
broadly, no farmers at all in the interior of Alaska. Probably a
majority of all the homesteads that have been taken up have been located
that the trees on them might be cut down and hauled to town to be sold
for fire-wood. A few miles away from the towns there are no homesteads,
except perhaps on a well-travelled trail where a man has homesteaded a
road-house.

AFTER A NEW LIGHT SNOWFALL.]

All the settlements in the country are on the rivers, save the purely
mining settlements that die and are abandoned as the placers play out.
Yet one will travel two hundred and fifty miles up the Porcupine--till
Canada is reached--and pass not more than three white men's cabins, all
of them trappers; one will travel three hundred and fifty miles up the
Koyukuk before the first white man's cabin is reached, and as many miles
up the Innoko and the Iditarod and find no white men save wood-choppers.
There are a few more white men on the Tanana than on any other tributary
of the Yukon, because Fairbanks is on that river and there is more
steamboat traffic, but they are mainly wood-choppers, while on the
lesser tributaries of the Yukon, it is safe to say, there are no settled
white men at all. As soon as one leaves the rivers and starts across
country one is in the uninhabited wilderness.

The writer is no prophet; he cannot tell what may happen agriculturally
in Alaska or the rest of the arctic regions when the world outside is
filled up and all unfrozen lands are under cultivation. Still less is he
one who would belittle a country he has learned to love or detract in
any way from its due claims to the attention of mankind. There is in the
territory a false newspaper sentiment that every one who lives in the
land should be continually singing extravagant praises of it and
continually making extravagant claims for it. A man may love Alaska
because he believes it to have "vast agricultural possibilities,"
because, in his visions, he sees its barren wilds transformed into
"waving fields of golden grain." But a man may also love it who regards
all such visions as delusions.

[Sidenote: FOOD AND FURS]

The game and the fish of Alaska, the natural subsistence of the Indian,
are virtually undiminished. Vast herds of caribou still wander on the
hills, and far more are killed every year by wolves than by men. Great
numbers of moose still roam the lowlands. The rivers still teem with
salmon and grayling and the lakes with whitefish, ling, and lush. Unless
the outrage of canneries should be permitted at the mouths of the
Yukon--and that would threaten the chief subsistence of all the Indians
of the interior--there seems no danger of permanent failure of the
salmon run, though, of course, it varies greatly from year to year.
Furs, though they diminish in number, continually rise in price. There
are localities, it is true, where the game has been largely killed off
and the furs trapped out; the Koyukuk country is one of them, though
perhaps that region never was a very good game country. In this region,
when a few years ago there was a partial failure of the salmon, there
was distress amongst the Indians. But the country on the whole is almost
as good an Indian country as ever it was, and there are few signs that
it tends otherwise, though things happen so quickly and changes come
with so little warning in Alaska that one does not like to be too
confident.

The Indian is the only settled inhabitant of interior Alaska to-day; for
the prospectors and miners, who constitute the bulk of the white
population, are not often very long in one place. Many of them might
rightly be classed as permanent, but very few as settled inhabitants. It
is the commonest thing to meet men a thousand miles away from the place
where one met them last. A new "strike" will draw men from every mining
camp in Alaska. A big strike will shift the centre of gravity of the
whole white population in a few months. Indeed, a certain restless
belief in the superior opportunities of some other spot is one of the
characteristics of the prospector. The tide of white men that has flowed
into an Indian neighbourhood gradually ebbs away and leaves the Indian
behind with new habits, with new desires, with new diseases, with new
vices, and with a varied assortment of illegitimate half-breed children
to support. The Indian remains, usually in diminished numbers, with
impaired character, with lowered physique, with the tag-ends of the
white man's blackguardism as his chief acquirement in English--but he
remains.

It is unquestionable that the best natives in the country are those that
have had the least intimacy with the white man, and it follows that the
most hopeful and promising mission stations are those far up the
tributary streams, away from mining camps and off the routes of travel,
difficult of access, winter or summer, never seen by tourists at all;
seen only of those who seek them with cost and trouble. At such stations
the improvement of the Indian is manifest and the population increases.
By reason of their remoteness they are very expensive to equip and
maintain, but they are well worth while. One such has been described on
the Koyukuk; another, at this writing, is establishing with equal
promise at the Tanana Crossing, one of the most difficult points to
reach in all interior Alaska.

This chapter must not close without a few words about the native
children. Dirty, of course, they almost always are; children in a state
of nature will always be dirty, and even those farthest removed from
that state show a marked tendency to revert to it; but when one has
become sufficiently used to their dirt to be able to ignore it, they are
very attractive. Intolerance of dirt is largely an acquired habit
anyway. In view of their indulgent rearing, for Indian parents are
perhaps the most indulgent in the world, they are singularly docile;
they have an affectionate disposition and are quick and eager to learn.
Many of them are very pretty, with a soft beauty of complexion and a
delicate moulding of feature that are lost as they grow older. It takes
some time to overcome their shyness and win their confidence, but when
friendly relations have been established one grows very fond of them.
Foregathering with them again is distinctly something to look forward to
upon the return to a mission, and to see them come running, to have them
press around, thrusting their little hands into one's own or hanging to
one's coat, is a delight that compensates for much disappointment with
the grown ups. In the midst of such a crowd of healthy, vivacious
youngsters, clear-eyed, clean-limbed, and eager, one positively refuses
to be hopeless about the race.




CHAPTER XII

PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE ARCTIC


THERE is no country in which an anastigmatic lens is of more use to the
photographer than Alaska, and every camera with which it is hoped to
take winter scenes should have this equipment. During two or three
months in the year it makes the difference in practice between getting
photographs and getting none. In theory one may always set up a tripod
and increase length of exposure as light diminishes. But the most
interesting scenes, the most attractive effects often present themselves
under the severest conditions of weather, and he must be an enthusiast,
indeed, who will get his tripod from the sled, pull out its telescoped
tubes, set it up and adjust it for a picture with the thermometer at 40°
or 50° below zero; and when he is done he is very likely to be a frozen
enthusiast.

With an anastigmatic lens working at, say f. 6-3, and with a "speed"
film (glass plates are utterly out of the question on the trail), it is
possible to make a snap-shot at one twenty-fifth of a second on a clear
day, around noon, even in the dead of winter, in any part of Alaska that
the writer has travelled in. There are those who write that they can
always hold a camera still enough to get a sharp negative at even one
tenth of a second. Probably the personal equation counts largely in
such a matter, and a man of very decided phlegmatic temperament may have
advantage over his more sanguine and nervous brother. The thing may be
done; the writer has done it himself; but the point is it cannot be
depended on; at this speed three out of four of his exposures will be
blurred, whereas at one twenty-fifth of a second a sharp, clear negative
may always be secured.

It may be admitted at once that at extremely low temperatures the
working of any shutter becomes doubtful, and most of them go out of any
reliable action altogether. After trying and failing completely with
three or four of the more expensive makes of shutters, the writer has
for the last few years used a "Volute" with general satisfaction, though
in the great cold even that shutter (from which all trace of grease or
oil was carefully removed by the makers) is somewhat slowed up, so that
a rare exposure at 50° or 60° below zero would be made at an indicated
speed of one fiftieth rather than at one twenty-fifth, taking the chance
of an under-exposed rather than a blurred negative. To wish for a
shutter of absolute correctness and of absolute dependability under all
circumstances, arranged for exposures of one fifteenth and one twentieth
as well as one tenth and one twenty-fifth, is probably to wish for the
unobtainable.

[Sidenote: CARE OF FILMS AND CAMERAS]

The care of the camera and the films, exposed and unexposed, the winter
through, when travelling on the Alaskan trail, is a very important and
very simple matter, though not generally learned until many negatives
have been spoiled and sometimes lenses injured. It may be summed up in
one general rule--keep instrument and films always outdoors.

One unfamiliar with arctic conditions would not suppose that much
trouble would be caused by that arch-enemy of all photographic
preparations and apparatus--damp, in a country where the thermometer
rarely goes above freezing the winter through; and that is a just
conclusion provided such things be kept in the natural temperature,
outdoors. But consider the great range of temperature when the
thermometer stands at -50° outdoors, and, say, 75° indoors. Here is a
difference of 125°. Anything wooden or metallic, especially anything
metallic, brought into the house immediately condenses the moisture with
which the warm interior atmosphere is laden and becomes in a few moments
covered with frost. Gradually, as the article assumes the temperature of
the room, the frost melts, the water is absorbed, and the damage is done
as surely as though it had been soused in a bucket. If it be necessary
to take camera and films indoors for an interior view--which one does
somewhat reluctantly--the films must be taken at once to the stove and
the camera only very gradually; leaving the latter on the floor, the
coldest part of the room, for a while and shifting its position nearer
and nearer until the frost it has accumulated begins to melt, whereupon
it should be placed close to the heat that the water may evaporate as
fast as it forms.

Outdoors, camera and films alike are perfectly safe, however intense the
cold. Indeed, films keep almost indefinitely in the cold and do not
deteriorate at all. One learns, by and by, to have all films sent
sealed up in tin cans, _and to put them back and seal them up again when
exposed_, despite the maker's instructions not to do so. The maker knows
the rules, but the user learns the exceptions. When films are thus
protected they may be taken indoors or left out indifferently, as no
moist air can get to them.

The rule given is one that all men in this country follow with firearms.
They are always left outdoors, and no iron will rust outdoors in the
winter. Unless a man intend to take his gun to pieces and clean it
thoroughly, he never brings it in the house. The writer has on several
occasions removed an exposed film and inserted a new one outdoors, using
the loaded sled for a table, at 50° below zero; taking the chance of
freezing his fingers rather than of ruining the film. It is an
interesting exercise in dexterity of manipulation. Everything that can
be done with the mittened hand is done, the material is placed within
easy reach--then off with the mittens and gloves, and make the change as
quickly as may be!

There is just one brief season in the year when high speeds of shutters
may be used: in the month of April, when a new flurry of snow has put a
mantle of dazzling whiteness upon the earth and the sun mounts
comparatively high in the heavens. Under such circumstances there is
almost, if not quite, tropical illumination. Here is a picture of native
football at the Allakaket, just north of the Arctic Circle, made late in
April with a Graflex, fitted with a lens working at f. 4.5, at the full
speed of its focal-plane shutter--one one-thousandth of a second. In
five years' use that was the only time when that speed was used, or any
speed above one two-hundred-and-fiftieth. Commonly, even in summer, many
more exposures are made with it at one fiftieth than at one
one-hundredth, for this is not a brightly lit country in summer, and
nearly all visitors and tourists find their negatives much under-timed.

The Graflex, though unapproached in its own sphere, is not a good
all-round camera, despite confident assertions to the contrary. It is
too bulky to carry at all in the winter, and its mechanism is apt to
refuse duty in the cold. The 3A Graflex cannot be turned to make a
perpendicular photograph, but must always be used with the greatest
dimension horizontal. Except in brilliant sunshine it is difficult to
get a sharp focus, and, even though the focus appear sharp on the ground
glass, the negative may prove blurred. Then the instrument is a great
dust catcher and seems to have been constructed with a perverse
ingenuity so as to make it as difficult as possible to clean.

The writer uses his Graflex almost solely for native portraits and
studies, for which purpose it is admirable, and has enabled him to
secure negatives that he could not have obtained with any other hand
camera. Even in the summer, however, he always carries his 3A Folding
Pocket Kodak as well, and uses it instead of the Graflex for landscapes
and large groups. If he had to choose between the two instruments and
confine himself to one, he would unhesitatingly choose the Folding
Pocket Kodak.

The difficulties of winter photography in Alaska do not end with the
making of the exposure. All water must be brought up in a bucket from a
water-hole in the river, and though it be clear water when it is dipped
up from under the ice, it is chiefly ice by the time it reaches the
house, during any cold spell. One learns to be very economical of water
when it is procured with such difficulty, learns to dry prints with
blotting-paper between the successive washings, which is the best way of
washing with the minimum of water. Blotting-paper is decidedly cheaper
than water under some circumstances.

While the rivers run perfectly clear and bright under the ice in the
winter, in summer the turbid water of nearly all our large streams
introduces another difficulty, and photographic operation must sometimes
be deferred for weeks, unless the rain barrels be full or enough ice be
found in the ice-house, over and above the domestic needs, to serve.

[Sidenote: EFFECT OF COLD ON EMULSIONS]

It seems certain that the speed of the sensitive emulsions with which
the films are covered is reduced in very cold weather. To determine
whether or not this was so, the following experiments were resorted to.
The camera was brought out of the house half an hour before noon, at 50°
below zero, and an exposure made immediately. Then the camera was left
in position for an hour and another exposure made. There was little
difference in the strength of the negatives, and what difference there
was seemed in favour of the second exposure. Evidently, if the emulsion
had slowed, the shutter had slowed also; so opportunity was awaited to
make a more decisive test. When there remained but one exposure on a
roll of film, the camera was set outdoors at a temperature of 55° below
zero and left for an hour. Then an exposure was made and the film wound
up and withdrawn; while a new film, just brought from the house, was as
quickly as possible inserted in its place and a second exposure made.
The latter was appreciably stronger. Even this test is, of course, not
entirely conclusive; one would have to be quite sure that the emulsions
were identical; but it confirms the writer's impression that extreme
cold slows the film. It would be an easy matter for the manufacturers to
settle this point beyond question in a modern laboratory, and it is
certainly worth doing.

There is much sameness about winter scenes in Alaska, as the reader has
doubtless already remarked; yet the sameness is more due to a lack of
alertness in the photographer than to an absence of variety. If the
traveller had nothing to think about but his camera, if all other
considerations could be subordinated to the securing of negatives, then,
here as elsewhere, the average merit of pictures would be greater.
Sometimes the most interesting scenes occur in the midst of stress of
difficult travel when there is opportunity for no more than a fleeting
recognition of their pictorial interest. "Tight places" often make
attractive pictures, but most commonly do not get made into pictures at
all. The study of the aspects of nature is likely to languish amidst the
severe weather of the Northern winter, and the bright, clear, mild day
gets photographed into undue prominence. Snow is more or less white and
spruce-trees in the mass are more or less black; one dog team is very
like another; a native village has to be known very well, indeed, to be
distinguishable from another native village. Yet there is individuality,
there is distinction, there is variety, there is contrast, if a man have
but the grace to recognise them and the zeal to record them. Snow itself
has infinite variety; trees, all of them, have characters of their own.
Dogs differ as widely as men and Indians as widely as white men.

[Sidenote: INDIANS AND PHOTOGRAPHS]

The fear of the camera, or the dislike of the camera, that used to
affect the native mind is gone now, save, perhaps, in certain remote
quarters, and these interesting people are generally quite willing to
stand still and be snapped. They ask for a print, and upon one's next
visit there is clamorous demand for "picter, picter." A famous French
physician said that his dread of the world to come lay in his
expectation that the souls he met would reproach him for not having
cured a certain obstinate malady that he had much repute in dealing
with; so the travelling amateur in photography sometimes feels his
conscience heavy under a load of promised pictures that he has forgotten
or has been unable to make. He feels that his native friends whom he
shall meet in the world to come will assuredly greet him with "where's
my picture?" The burden increases all the time, and the Indian never
forgets. It avails nothing even to explain that the exposure was a
failure. A picture was promised; no picture has been given; that is as
far as the native gets. And the making of extra prints, in the cases
where it is possible to make them, is itself quite a tax upon time and
material.

Just as it is true that to be well informed on any subject a man must
read a great deal and be content not to have use for a great deal that
he reads, so to secure good photographs of spots and scenes of note as
he travels, he must make many negatives and be content to destroy many.
The records of a second visit in better weather or at a more favourable
season will supersede an earlier; typical groups more casual ones. The
standard that he exacts of himself rises and work he was content with
contents him no more. Sometimes one is tempted to think that the main
difference between an unsuccessful and a successful amateur photographer
is that the former hoards all his negatives while the latter
relentlessly burns those which do not come up to the mark--if not at
once, yet assuredly by and by. So the surprise that one feels at many of
the illustrations in modern books of arctic travel is not that the
travellers made such poor photographs but that they kept them and used
them; for there can be no question that poor photographs are worse than
none at all.




CHAPTER XIII

THE NORTHERN LIGHTS


THE Northern Lights are a very common phenomenon of interior Alaska,
much more common than in the very high latitudes around the North Pole,
for it has been pretty well determined that there is an auroral pole,
just as there is a magnetic pole and a pole of cold, none of which
coincides with the geographical Pole itself. All the arctic explorers
seem agreed that north of the 80th parallel these appearances are less
in frequency and brilliance than in the regions ten or fifteen degrees
farther south. It may be said roundly that it is a rare thing in winter
for a still, clear night, when there is not much moon, to pass without
some auroral display in the interior of Alaska. As long as we have any
night at all in the early summer, and as soon as we begin to have night
again late in the summer, they may be seen; so that one gains the
impression that the phenomenon occurs the year round and is merely
rendered invisible by the perpetual daylight of midsummer.

[Sidenote: A GENERAL AURORA]

The Alaskan auroras seem to divide themselves into two great classes,
those that occupy the whole heavens on a grand scale and appear to be at
a great distance above the earth, and those that are smaller and seem
much closer. Inasmuch as a letter written from Fort Yukon to a town in
Massachusetts describing one of the former class brought a reply that on
the same night a brilliant aurora was observed there also, it would seem
that auroras on the grand scale are visible over a large part of the
earth's surface at once, whereas the lesser manifestations, though
sometimes of great brilliance and beauty, give one the impression of
being local.

One gets, unfortunately, so accustomed to this light in the sky in
Alaska that it becomes a matter of course and is little noticed unless
it be extraordinarily vivid. Again, often very splendid displays occur
in the intensely cold weather, when, no matter how warmly one may be
clad, it is impossible to stand still long outdoors, and outdoors an
observer must be to follow the constant movement that accompanies the
aurora. Moreover, there is something very tantalising in the observing,
for it is impossible to say at what moment an ordinary waving auroral
streamer that stretches its greenish milky light across the sky,
beautiful yet commonplace, may burst forth into a display of the first
magnitude, or if it will do so at all.

The winter traveller has the best chance for observing this phenomenon,
because much of his travel is done before daylight, and often much more
than he desires or deserves is done after daylight; while, if his
journeys be protracted so long as snow and ice serve for passage at all,
towards spring he will travel entirely at night instead of by day.

It is intended in this chapter merely to attempt a description of a few
of the more striking auroral displays that the writer has seen, the
accounts being transcribed from journals written within a few hours, at
most, from the time of occurrence, and in the first case written so soon
as he went indoors.

This was on the 6th of October, 1904, at Fairbanks, a little removed
from the town itself. When first the heavens were noticed there was one
clear bow of milky light stretching from the northern to the southern
horizon, reflected in the broken surface of the river, and glistening on
the ice cakes that swirled down with the swift current. Then the
southern end of the bow began to twist on itself until it had produced a
queer elongated corkscrew appearance half-way up to the zenith, while
the northern end spread out and bellied from east to west. Then the
whole display moved rapidly across the sky until it lay low and faint on
the western horizon, and it seemed to be all over. But before one could
turn to go indoors a new point of light appeared suddenly high up in the
sky and burst like a pyrotechnic bomb into a thousand pear-shaped
globules with a molten centre flung far out to north and south. Then
began one of the most beautiful celestial exhibitions that the writer
has ever seen. These globules stretched into ribbon streamers, dividing
and subdividing until the whole sky was filled with them, and these
ribbon streamers of greenish opalescent light curved constantly inward
and outward upon themselves, with a quick jerking movement like the
cracking of a whip, and every time the ribbons curved, their lower edges
frayed out, and the fringe was prismatic. The pinks and mauves flashed
as the ribbon curved and frayed--and were gone. There was no other
colour in the whole heavens save the milky greenish-white light, but
every time the streamers thrashed back and forth their under edges
fringed into the glowing tints of mother-of-pearl. Presently, the whole
display faded out until it was gone. But, as we turned again to seek the
warmth of the house, all at once tiny fingers of light appeared all over
the upper sky, like the flashing of spicules of alum under a microscope
when a solution has dried to the point of crystallisation, and stretched
up and down, lengthening and lengthening to the horizon, and gathering
themselves together at the zenith into a crown. Three times this was
repeated; each time the light faded gradually but completely from the
sky and flashed out again instantaneously.

For a full hour, until it was impossible to stand gazing any longer for
the cold, the fascinating display was watched, and how much longer it
continued cannot be said. It was a grand general aurora, high in the
heavens, not vividly coloured save for the prismatic fringes, but of
brilliant illumination, and remarkable amongst all the auroras observed
since for its sudden changes and startling climaxes. Draped auroras are
common in this country, though it has been wrongly stated that they are
only seen near open seas, but their undulations are generally more
deliberate and their character maintained; this one flashed on and off
and changed its nature as though some finger were pressing buttons that
controlled the electrical discharges of the universe. Yet it was noticed
that even in its brightest moments the light of the stars could be seen
through it.

[Sidenote: A LOCAL AURORA]

The next aurora to be described was of a totally different kind. It
occurred on the 18th of March, 1905. The writer, with an Indian
attendant, was travelling on the Koyukuk River from Coldfoot to Bettles,
and, owing to a heavy, drifted trail, night had fallen while yet the
road-house was far away. There was no moon and the wind-swept trail was
wholly indistinguishable from the surrounding snow, yet to keep on the
trail was the only chance of going forward at all, for whenever the
toboggan slid off into the deep, soft snow it came to a standstill and
had to be dragged laboriously back again. A good leader would have kept
the trail, but we had none such amongst our dogs that year. Thus,
slowly, we went along in the dark, continually missing the trail on this
side and on that. We did not know on which bank of the river the
road-house was situated, for it was our first journey in those parts. We
only knew the trail would take us there could we follow it. All at once
a light burst forth, seemingly not a hundred yards above our heads, that
lit up that trail like a search-light and threw our shadows black upon
the snow. There was nothing faint and fluorescent about that aurora; it
burned and gleamed like magnesium wire. And by its light we were able to
see our path distinctly and to make good time along it, until in a mile
or two we were gladdened by the sight of the candle shining in the
window of the road-house and were safe for the night.

Now, one does not really know that this was an aurora at all, save that
there was nothing else it could have been. It was a phenomenon
altogether apart from the one first described; not occupying the vault
of heaven, streaming from horizon to zenith; not remote and majestic.
There was really little opportunity to observe it at all; one's eyes
were fixed upon the trail it illumined, anxious not to set foot to the
right or left. Save for an occasional glance upward, we saw only its
reflected light upon the white expanse beneath. It was simply a streak
of light right above our heads, holding steadily in position, though
fluctuating a little in strength--a light to light us home, that is what
it was to us. And it was the most surprising and opportune example of
what has been referred to here as the _local_ aurora that eight winters
have afforded. The most opportune but not the most beautiful; the next
to be described, though of the local order, was the most striking and
beautiful manifestation of the Northern Lights the writer has ever seen.
It was that rare and lovely thing--a coloured aurora--all of one rich
deep tint.

[Sidenote: A RED AURORA]

It was on the 11th of March, 1907, on the Chandalar River, a day's march
above the gap by which that stream enters the Yukon Flats and five days
north of Fort Yukon. A new "strike" had been made on the Chandalar, and
a new town, "Caro," established;--abandoned since. All day long we had
been troubled and hindered by overflow water on the ice, saturating the
snow, an unpleasant feature for which this stream is noted; and when
night fell and we thought we ought to be approaching the town, it seemed
yet unaccountably far off. At last, in the darkness, we came to a creek
that we decided must surely be Flat Creek, near the mouth of which the
new settlement stood; and at the same time we came to overflow water so
deep that it covered both ice and snow and looked dangerous. So the dogs
were halted while the Indian boy went ahead cautiously to see if the
town were not just around the bend, and the writer sat down, tired, on
the sled. While sitting there, all at once, from the top of the
mountainous bluff that marked the mouth of the creek, a clear red light
sprang up and spread out across the sky, dyeing the snow and gleaming in
the water, lighting up all the river valley from mountain to mountain
with a most beautiful carmine of the utmost intensity and depth. In wave
after wave it came, growing brighter and brighter, as though some
gigantic hand on that mountain top were flinging out the liquid radiance
into the night. There was no suggestion of any other colour, it was all
pure carmine, and it seemed to accumulate in mid-air until all the
landscape was bathed in its effulgence. And then it gradually died away.
The native boy was gone just half an hour. It began about five minutes
after he left and ended about five minutes before he returned, so that
its whole duration was twenty minutes. There had been no aurora at all
before; there was nothing after, for his quest had been fruitless, and,
since we would not venture that water in the dark, we made our camp on
the bank and were thus two hours or more yet in the open. The boy had
stopped to look at it himself, "long time," as he said, and declared it
was the only red aurora he had ever seen in his twenty odd years' life.
It was a very rare and beautiful sight, and it was hard to resist that
impression of a gigantic hand flinging liquid red fire from the mountain
top into the sky. Its source seemed no higher than the mountain
top--seemed to be the mountain top itself--and its extent seemed
confined within the river valley.

[Sidenote: A GRAND GENERAL DISPLAY]

There is only one other that shall be described, although there are many
mentioned with more or less particularity in the diaries of these
travels. And this last one is of the character of the first and not at
all of the second and third, for it was on the grand scale, filling all
the heavens, a phenomenon, one is convinced, of an order distinct and
different from the local, near-at-hand kind. There was exceptionally
good opportunity for observing this display, since it occurred during an
all-night journey, the night of the 6th of April, 1912, with brilliant
starlight but no moon while we were hastening to reach Eagle for Easter.

We had made a new traverse from the Tanana to the Yukon, through two
hundred miles of uninhabited country, and had missed the head of the
creek that would have taken us to the latter river in thirty miles,
dropping into one that meandered for upward of a hundred before it
discharged into the great river. It was one o'clock on Good Friday
morning when we reached a road-house on the Yukon eighty miles from
Eagle. The only chance to keep the appointment was to travel all the two
remaining nights. So we cached almost all our load at the road-house,
for we should retrace our steps when Eagle was visited, and thus were
able to travel fast.

Both nights were marked by fine auroral displays, so extensive and of
such apparent height as to give the impression that they must be visible
over large areas of the earth. Both continued all night long and were
of the same general description, but the second night's display was
emphasised in its main features and elaborated in its detail, and was
the more striking and notable and worthy of description.

It began by an exquisite and delicate weaving of fine, fluorescent
filaments of light in and out among the stars, until at times a perfect
network was formed, like lace amidst diamonds, first in one quarter of
the heavens, then in another, then stretching and weaving its web right
across the sky. The Yukon runs roughly north and south in these reaches,
and the general trend of the whole display was parallel with the river's
course. For an hour or more the ceaseless extension and looping of these
infinitely elastic threads of light went on, with constant variation in
their brilliance but no change in their form and never an instant's
cessation of motion.

[Illustration: "MUK," A PURE MALAMUTE.]

Then the familiar feature of the draped aurora was introduced, always a
beautiful sight to watch. Slowly and most gracefully issued out of the
north band after band, band after band of pale-green fire, each curling
and recurling on itself like the ribbon that carries the motto under a
shield of arms, and each continually fraying out its lower edge into
subdued rainbow tints. Then these bands, never for a moment still, were
gathered up together to the zenith, till from almost all round the
horizon vibrant meridians of light stretched up to a crown of glory
almost but not quite directly overhead, so bright that all the waving
bands that now assumed more the appearance of its rays paled before it.
Then the crown began to revolve, and as it revolved with constantly
increasing speed, it gathered all its rays into one gigantic spiral that
travelled as it spun towards the east until all form was dissipated in a
nebulous mist that withdrew behind the mountains and glowered there like
a dawn and left the skies void of all light save the stars. It was a
fine instance of the stupendous sportiveness of the aurora that
sometimes seems to have no more law or rule than the gambolling of a
kitten, and to build up splendid and majestic effects merely to "whelm
them all in wantonness" a moment later. A particularly fine and striking
phase of an aurora is very likely to be followed by some such sudden
whimsical destruction. It was as though that light hidden behind the
mountains were mocking us.

Then from out the north again appeared one clear belt of light that
stretched rapidly and steadily all across the heavens until it formed an
arch that stood there stationary. And from that motionless arch, the
only motionless manifestation that whole night, there came a gradual
superb crescendo of light that lit the wide, white river basin from
mountain top to mountain top and threw the shadows of the dogs and the
sled sharper and blacker upon the snow,--and in the very moment of its
climax was gone again utterly while yet the exclamations of wonder were
on our lips. It was as though, piqued at our admiration, the aurora had
wiped itself out; and often and often there is precisely that impression
of wilfulness about it.

All night long the splendour kept up, and all night long, as the dogs
went at a good clip and one of us rode while the other was at the
sled's handle-bars, we gazed and marvelled at its infinite variety, at
its astonishing fertility of effect, at its whimsical vagaries, until
the true dawn of Easter swallowed up the beauty of the night as we came
in sight of Eagle. And we wondered with what more lavish advertisement
the dawn of the first Easter was heralded into the waste places of the
snow.

[Sidenote: SOUND AND SMELL]

There are men in Alaska, whose statements demand every respect, who
claim to have heard frequently and unmistakably a swishing sound
accompanying the movements of the aurora, and there are some who claim
to have detected an odour accompanying it. Without venturing any opinion
on the subject in general, the writer would simply say that, though he
thinks he possesses as good ears and as good a nose as most people, he
has never heard any sound or smelled any odour that he believed to come
from the Northern Lights. Indeed, he has often felt that with all the
light-producing energy and with all the rapid movement of the aurora it
was mysterious that there should be absolutely no sound. The aurora
often looks as if it _ought_ to swish, but to his ears it has never done
it; so much phosphorescent light might naturally be accompanied by some
chemical odour, but to his nostrils never has been.

Queer, uncertain noises in the silence of an arctic night there often
are--noises of crackling twigs, perhaps, noises of settling snow, noises
in the ice itself--but they are to be heard when there is no aurora as
well as when there is. It is rare to stand on the banks of the Yukon on
a cold night and not hear some faint crepitating sounds, sometimes
running back and forth across the frozen river, sometimes resembling the
ring of distant skates. Without offering any pronouncement upon what is
a very interesting question, it seems to the writer possible that, to an
ear intently listening, some such noise coinciding with a decided
movement of a great auroral streamer might seem to be caused by the
movement it happened to accompany.




CHAPTER XIV

THE ALASKAN DOGS


[Sidenote: MALAMUTE, HUSKY, AND SIWASH]

THERE are two breeds of native dogs in Alaska, and a third that is
usually spoken of as such. The malamute is the Esquimau dog; and what
for want of a better name is called the "Siwash" is the Indian dog. Many
years ago the Hudson Bay voyageurs bred some selected strains of
imported dog with the Indian dogs of those parts, or else did no more
than carefully select the best individuals of the native species and
bred from them exclusively--it is variously stated--and that is the
accepted origin of the "husky." The malamute and the husky are the two
chief sources of the white man's dog teams, though cross-breeding with
setters and pointers, hounds of various sorts, mastiffs, Saint Bernards,
and Newfoundlands has resulted in a general admixture of breeds, so that
the work dogs of Alaska are an heterogeneous lot to-day. It should also
be stated that the terms "malamute" and "husky" are very generally
confused and often used interchangeably.

The malamute, the Alaskan Esquimau dog, is precisely the same dog as
that found amongst the natives of Baffin's Bay and Greenland. Knud
Rasmunsen and Amundsen together have established the oneness of the
Esquimaux from the east coast of Greenland all round to Saint Michael;
they are one people, speaking virtually one language. And the malamute
dog is one dog. A photograph that Admiral Peary prints of one of the
Smith Sound dogs that pulled his sled to the North Pole would pass for a
photograph of one of the present writer's team, bred on the Koyukuk
River, the parents coming from Kotzebue Sound.

There was never animal better adapted to environment than the malamute
dog. His coat, while it is not fluffy, nor the hair long, is yet so
dense and heavy that it affords him a perfect protection against the
utmost severity of cold. His feet are tough and clean, and do not
readily accumulate snow between the toes and therefore do not easily get
sore--which is the great drawback of nearly all "outside" dogs and their
mixed progeny. He is hardy and thrifty and does well on less food than
the mixed breeds; and, despite Peary to the contrary, he will eat
anything. "He will not eat anything but meat," says Peary; "I have tried
and I know." No dog accustomed to a flesh diet willingly leaves it for
other food; the dog is a carnivorous animal. But hunger will whet his
appetite for anything that his bowels can digest. "Muk," the counterpart
of Peary's "King Malamute," has thriven for years on his daily ration of
dried fish, tallow, and rice, and eats biscuits and doughnuts whenever
he can get them. The malamute is affectionate and faithful and likes to
be made a pet of, but he is very jealous and an incorrigible fighter. He
has little of the fawning submissiveness of pet dogs "outside," but is
independent and self-willed and apt to make a troublesome pet. However,
pets that give little trouble seldom give much pleasure.

His comparative shortness of leg makes him somewhat better adapted to
the hard, crusted snow of the coast than to the soft snow of the
interior, but he is a ceaseless and tireless worker who loves to pull.
His prick ears, always erect, his bushy, graceful tail, carried high
unless it curl upon the back as is the case with some, his compact coat
of silver-grey, his sharp muzzle and black nose and quick narrow eyes
give him an air of keenness and alertness that marks him out amongst
dogs. When he is in good condition and his coat is taken care of he is a
handsome fellow, and he will weigh from seventy-five to eighty-five or
ninety pounds.

The husky is a long, rangy dog, with more body and longer legs than the
malamute and with a shorter coat. The coat is very thick and dense,
however, and furnishes a sufficient protection. A good, spirited husky
will carry his tail erect like a malamute, but the ears are not
permanently pricked up; they are mobile. He is, perhaps, the general
preference amongst dog drivers in the interior, but he has not the
graceful distinction of appearance of the malamute.

The "Siwash" dog is the common Indian dog; generally undersized, uncared
for, half starved most of the time, and snappish because not handled
save with roughness. In general appearance he resembles somewhat a small
malamute, though, indeed, nowadays so mixed have breeds become that he
may be any cur or mongrel. He is a wonderful little worker, and the
loads he will pull are astonishing. Sometimes, with it all, he is an
attractive-looking fellow, especially when there has been a good moose
or caribou killing and he has gorged upon the refuse and put some flesh
upon his bones. And if one will take a little trouble to make friends
with him he likes petting as much as any dog. Most Indian dogs "don't
sabe white man," and will snap at one's first advances. On the whole, it
is far better to let them alone; for, encouraged at all, they are
terrible thieves--what hungry creatures are not?--and make all sorts of
trouble with one's own team. The pure malamute and the pure husky do not
bark at all, they howl; barking is a sure sign of an admixture of other
strains.

[Sidenote: DOG BREEDING]

Here it may be worth while to say a few words about the general belief
that dogs in Alaska are interbred with wolves. That the dog and the wolf
have a common origin there can be no doubt, and that they will
interbreed is equally sure, but diligent inquiry on the part of the
writer for a number of years, throughout all interior Alaska, amongst
whites and natives, has failed to educe one authentic instance of
intentional interbreeding, has failed to discover one man who knows of
his own knowledge that any living dog is the offspring of such union.

While, therefore, it is not here stated that such cross-breeding has not
taken place, or even that it does not take place, yet the author is
satisfied that it is a very rare thing, indeed, and that the common
stories of dogs that are "half wolf" are fabulous.

Indeed, it seems a rare thing when any sort of pains is taken about the
breeding of dogs. In a country where dogs are so important, where they
are indispensable for any sort of travel during six or seven months in
the year over by far the greater portion of it, one would expect that
much attention would be paid to dog breeding; but this is not the case.
Here and there a man who takes pride in a team will carefully mate the
best available couple and carefully rear their offspring, but for the
most part breeding seems left to chance. A team all of malamutes or all
of huskies, a matched team of any sort, is the exception, and excites
interest and remark.

The market for dogs is so uncertain that it is doubtful if there would
be any money in scientific breeding for the trail. When a stampede to
new diggings takes place, the price of dogs rises enormously. Any sort
of good dog on the spot may be worth a hundred dollars, or a hundred and
fifty, and the man with a kennel would make a small fortune out of hand.
But at other times it is hard to get twenty-five dollars for the best of
dogs.

The cost of maintenance of a dog team is considerable. When the
mail-routes went all down the Yukon, and dogs were used exclusively, the
contracting company estimated that it cost seventy-five dollars per head
per annum to feed its dogs; while to the traveller in remote regions,
buying dog feed in small parcels here and there, the cost is not less
than one hundred dollars per head. Of course, a man engaged in dog
raising would have his own fish-wheel on the Yukon and would catch
almost all that his dogs would eat. Fish is plentiful in Alaska; it is
transportation that costs. Dogs not working can do very well on
straight dried fish, but for the working dog this ration is supplemented
by rice and tallow or other cereal and fat; not only because the animal
does better on it, but also because straight dried fish is a very bulky
food, and weight for weight goes not nearly so far. Cooking for the dogs
is troublesome, but economical of weight and bulk, and conserves the
vigour of the team. In the summer-time the dogs are still an expense.
They must be boarded at some fish camp, at a cost of about five dollars
per head per month.

The white man found the dog team in use amongst the natives all over the
interior, but he taught the Indian how to drive dogs. The natives had
never evolved a "leader." Some fleet stripling always ran ahead, and the
dogs followed. The leader, guided by the voice, "geeing" and "hawing,"
stopping and advancing at the word of command, is a white man's
innovation, though now universally adopted by the natives. So is the dog
collar. The "Siwash harness" is simply a band that goes round the
shoulders and over the breast. In the interior the universal "Siwash"
hitch was tandem, and is yet, but as trails have widened and improved,
more and more the tendency grows amongst white men to hitch two abreast;
and the most convenient rig is a lead line to which each dog is attached
independently by a single-tree, either two abreast, or, by adding a
further length to the lead line, one behind the other, so that on a
narrow trail the tandem rig may be quickly resorted to.

[Sidenote: THE DOCKING OF TAILS]

One advantage of the change from single to double rig is the decay of
the cruel custom of "bobbing" the dogs' tails. When dogs are hitched
one close behind the other (and the closer the better for pulling) the
tail of the dog in front becomes heavy with ice from the condensation of
the breath of the dog behind, until not only is he carrying weight but
the use of the tail for warmth at night is foregone. So it was the
universal practice to cut tails short off. But sleeping out in the open,
as travelling dogs often must do, in all sorts of weather, with the
thermometer at 50° or 60° below zero sometimes, a thick, bushy tail is a
great protection to a dog. With it he covers nose and feet and is tucked
up snug and warm. It is the dog's natural protection for the muzzle and
the thinly haired extremities. A few years ago almost all work dogs in
the interior were bobtailed; now the plumes wave over the teams again.

Five dogs are usually considered the minimum team, and seven dogs make a
good team. A good, quick-travelling load for a dog team is fifty pounds
to the dog, on ordinary trails. The dogs will pull as much as one
hundred pounds apiece or more, but that becomes more like freighting
than travelling. On a good level trail with strong big dogs, men
sometimes haul two hundred pounds to the dog. These, however, are
"gee-pole propositions," in the slang of the trail, and the man is doing
hard work with a band around his chest and the pole in his hand. For
quick travelling, fifty pounds to the dog is enough.

The most useful "outside" strains that the white man has introduced into
the dogs of the interior are the pointer and setter and collie. The
bird-dogs themselves make very fast teams and soon adapt themselves to
the climate, but their feet will not stand the strain. The collie's
intelligence would make him a most admirable leader, did he not have so
pronouncedly the faults of his good qualities; he wants to do all the
work; he works himself to death. It is the leader's business to keep the
team strung out; it is not his business to pull the load. But the
admixture of these strains with the native blood has produced some very
fine dogs. The Newfoundland and Saint Bernard strains have been perhaps
the least successful admixtures. They are too heavy and cumbersome and
always have tender feet; their bodies and the bodies of their mongrel
progeny are too heavy for their feet.

[Sidenote: DOG LOYALTY]

The last statement, with regard to Newfoundland and Saint Bernard dogs,
has an interesting exception. There is a dog, not uncommon in Alaska,
that by a curious inversion of phrase is known as the "one-man-dog."
What is meant is the "one-dog-man dog," the dog that belongs to the man
that uses only one dog. Many and many a prospector pulls his whole
winter grub-stake a hundred miles or more into the hills with the aid of
one dog. His progress is slow, in bad places or on up grades he must
relay, and all the time he is doing more work than the dog is, but he
manages to get his stuff to his cabin or his camp with no other aid than
one dog can give. It is usually a large heavy dog--speed never being
asked of him, nor steady continuous winter work--often of one of the
breeds mentioned, or of its predominant strain. The companionship
between such a man and such a dog is very close, and the understanding
complete. Sometimes the dog will be his master's sole society for the
whole winter.

Indeed, any man of feeling who spends the winters with a dog team must
grow to a deep sympathy with the animals, and to a keen, sometimes
almost a poignant, sense of what he owes to them. There is a mystery
about domestic animals of whatever kind. It is a mystery that man should
be able to impose his will upon them, change their habits and
characters, constrain them to his tasks, take up all their lives with
unnatural toil. And that he should get affection and devotion in return
makes the mystery yet more mysterious.

The dog gets his food--often of poor quality and scant quantity--and
that is all he gets. Yet the life of a work dog that has a kind and
considerate master is not an unhappy one. The dog is as full of the
canine joy of life as though he had never worn a collar, and not only
sports and gambols when free, but really seems to like his work and do
it gladly. He will chafe at inaction; he will come eagerly to the
harness in the morning; often will come before he is called and ask to
be harnessed; and if for any reason--lameness or galled neck or sore
feet--a dog is cut out of the team temporarily, to run loose, he will
try at every chance to get back into his place and will often attack the
dog that seems to him to be occupying it; while a dog left behind will
howl most piteously and make desperate efforts to break his chain and
rejoin his companions and his labour. And the wonderful and pitiful
thing about it is that no sort of severity or brutality on his master's
part will destroy that zealous allegiance. The dog in Alaska is
absolutely dependent upon man for subsistence, and he seems to realise
it.

There is a great deal of cruelty and brutality amongst dog drivers in
Alaska. At times, it is true, most dogs need some punishment. Dogs
differ as much as men do, and some are lazy and some are self-willed.
The best of them will develop bad trail habits if they are allowed
to--habits which will prove hard to break by and by and be a continual
source of delay and annoyance until broken. But a very slight
punishment, judicially administered at the moment, will usually suffice
just as well as a severe one, and the main source of brutality in the
punishment of dogs is sheer bad temper on the part of the driver, and
has for its only possible end, not the correction of the animal's fault
but the satisfaction of its owner's rage. To see some hulking,
passionate brute lashing a poor little dog with a chain, or beating him
with a club; to see dogs overworked to utter exhaustion and their
lagging steps still hastened by a rain of blows, these are the sickening
sights of the trail--and they are not uncommon. The language of most dog
drivers to their dogs consists of a mixture of cursing and ribaldry,
excused by the statement that only by the use of such speech may dogs be
driven at all. But there is little point in the excuse; such speech is,
to an extent not far from universal, the speech of the country. Swedes
who have little and Indians who have none other English will yet be
volubly profane and obscene; in the latter case often with complete
ignorance of the meaning of the terms. Yet it must be recorded not
ungratefully by the impartial observer that the rare presence of a
decent woman or a clergyman will almost always put a check upon
blackguardly speech, even that of a dog driver; women and clergymen
being supposed the only two classes who could have any possible
objection to foulness of mouth. To refer continually to the excrements
of the body, to sexual commerce, natural and unnatural, all in the
grossest terms, and to mix these matters intimately with the sacred
names, is "manly" speech amongst a large part of the population of
Alaska.

[Sidenote: REINDEER]

[Sidenote: REINDEER AS DRAUGHT ANIMALS]

It has been claimed with justice that the introduction of the reindeer
into Alaska has been highly successful; yet there is much misconception
amongst people "outside" as to the nature of that success. Stimulated by
the example of the United States Government, and urged thereto by Doctor
Wilfred Grenfell and others, the Canadian Government is now introducing
reindeer into Labrador; and the distinguished missionary physician,
whose recent decoration gives lustre to the royal bestower as well as to
the recipient, has publicly announced his hope that these domesticated
herbivora will "eliminate that scourge of the country, the husky dog."
To announce such a hope, based upon any results in Alaska, is to
announce misconception of the nature of the success which has attended
Doctor Sheldon Jackson's "reindeer experiment." There is not a dog the
less in Alaska because of the reindeer, nor ever will be; in so far as
similarity of conditions warrant us in expecting similar results, it is
safe to predict that the reindeer will never "eliminate the husky dog"
in Labrador.

But before discussing the success of the reindeer experiment and its
lack of any bearing upon the number or the usefulness of the dog, the
writer would pause to take strong exception to the description of the
husky dog as the "scourge" of Labrador, and would insist that any such
wholesale condemnation is a boomerang that returns upon the head of the
Labradorian who uses it. For, as the dog is one of the most adaptable of
all domestic animals, and is, to an amazing extent, what his master
makes him, to bring a railing accusation against the whole race of dogs
is in reality to accuse those who breed and rear them.

Why should the dog have richly earned the gratitude and affection of all
the world except Labrador? Why should he be called the "Friend of Man"
everywhere except amongst these particular people? Far to the north of
them the Esquimaux prize and cherish their dogs. Throughout the whole
wide region to the west and northwest of them the dog is man's
indispensable ally and faithful servant. The same husky dog has made
good his claim upon man in Alaska. It is he and his brother, the
malamute, that have opened up Alaska so far as it has been opened;
without whom to-day the development of the country would suddenly cease.
And to the question that is often asked "outside," as to whether the
Alaskan dog is not a savage beast, it is justly replied: "Not unless he
happens to belong to a savage beast." Is it really otherwise anywhere?
Instead of the reindeer eliminating the dog, there is far greater
likelihood of the dog eliminating the reindeer; and the professed dog
lover, indignant at the opprobrious term applied to a whole race of
dogs, may be disposed to echo Lady Macbeth's wish: "May good digestion
wait on appetite."

So far as substituting another draught animal for the dog is concerned,
if the whole equine tribe, even down to Manchurian ponies should for
some strange reason be out of the question, the Canadian Government had
better import the polar ox or the yak. It is only amongst a nomadic
people, whose main quest is pasturage, that the reindeer is a
satisfactory draught animal. When introduced into Alaska there was
doubtless expectation that he would be generally useful in this
capacity. For a while certain mail-routes on the Seward Peninsula were
served by him, and here and there a deluded prospector put his
grub-stake on a reindeer sled. It is safe to say that no reindeer are so
employed to-day. They were soon abandoned on the mail trails, and the
prospector, after one season's experience, slaughtered his reindeer and
traded its meat and hide for a couple of dogs.

Consider that the reindeer feeds upon one thing alone, the moss that is
named after him, and that while this moss is very widely distributed
indeed, throughout Alaska, it is not found at all in the river valleys
or the forests, but only upon the treeless hills at considerable
elevation. Now the rivers are the highways. It is on their frozen
surface, or on "portage" trails through the woods, that the greater part
of all travelling is done and, in particular, that established routes of
regular communication are maintained. To leave the trail after a day's
journey, to wander miles into the hills, to herd the deer while they
browse from slope to slope, digging the snow away in search of their
provender, is wholly incompatible with any sustained or regular travel.
The reindeer is a timid and almost defenceless creature. Wolves and
lynxes prey upon him. One lynx is thought to have killed upward of
twenty head in one season out of the herd that was stationed at Tanana,
leaping upon the backs of the creatures, cutting their throats, sucking
their blood, and riding them until they dropped and died. A few dogs
will soon work havoc in a herd. So the reindeer must be constantly
protected and at the same time must have range over a considerable scope
of country. The care of reindeer is a business in itself, not a mere
detail of the business of transportation or travel.

[Sidenote: DOG FOOD]

On the other hand, the dog's ration for many days is carried on the sled
he hauls. There is a definite limit to it, of course, and knowledge of
this limit made every experienced dog driver incredulous, from the
first, of Doctor Cook's claim to have travelled some eleven hundred
miles, from Etah to the North Pole and back, with a team of dogs hauling
their own food. It is possible, however, on fair trails, with rigid
economy, to travel five hundred miles and haul dog food and man food and
the other indispensables of a long journey; and that is twice as far as
it is ever necessary to travel in the interior of Alaska without
reaching a supply point, the northern slope to the Arctic Ocean
excepted.

Perhaps it would be putting it better to say that a team of seven dogs
can haul their own and their driver's food and the camp equipment, all,
of course, carefully reduced to a minimum, for a month. Dog food of one
sort or another can be bought at any place where anything whatever is
sold. Almost any Indian village will furnish dried fish, and it is often
possible, with no other weapon than a .22 rifle, to feed dogs largely on
the country through which they pass. The writer's team has had many a
meal of ptarmigan, rabbits, quail, and spruce hen, while to enumerate
other articles, on which at times and in stress for proper food, his
dogs have sustained life and strength for travel, would be to enumerate
all the common human comestibles. Aside from the usual ration of fish,
tallow, and rice boiled together, corn-meal, beans, flour, oatmeal, sago
(though that is poor stuff), tapioca, canned meats of all kinds, canned
salmon, even canned kippered herring from Scotland, seal oil, seal and
whale flesh, ham and bacon, horse flesh, moose and caribou and
mountain-sheep flesh, canned "Boston brown bread," canned butter, canned
milk, dried apples, sugar, cheese, crackers of all kinds, and a score of
other matters have at times entered into their food. Dogs have been
"tided over" tight places for days and days on horse oats boiled with
tallow candles, working the while. Anything that a man can eat, and much
that even a starving man would scarcely eat, will make food for dogs. At
the last and worst, dog can be fed to dog and even to man. When a dog
team reaches a mining camp where supplies of all sorts are scarce--and
that is not an uncommon experience--it is sometimes an exceedingly
expensive matter to feed it; but something can always be found that
will serve to keep it going until the return to a better-stocked region.
In the winter of 1910-11, when there was such scarcity in the Iditarod,
it cost the writer thirty-nine dollars and fifty cents to feed seven
dogs for a week, and he has more than once been at almost a similar
charge in the Koyukuk. But in all his travels he has never yet been
unable to procure some sort of food for his dogs. At times they have
been fed for days on rabbits straight; at times on ptarmigan straight.

[Sidenote: THE REINDEER'S USEFULNESS]

Speaking broadly, the reindeer is a stupid, unwieldy, and intractable
brute, not comparing for a moment with the dog in intelligence or
adaptability. The common notion that his name is derived from the use of
reins in driving him, thus putting him in the class with the horse, is a
mistake; the word comes from a Norse root which refers to his
moss-browsing habit. The "rein" with which he is driven is a rope tied
around one of his horns. He has no cognisance of "gee" and "haw," nor of
any other vocal direction, but must be yanked hither and thither with
the rope by main force; while to stop him in his mad career, once he is
started, it is often necessary to throw him with the rope. In Lapland
there are doubtless individual deer better trained; the Lap herders tell
of them with pride; but in the main this is a just description of
reindeer handling. All the chief herders in Alaska are Laps, brought
over for their knowledge of the animals, and the writer has repeatedly
ridden behind some of their best deer.

Wherein, then, lies the success of the reindeer experiment in Alaska?
Chiefly in the provision of a regular meat supply by which the natives
and whites in the vicinity of a herd are relieved from the
precariousness of the chase or the rapacity of the cold-storage butcher
company. The Esquimau, having served his allotted apprenticeship of five
years and entered upon possession of a herd, can at any time kill and
dress a "kid of the flock" for his family or for the market. The price
of butcher's meat has been kept down all over the Seward Peninsula by
the competition of the numerous reindeer herds, to the comfort of the
population and the exasperation of the butcher company, and many an
Esquimau has become passably rich. The skin of the animal also furnishes
a warm and much-needed material for clothing and finds a ready sale at a
good price.

This success is, however, confined so far to the coast. The herds have
not thriven in the interior and have now all been withdrawn to the
coast. Beasts of prey killed them; a hoof disease destroyed many; others
are supposed to have died from eating some poisonous fungus. In five or
six years the herd at Tanana had not increased at all, but rather
diminished, and the same is true of the other herds on the Yukon. The
Indian, moreover, does not take to herding as the Esquimau does, and can
hardly be induced to the segregation of himself and his family from his
tribe which reindeer herding involves. The "apprentices" on the Yukon
were nearly all of them Esquimaux from the coast.

It may be that the salt of the coast region is essential to the
well-being of the reindeer; it is not so with the caribou--and the
reindeer is nothing but a domesticated caribou--many herds of which, in
the interior of Alaska, never visit the coast at all; but all caribou
herds have their salt-licks, and one wishes that the oft-recommended
plan of furnishing salt for the herds in the interior had been adopted
by the government for a season before their removal was determined upon.

Like most other "resources" of Alaska, the imported reindeer, at first
decried and ridiculed, has now become the slender foundation for
extravagant speculations of prosperity. The "millions of acres waiting
for the plough" in the interior have lately been supplemented in this
visionary treasury by the capitalisation of the vast tundras of the
coast, the golden wheat-fields of the one finding counterpart in the
multitudinous herds of the other. The growing dearth of cattle-range in
the United States offers, it seems, to Alaska the opportunity of
supplying the American market with meat, and the kindling fancy of the
enthusiastic "booster" sees trains loaded with frozen reindeer meat
rolling into Chicago.

While the reindeer will never supersede the dog as a draught animal
anywhere, the horse is rapidly superseding him on good trails in the
more settled and peopled regions. In the Fairbanks and Nome districts,
in the Circle and Koyukuk districts, in the Fortymile and in the
Iditarod--in all districts where any extensive mining is carried
on--heavy freights are moved by horses, and this tendency will doubtless
increase rather than diminish. The dog team cannot compete with the
horse team when it comes to moving heavy loads over good trails. The
grain that the horse eats is imported, and in the main will probably
always be imported, but oats cut green and properly cared for make
excellent fodder, and the native hay, while not nearly as nutritious as
the imported timothy, will sufficiently supplement grain.

We hear a great deal nowadays of the benefits which are to come to
Alaska from the railroad which the United States is expected to build
from tide-water to the Yukon, and the clamorous voices of the journalist
and the professional promoter and politician, which seem the only voices
which ever reach the ear of government, are insistent that this is the
one great thing that will bring prosperity to the country. Yet the
writer is confident that he expresses almost the unanimous opinion of
those who live in the country, outside of the classes mentioned, when he
says that if the amount of money which this railroad will cost were
expended upon good highways and trails the benefit would be much
greater. It is means of intercommunication between the various parts of
the country that is the great need of Alaska; some of its most promising
sections are almost inaccessible now or accessible only at great trouble
and expense. Access to the country itself, for the introduction of
merchandise, is furnished easily enough during three or four months of
the year by its incomparable system of waterways. Good highways, well
engineered and well maintained, over which horse teams could be used
summer and winter, would remove much of what at present is the almost
prohibitive cost of distributing that merchandise from river points.
Such roads would give an enormous stimulus to prospecting, and would
render it possible to work gold placers all over the country that are of
too low grade to be worked at the present rates of transportation. A
_really_ good highway from Valdez to Fairbanks and the making of the
long-ago begun Valdez-Eagle road; a good highway from Fairbanks to the
upper Tanana as far as the Nabesna, connecting with the one from the
Copper River country and the coast; another from the Yukon into the
Koyukuk and the Chandalar; another from Fairbanks into the Kantishna,
connecting with one from the lower Kuskokwim and one from the Iditarod;
a road from Eagle across the almost unknown region (save for the line of
the 141st meridian) between the Yukon and the Porcupine Rivers; two or
three roads between the Yukon and the Tanana; a road from the Koyukuk to
Kotzebue Sound--these would constitute main arteries of travel and would
open up the country as no trunk railroad will ever do. The expense would
be great, both of construction and maintenance, but it would probably
not be greater than the cost of constructing and maintaining the
proposed railroad. Twenty or thirty ordinary freight trains a year would
bring in all the goods that Alaska consumes. Before that amount can be
very greatly increased there must be a large development of the means by
which it is to be distributed throughout the country.

Some day, perhaps, these roads will be made, and the horse, not the dog,
will be the draught animal upon them. Yet it would be a rash conclusion
that even then the time will be at hand when there will be no longer
use for the work dog in Alaska. Away from these main arteries of travel
he will still be employed. So long as great part of the land remains a
noble arctic wilderness; so long as the prospector strikes farther and
farther into the rugged mountains; so long as quick travel over great
stretches of country is necessary or desirable; so long as the salmon
swarm up the rivers to furnish food for the catching; so long as the
Indian moves from fishing camp to village and from village to hunting
camp--so long will the dog be hitched to the sled in Alaska; so long
will his joyful yelp and his plaintive whine be heard in the land; so
long will his warm tongue seek his master's hand, even the hand that
strikes him, and his eloquent eyes speak his utter allegiance.

Preface


Forty years ago John Muir wrote to a friend; â€œI am hopelessly and
forever a mountaineer. . . . Civilization and fever, and all the
morbidness that has been hooted at me, have not dimmed my glacial eyes,
and I care to live only to entice people to look at Natureâ€™s
loveliness.â€ How gloriously he fulfilled the promise of his early
manhood! Fame, all unbidden, wore a path to his door, but he always
remained a modest, unspoiled mountaineer. Kindred spirits, the greatest
of his time, sought him out, even in his mountain cabin, and felt
honored by his friendship. Ralph Waldo Emerson urged him to visit
Concord and rest awhile from the strain of his solitary studies in the
Sierra Nevada. But nothing could dislodge him from the glacial problems
of the high Sierra; with passionate interest he kept at his task. â€œThe
grandeur of these forces and their glorious results,â€ he once wrote,
â€œoverpower me and inhabit my whole being. Waking or sleeping, I have no
rest. In dreams I read blurred sheets of glacial writing, or follow
lines of cleavage, or struggle with the difficulties of some
extraordinary rock-form.â€

There is a note of pathos, the echo of an unfulfilled hope, in the
record of his later visit to Concord. â€œIt was seventeen years after our
parting on Wawona ridge that I stood beside his [Emersonâ€™s] grave under
a pine tree on the hill above Sleepy Hollow. He had gone to higher
Sierras, and, as I fancied, was again waving his hand in friendly
recognition.â€ And now John Muir has followed his friend of other days
to the â€œhigher Sierras.â€ His earthly remains lie among trees planted by
his own hand. To the pine tree of Sleepy Hollow answers a guardian
sequoia in the sunny Alhambra Valley.

In 1879 John Muir went to Alaska for the first time. Its stupendous
living glaciers aroused his unbounded interest, for they enabled him to
verify his theories of glacial action. Again and again he returned to
this continental laboratory of landscapes. The greatest of the
tide-water glaciers appropriately commemorates his name. Upon this book
of Alaska travels, all but finished before his unforeseen departure,
John Muir expended the last months of his life. It was begun soon after
his return from Africa in 1912. His eager leadership of the ill-fated
campaign to save his beloved Hetch-Hetchy Valley from commercial
destruction seriously interrupted his labors. Illness, also, interposed
some checks as he worked with characteristic care and thoroughness
through the great mass of Alaska notes that had accumulated under his
hands for more than thirty years.

The events recorded in this volume end in the middle of the trip of
1890. Muirâ€™s notes on the remainder of the journey have not been found,
and it is idle to speculate how he would have concluded the volume if
he had lived to complete it. But no one will read the fascinating
description of the Northern Lights without feeling a poetical
appropriateness in the fact that his last work ends with a portrayal of
the aurorasâ€”one of those phenomena which elsewhere he described as â€œthe
most glorious of all the terrestrial manifestations of God.â€

Muirâ€™s manuscripts bear on every page impressive evidence of the pains
he took in his literary work, and the lofty standard he set himself in
his scientific studies. The counterfeiting of a fact or of an
experience was a thing unthinkable in connection with John Muir. He was
tireless in pursuing the meaning of a physiographical fact, and his
extraordinary physical endurance usually enabled him to trail it to its
last hiding-place. Often, when telling the tale of his adventures in
Alaska, his eyes would kindle with youthful enthusiasm, and he would
live over again the red-blooded years that yielded him â€œshapeless
harvests of revealed glory.â€

For a number of months just prior to his death he had the friendly
assistance of Mrs. Marion Randall Parsons. Her familiarity with the
manuscript, and with Mr. Muirâ€™s expressed and penciled intentions of
revision and arrangement, made her the logical person to prepare it in
final form for publication. It was a task to which she brought devotion
as well as ability. The labor involved was the greater in order that
the finished work might exhibit the last touches of Muirâ€™s master-hand,
and yet contain nothing that did not flow from his pen. All readers of
this book will feel grateful for her labor of love.

I add these prefatory lines to the work of my departed friend with
pensive misgiving, knowing that he would have deprecated any discharge
of musketry over his grave. His daughters, Mrs. Thomas Rea Hanna and
Mrs. Buel Alvin Funk, have honored me with the request to transmit the
manuscript for publication, and later to consider with them what
salvage may be made from among their fatherâ€™s unpublished writings.
They also wish me to express their grateful acknowledgments to Houghton
Mifflin Company, with whom John Muir has always maintained close and
friendly relations.

Travels in Alaska




Part I
_The Trip of 1879_




Chapter I
Puget Sound and British Columbia


After eleven years of study and exploration in the Sierra Nevada of
California and the mountain-ranges of the Great Basin, studying in
particular their glaciers, forests, and wild life, above all their
ancient glaciers and the influence they exerted in sculpturing the
rocks over which they passed with tremendous pressure, making new
landscapes, scenery, and beauty which so mysteriously influence every
human being, and to some extent all life, I was anxious to gain some
knowledge of the regions to the northward, about Puget Sound and
Alaska. With this grand object in view I left San Francisco in May,
1879, on the steamer Dakota, without any definite plan, as with the
exception of a few of the Oregon peaks and their forests all the wild
north was new to me.

To the mountaineer a sea voyage is a grand, inspiring, restful change.
For forests and plains with their flowers and fruits we have new
scenery, new life of every sort; water hills and dales in eternal
visible motion for rock waves, types of permanence.

It was curious to note how suddenly the eager countenances of the
passengers were darkened as soon as the good ship passed through the
Golden Gate and began to heave on the waves of the open ocean. The
crowded deck was speedily deserted on account of seasickness. It seemed
strange that nearly every one afflicted should be more or less ashamed.

Next morning a strong wind was blowing, and the sea was gray and white,
with long breaking waves, across which the Dakota was racing
half-buried in spray. Very few of the passengers were on deck to enjoy
the wild scenery. Every wave seemed to be making enthusiastic, eager
haste to the shore, with long, irised tresses streaming from its tops,
some of its outer fringes borne away in scud to refresh the wind, all
the rolling, pitching, flying water exulting in the beauty of rainbow
light. Gulls and albatrosses, strong, glad life in the midst of the
stormy beauty, skimmed the waves against the wind, seemingly without
effort, oftentimes flying nearly a mile without a single wing-beat,
gracefully swaying from side to side and tracing the curves of the
briny water hills with the finest precision, now and then just grazing
the highest.

And yonder, glistening amid the irised spray, is still more striking
revelation of warm life in the so-called howling waste,â€”a half-dozen
whales, their broad backs like glaciated bosses of granite heaving
aloft in near view, spouting lustily, drawing a long breath, and
plunging down home in colossal health and comfort. A merry school of
porpoises, a square mile of them, suddenly appear, tossing themselves
into the air in abounding strength and hilarity, adding foam to the
waves and making all the wilderness wilder. One cannot but feel
sympathy with and be proud of these brave neighbors, fellow citizens in
the commonwealth of the world, making a living like the rest of us. Our
good ship also seemed like a thing of life, its great iron heart
beating on through calm and storm, a truly noble spectacle. But think
of the hearts of these whales, beating warm against the sea, day and
night, through dark and light, on and on for centuries; how the red
blood must rush and gurgle in and out, bucketfuls, barrelfuls at a
beat!

The cloud colors of one of the four sunsets enjoyed on the voyage were
remarkably pure and rich in tone. There was a well-defined range of
cumuli a few degrees above the horizon, and a massive, dark-gray
rain-cloud above it, from which depended long, bent fringes overlapping
the lower cumuli and partially veiling them; and from time to time
sunbeams poured through narrow openings and painted the exposed bosses
and fringes in ripe yellow tones, which, with the reflections on the
water, made magnificent pictures. The scenery of the ocean, however
sublime in vast expanse, seems far less beautiful to us dry-shod
animals than that of the land seen only in comparatively small patches;
but when we contemplate the whole globe as one great dewdrop, striped
and dotted with continents and islands, flying through space with other
stars all singing and shining together as one, the whole universe
appears as an infinite storm of beauty.

The California coast-hills and cliffs look bare and uninviting as seen
from the ship, the magnificent forests keeping well back out of sight
beyond the reach of the sea winds; those of Oregon and Washington are
in some places clad with conifers nearly down to the shore; even the
little detached islets, so marked a feature to the northward, are
mostly tree-crowned. Up through the Straits of Juan de Fuca the
forests, sheltered from the ocean gales and favored with abundant
rains, flourish in marvelous luxuriance on the glacier-sculptured
mountains of the Olympic Range.

We arrived in Esquimault Harbor, three miles from Victoria, on the
evening of the fourth day, and drove to the town through a magnificent
forest of Douglas spruce,â€”with an undergrowth in open spots of oak,
madrone, hazel, dogwood, alder, spirÃ¦a, willow, and wild rose,â€”and
around many an upswelling _moutonnÃ©_ rock, freshly glaciated and furred
with yellow mosses and lichens.

Victoria, the capital of British Columbia, was in 1879 a small
old-fashioned English town on the south end of Vancouver Island. It was
said to contain about six thousand inhabitants. The government
buildings and some of the business blocks were noticeable, but the
attention of the traveler was more worthily attracted to the neat
cottage homes found here, embowered in the freshest and floweriest
climbing roses and honeysuckles conceivable. Californians may well be
proud of their home roses loading sunny verandas, climbing to the tops
of the roofs and falling over the gables in white and red cascades. But
here, with so much bland fog and dew and gentle laving rain, a still
finer development of some of the commonest garden plants is reached.
English honeysuckle seems to have found here a most congenial home.
Still more beautiful were the wild roses, blooming in wonderful
luxuriance along the woodland paths, with corollas two and three inches
wide. This rose and three species of spirÃ¦a fairly filled the air with
fragrance after showers; and how brightly then did the red dogwood
berries shine amid the green leaves beneath trees two hundred and fifty
feet high.

Strange to say, all of this exuberant forest and flower vegetation was
growing upon fresh moraine material scarcely at all moved or in any way
modified by post-glacial agents. In the town gardens and orchards,
peaches and apples fell upon glacier-polished rocks, and the streets
were graded in moraine gravel; and I observed scratched and grooved
rock bosses as unweathered and telling as those of the High Sierra of
California eight thousand feet or more above sea-level. The Victoria
Harbor is plainly glacial in origin, eroded from the solid; and the
rock islets that rise here and there in it are unchanged to any
appreciable extent by all the waves that have broken over them since
first they came to light toward the close of the glacial period. The
shores also of the harbor are strikingly grooved and scratched and in
every way as glacial in all their characteristics as those of new-born
glacial lakes. That the domain of the sea is being slowly extended over
the land by incessant wave-action is well known; but in this freshly
glaciated region the shores have been so short a time exposed to
wave-action that they are scarcely at all wasted. The extension of the
sea affected by its own action in post-glacial times is probably less
than the millionth part of that affected by glacial action during the
last glacier period. The direction of the flow of the ice-sheet to
which all the main features of this wonderful region are due was in
general southward.

From this quiet little English town I made many short excursionsâ€”up the
coast to Nanaimo, to Burrard Inlet, now the terminus of the Canadian
Pacific Railroad, to Puget Sound, up Fraser River to New Westminster
and Yale at the head of navigation, charmed everywhere with the wild,
new-born scenery. The most interesting of these and the most difficult
to leave was the Puget Sound region, famous the world over for the
wonderful forests of gigantic trees about its shores. It is an arm and
many-fingered hand of the sea, reaching southward from the Straits of
Juan de Fuca about a hundred miles into the heart of one of the noblest
coniferous forests on the face of the globe. All its scenery is
wonderfulâ€”broad river-like reaches sweeping in beautiful curves around
bays and capes and jutting promontories, opening here and there into
smooth, blue, lake-like expanses dotted with islands and feathered with
tall, spiry evergreens, their beauty doubled on the bright
mirror-water.

Sailing from Victoria, the Olympic Mountains are seen right ahead,
rising in bold relief against the sky, with jagged crests and peaks
from six to eight thousand feet high,â€”small residual glaciers and
ragged snow-fields beneath them in wide amphitheatres opening down
through the forest-filled valleys. These valleys mark the courses of
the Olympic glaciers at the period of their greatest extension, when
they poured their tribute into that portion of the great northern
ice-sheet that overswept Vancouver Island and filled the strait between
it and the mainland.

On the way up to Olympia, then a hopeful little town situated at the
end of one of the longest fingers of the Sound, one is often reminded
of Lake Tahoe, the scenery of the widest expanses is so lake-like in
the clearness and stillness of the water and the luxuriance of the
surrounding forests. Doubling cape after cape, passing uncounted
islands, new combinations break on the view in endless variety,
sufficient to satisfy the lover of wild beauty through a whole life.
When the clouds come down, blotting out everything, one feels as if at
sea; again lifting a little, some islet may be seen standing alone with
the tops of its trees dipping out of sight in gray misty fringes; then
the ranks of spruce and cedar bounding the waterâ€™s edge come to view;
and when at length the whole sky is clear the colossal cone of Mt.
Rainier may be seen in spotless white, looking down over the dark woods
from a distance of fifty or sixty miles, but so high and massive and so
sharply outlined, it seems to be just back of a strip of woods only a
few miles wide.

Mt. Rainier, or Tahoma (the Indian name), is the noblest of the
volcanic cones extending from Lassen Butte and Mt. Shasta along the
Cascade Range to Mt. Baker. One of the most telling views of it
hereabouts is obtained near Tacoma. From a bluff back of the town it
was revealed in all its glory, laden with glaciers and snow down to the
forested foothills around its finely curved base. Up to this time
(1879) it had been ascended but once. From observations made on the
summit with a single aneroid barometer, it was estimated to be about
14,500 feet high. Mt. Baker, to the northward, is about 10,700 feet
high, a noble mountain. So also are Mt. Adams, Mt. St. Helens, and Mt.
Hood. The latter, overlooking the town of Portland, is perhaps the best
known. Rainier, about the same height as Shasta, surpasses them all in
massive icy grandeur,â€”the most majestic solitary mountain I had ever
yet beheld. How eagerly I gazed and longed to climb it and study its
history only the mountaineer may know, but I was compelled to turn away
and bide my time.

The species forming the bulk of the woods here is the Douglas spruce
(_Pseudotsuga douglasii_), one of the greatest of the western giants. A
specimen that I measured near Olympia was about three hundred feet in
height and twelve feet in diameter four feet above the ground. It is a
widely distributed tree, extending northward through British Columbia,
southward through Oregon and California, and eastward to the Rocky
Mountains. The timber is used for shipbuilding, spars, piles, and the
framework of houses, bridges, etc. In the California lumber markets it
is known as â€œOregon pine.â€ In Utah, where it is common on the Wahsatch
Mountains, it is called â€œred pine.â€ In California, on the western slope
of the Sierra Nevada, it forms, in company with the yellow pine, sugar
pine, and incense cedar, a pretty well-defined belt at a height of from
three to six thousand feet above the sea; but it is only in Oregon and
Washington, especially in this Puget Sound region, that it reaches its
very grandest development,â€”tall, straight, and strong, growing down
close to tidewater.

All the towns of the Sound had a hopeful, thrifty aspect. Port
Townsend, picturesquely located on a grassy bluff, was the port of
clearance for vessels sailing to foreign parts. Seattle was famed for
its coal-mines, and claimed to be the coming town of the North Pacific
Coast. So also did its rival, Tacoma, which had been selected as the
terminus of the much-talked-of Northern Pacific Railway. Several
coal-veins of astonishing thickness were discovered the winter before
on the Carbon River, to the east of Tacoma, one of them said to be no
less than twenty-one feet, another twenty feet, another fourteen, with
many smaller ones, the aggregate thickness of all the veins being
upwards of a hundred feet. Large deposits of magnetic iron ore and
brown hematite, together with limestone, had been discovered in
advantageous proximity to the coal, making a bright outlook for the
Sound region in general in connection with its railroad hopes, its
unrivaled timber resources, and its far-reaching geographical
relations.

After spending a few weeks in the Puget Sound with a friend from San
Francisco, we engaged passage on the little mail steamer California, at
Portland, Oregon, for Alaska. The sail down the broad lower reaches of
the Columbia and across its foamy bar, around Cape Flattery, and up the
Juan de Fuca Strait, was delightful; and after calling again at
Victoria and Port Townsend we got fairly off for icy Alaska.




Chapter II
Alexander Archipelago and the Home I found in Alaska


To the lover of pure wildness Alaska is one of the most wonderful
countries in the world. No excursion that I know of may be made into
any other American wilderness where so marvelous an abundance of noble,
newborn scenery is so charmingly brought to view as on the trip through
the Alexander Archipelago to Fort Wrangell and Sitka. Gazing from the
deck of the steamer, one is borne smoothly over calm blue waters,
through the midst of countless forest-clad islands. The ordinary
discomforts of a sea voyage are not felt, for nearly all the whole long
way is on inland waters that are about as waveless as rivers and lakes.
So numerous are the islands that they seem to have been sown broadcast;
long tapering vistas between the largest of them open in every
direction.

Day after day in the fine weather we enjoyed, we seemed to float in
true fairyland, each succeeding view seeming more and more beautiful,
the one we chanced to have before us the most surprisingly beautiful of
all. Never before this had I been embosomed in scenery so hopelessly
beyond description. To sketch picturesque bits, definitely bounded, is
comparatively easyâ€”a lake in the woods, a glacier meadow, or a cascade
in its dell; or even a grand master view of mountains beheld from some
commanding outlook after climbing from height to height above the
forests. These may be attempted, and more or less telling pictures made
of them; but in these coast landscapes there is such indefinite,
on-leading expansiveness, such a multitude of features without apparent
redundance, their lines graduating delicately into one another in
endless succession, while the whole is so fine, so tender, so ethereal,
that all pen-work seems hopelessly unavailing. Tracing shining ways
through fiord and sound, past forests and waterfalls, islands and
mountains and far azure headlands, it seems as if surely we must at
length reach the very paradise of the poets, the abode of the blessed.

[Illustration: Hanging Valley and Waterfall, Fraser Ranch.]

Some idea of the wealth of this scenery may be gained from the fact
that the coast-line of Alaska is about twenty-six thousand miles long,
more than twice as long as all the rest of the United States. The
islands of the Alexander Archipelago, with the straits, channels,
canals, sounds, passages, and fiords, form an intricate web of land and
water embroidery sixty or seventy miles wide, fringing the lofty icy
chain of coast mountains from Puget Sound to Cook Inlet; and, with
infinite variety, the general pattern is harmonious throughout its
whole extent of nearly a thousand miles. Here you glide into a narrow
channel hemmed in by mountain walls, forested down to the waterâ€™s edge,
where there is no distant view, and your attention is concentrated on
the objects close about youâ€”the crowded spires of the spruces and
hemlocks rising higher and higher on the steep green slopes; stripes of
paler green where winter avalanches have cleared away the trees,
allowing grasses and willows to spring up; zigzags of cascades
appearing and disappearing among the bushes and trees; short, steep
glens with brawling streams hidden beneath alder and dogwood, seen only
where they emerge on the brown algÃ¦ of the shore; and retreating
hollows, with lingering snow-banks marking the fountains of ancient
glaciers. The steamer is often so near the shore that you may
distinctly see the cones clustered on the tops of the trees, and the
ferns and bushes at their feet.

But new scenes are brought to view with magical rapidity. Rounding some
bossy cape, the eye is called away into far-reaching vistas, bounded on
either hand by headlands in charming array, one dipping gracefully
beyond another and growing fainter and more ethereal in the distance.
The tranquil channel stretching river-like between, may be stirred here
and there by the silvery plashing of upspringing salmon, or by flocks
of white gulls floating like water-lilies among the sun spangles; while
mellow, tempered sunshine is streaming over all, blending sky, land,
and water in pale, misty blue. Then, while you are dreamily gazing into
the depths of this leafy ocean lane, the little steamer, seeming hardly
larger than a duck, turning into some passage not visible until the
moment of entering it, glides into a wide expanseâ€”a sound filled with
islands, sprinkled and clustered in forms and compositions such as
nature alone can invent; some of them so small the trees growing on
them seem like single handfuls culled from the neighboring woods and
set in the water to keep them fresh, while here and there at wide
intervals you may notice bare rocks just above the water, mere dots
punctuating grand, outswelling sentences of islands.

The variety we find, both as to the contours and the collocation of the
islands, is due chiefly to differences in the structure and composition
of their rocks, and the unequal glacial denudation different portions
of the coast were subjected to. This influence must have been
especially heavy toward the end of the glacial period, when the main
ice-sheet began to break up into separate glaciers. Moreover, the
mountains of the larger islands nourished local glaciers, some of them
of considerable size, which sculptured their summits and sides, forming
in some cases wide cirques with caÃ±ons or valleys leading down from
them into the channels and sounds. These causes have produced much of
the bewildering variety of which nature is so fond, but none the less
will the studious observer see the underlying harmonyâ€”the general trend
of the islands in the direction of the flow of the main ice-mantle from
the mountains of the Coast Range, more or less varied by subordinate
foothill ridges and mountains. Furthermore, all the islands, great and
small, as well as the headlands and promontories of the mainland, are
seen to have a rounded, over-rubbed appearance produced by the
over-sweeping ice-flood during the period of greatest glacial
abundance.

The canals, channels, straits, passages, sounds, etc., are subordinate
to the same glacial conditions in their forms, trends, and extent as
those which determined the forms, trends, and distribution of the
land-masses, their basins being the parts of the pre-glacial margin of
the continent, eroded to varying depths below sea-level, and into
which, of course, the ocean waters flowed as the ice was melted out of
them. Had the general glacial denudation been much less, these ocean
ways over which we are sailing would have been valleys and caÃ±ons and
lakes; and the islands rounded hills and ridges, landscapes with
undulating features like those found above sea-level wherever the rocks
and glacial conditions are similar. In general, the island-bound
channels are like rivers, not only in separate reaches as seen from the
deck of a vessel, but continuously so for hundreds of miles in the case
of the longest of them. The tide-currents, the fresh driftwood, the
inflowing streams, and the luxuriant foliage of the out-leaning trees
on the shores make this resemblance all the more complete. The largest
islands look like part of the mainland in any view to be had of them
from the ship, but far the greater number are small, and appreciable as
islands, scores of them being less than a mile long. These the eye
easily takes in and revels in their beauty with ever fresh delight. In
their relations to each other the individual members of a group have
evidently been derived from the same general rock-mass, yet they never
seem broken or abridged in any way as to their contour lines, however
abruptly they may dip their sides. Viewed one by one, they seem
detached beauties, like extracts from a poem, while, from the
completeness of their lines and the way that their trees are arranged,
each seems a finished stanza in itself. Contemplating the arrangement
of the trees on these small islands, a distinct impression is produced
of their having been sorted and harmonized as to size like a
well-balanced bouquet. On some of the smaller tufted islets a group of
tapering spruces is planted in the middle, and two smaller groups that
evidently correspond with each other are planted on the ends at about
equal distances from the central group; or the whole appears as one
group with marked fringing trees that match each other spreading around
the sides, like flowers leaning outward against the rim of a vase.
These harmonious tree relations are so constant that they evidently are
the result of design, as much so as the arrangement of the feathers of
birds or the scales of fishes.

Thus perfectly beautiful are these blessed evergreen islands, and their
beauty is the beauty of youth, for though the freshness of their
verdure must be ascribed to the bland moisture with which they are
bathed from warm ocean-currents, the very existence of the islands,
their features, finish, and peculiar distribution, are all immediately
referable to ice-action during the great glacial winter just now
drawing to a close.

[Illustration: Lowe Inlet, British Columbia.]

We arrived at Wrangell July 14, and after a short stop of a few hours
went on to Sitka and returned on the 20th to Wrangell, the most
inhospitable place at first sight I had ever seen. The little steamer
that had been my home in the wonderful trip through the archipelago,
after taking the mail, departed on her return to Portland, and as I
watched her gliding out of sight in the dismal blurring rain, I felt
strangely lonesome. The friend that had accompanied me thus far now
left for his home in San Francisco, with two other interesting
travelers who had made the trip for health and scenery, while my fellow
passengers, the missionaries, went direct to the Presbyterian home in
the old fort. There was nothing like a tavern or lodging-house in the
village, nor could I find any place in the stumpy, rocky, boggy ground
about it that looked dry enough to camp on until I could find a way
into the wilderness to begin my studies. Every place within a mile or
two of the town seemed strangely shelterless and inhospitable, for all
the trees had long ago been felled for building-timber and firewood. At
the worst, I thought, I could build a bark hut on a hill back of the
village, where something like a forest loomed dimly through the
draggled clouds.

I had already seen some of the high glacier-bearing mountains in
distant views from the steamer, and was anxious to reach them. A few
whites of the village, with whom I entered into conversation, warned me
that the Indians were a bad lot, not to be trusted, that the woods were
well-nigh impenetrable, and that I could go nowhere without a canoe. On
the other hand, these natural difficulties made the grand wild country
all the more attractive, and I determined to get into the heart of it
somehow or other with a bag of hardtack, trusting to my usual good
luck. My present difficulty was in finding a first base camp. My only
hope was on the hill. When I was strolling past the old fort I happened
to meet one of the missionaries, who kindly asked me where I was going
to take up my quarters.

â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ I replied. â€œI have not been able to find quarters of
any sort. The top of that little hill over there seems the only
possible place.â€

He then explained that every room in the mission house was full, but he
thought I might obtain leave to spread my blanket in a carpenter-shop
belonging to the mission. Thanking him, I ran down to the sloppy wharf
for my little bundle of baggage, laid it on the shop floor, and felt
glad and snug among the dry, sweet-smelling shavings.

The carpenter was at work on a new Presbyterian mission building, and
when he came in I explained that Dr. Jackson[1] had suggested that I
might be allowed to sleep on the floor, and after I assured him that I
would not touch his tools or be in his way, he goodnaturedly gave me
the freedom of the shop and also of his small private side room where I
would find a wash-basin.

I was here only one night, however, for Mr. Vanderbilt, a merchant, who
with his family occupied the best house in the fort, hearing that one
of the late arrivals, whose business none seemed to know, was compelled
to sleep in the carpenter-shop, paid me a good-Samaritan visit and
after a few explanatory words on my glacier and forest studies, with
fine hospitality offered me a room and a place at his table. Here I
found a real home, with freedom to go on all sorts of excursions as
opportunity offered. Annie Vanderbilt, a little doctor of divinity two
years old, ruled the household with love sermons and kept it warm.

Mr. Vanderbilt introduced me to prospectors and traders and some of the
most influential of the Indians. I visited the mission school and the
home for Indian girls kept by Mrs. MacFarland, and made short
excursions to the nearby forests and streams, and studied the rate of
growth of the different species of trees and their age, counting the
annual rings on stumps in the large clearings made by the military when
the fort was occupied, causing wondering speculation among the Wrangell
folk, as was reported by Mr. Vanderbilt.

â€œWhat can the fellow be up to?â€ they inquired. â€œHe seems to spend most
of his time among stumps and weeds. I saw him the other day on his
knees, looking at a stump as if he expected to find gold in it. He
seems to have no serious object whatever.â€

One night when a heavy rainstorm was blowing I unwittingly caused a lot
of wondering excitement among the whites as well as the superstitious
Indians. Being anxious to see how the Alaska trees behave in storms and
hear the songs they sing, I stole quietly away through the gray
drenching blast to the hill back of the town, without being observed.
Night was falling when I set out and it was pitch dark when I reached
the top. The glad, rejoicing storm in glorious voice was singing
through the woods, noble compensation for mere body discomfort. But I
wanted a fire, a big one, to see as well as hear how the storm and
trees were behaving. After long, patient groping I found a little dry
punk in a hollow trunk and carefully stored it beside my matchbox and
an inch or two of candle in an inside pocket that the rain had not yet
reached; then, wiping some dead twigs and whittling them into thin
shavings, stored them with the punk. I then made a little conical bark
hut about a foot high, and, carefully leaning over it and sheltering it
as much as possible from the driving rain, I wiped and stored a lot of
dead twigs, lighted the candle, and set it in the hut, carefully added
pinches of punk and shavings, and at length got a little blaze, by the
light of which I gradually added larger shavings, then twigs all set on
end astride the inner flame, making the little hut higher and wider.
Soon I had light enough to enable me to select the best dead branches
and large sections of bark, which were set on end, gradually increasing
the height and corresponding light of the hut fire. A considerable area
was thus well lighted, from which I gathered abundance of wood, and
kept adding to the fire until it had a strong, hot heart and sent up a
pillar of flame thirty or forty feet high, illuminating a wide circle
in spite of the rain, and casting a red glare into the flying clouds.
Of all the thousands of camp-fires I have elsewhere built none was just
like this one, rejoicing in triumphant strength and beauty in the heart
of the rain-laden gale. It was wonderful,â€”the illumined rain and clouds
mingled together and the trees glowing against the jet background, the
colors of the mossy, lichened trunks with sparkling streams pouring
down the furrows of the bark, and the gray-bearded old patriarchs
bowing low and chanting in passionate worship!

My fire was in all its glory about midnight, and, having made a bark
shed to shelter me from the rain and partially dry my clothing, I had
nothing to do but look and listen and join the trees in their hymns and
prayers.

Neither the great white heart of the fire nor the quivering
enthusiastic flames shooting aloft like auroral lances could be seen
from the village on account of the trees in front of it and its being
back a little way over the brow of the hill; but the light in the
clouds made a great show, a portentous sign in the stormy heavens
unlike anything ever before seen or heard of in Wrangell. Some wakeful
Indians, happening to see it about midnight, in great alarm aroused the
Collector of Customs and begged him to go to the missionaries and get
them to pray away the frightful omen, and inquired anxiously whether
white men had ever seen anything like that sky-fire, which instead of
being quenched by the rain was burning brighter and brighter. The
Collector said he had heard of such strange fires, and this one he
thought might perhaps be what the white man called a â€œvolcano, or an
_ignis fatuus_.â€ When Mr. Young was called from his bed to pray, he,
too, confoundedly astonished and at a loss for any sort of explanation,
confessed that he had never seen anything like it in the sky or
anywhere else in such cold wet weather, but that it was probably some
sort of spontaneous combustion â€œthat the white man called St. Elmoâ€™s
fire, or Will-of-the-wisp.â€ These explanations, though not convincingly
clear, perhaps served to veil their own astonishment and in some
measure to diminish the superstitious fears of the natives; but from
what I heard, the few whites who happened to see the strange light
wondered about as wildly as the Indians.

I have enjoyed thousands of camp-fires in all sorts of weather and
places, warm-hearted, short-flamed, friendly little beauties glowing in
the dark on open spots in high Sierra gardens, daisies and lilies
circled about them, gazing like enchanted children; and large fires in
silver fir forests, with spires of flame towering like the trees about
them, and sending up multitudes of starry sparks to enrich the sky; and
still greater fires on the mountains in winter, changing camp climate
to summer, and making the frosty snow look like beds of white flowers,
and oftentimes mingling their swarms of swift-flying sparks with
falling snow-crystals when the clouds were in bloom. But this Wrangell
camp-fire, my first in Alaska, I shall always remember for its
triumphant storm-defying grandeur, and the wondrous beauty of the
psalm-singing, lichen-painted trees which it brought to light.

Chapter III
Wrangell Island and Alaska Summers


Wrangell Island is about fourteen miles long, separated from the
mainland by a narrow channel or fiord, and trending in the direction of
the flow of the ancient ice-sheet. Like all its neighbors, it is
densely forested down to the waterâ€™s edge with trees that never seem to
have suffered from thirst or fire or the axe of the lumberman in all
their long century lives. Beneath soft, shady clouds, with abundance of
rain, they flourish in wonderful strength and beauty to a good old age,
while the many warm days, half cloudy, half clear, and the little
groups of pure sun-days enable them to ripen their cones and send
myriads of seeds flying every autumn to insure the permanence of the
forests and feed the multitude of animals.

The Wrangell village was a rough place. No mining hamlet in the placer
gulches of California, nor any backwoods village I ever saw, approached
it in picturesque, devil-may-care _abandon_. It was a lawless draggle
of wooden huts and houses, built in crooked lines, wrangling around the
boggy shore of the island for a mile or so in the general form of the
letter S, without the slightest subordination to the points of the
compass or to building laws of any kind. Stumps and logs, like precious
monuments, adorned its two streets, each stump and log, on account of
the moist climate, moss-grown and tufted with grass and bushes, but
muddy on the sides below the limit of the bog-line. The ground in
general was an oozy, mossy bog on a foundation of jagged rocks, full of
concealed pit-holes. These picturesque rock, bog, and stump
obstructions, however, were not so very much in the way, for there were
no wagons or carriages there. There was not a horse on the island. The
domestic animals were represented by chickens, a lonely cow, a few
sheep, and hogs of a breed well calculated to deepen and complicate the
mud of the streets.

Most of the permanent residents of Wrangell were engaged in trade. Some
little trade was carried on in fish and furs, but most of the
quickening business of the place was derived from the Cassiar
gold-mines, some two hundred and fifty or three hundred miles inland,
by way of the Stickeen River and Dease Lake. Two stern-wheel steamers
plied on the river between Wrangell and Telegraph Creek at the head of
navigation, a hundred and fifty miles from Wrangell, carrying freight
and passengers and connecting with pack-trains for the mines. These
placer mines, on tributaries of the Mackenzie River, were discovered in
the year 1874. About eighteen hundred miners and prospectors were said
to have passed through Wrangell that season of 1879, about half of them
being Chinamen. Nearly a third of this whole number set out from here
in the month of February, traveling on the Stickeen River, which
usually remains safely frozen until toward the end of April. The main
body of the miners, however, went up on the steamers in May and June.
On account of the severe winters they were all compelled to leave the
mines the end of September. Perhaps about two thirds of them passed the
winter in Portland and Victoria and the towns of Puget Sound. The rest
remained here in Wrangell, dozing away the long winter as best they
could.

Indians, mostly of the Stickeen tribe, occupied the two ends of the
town, the whites, of whom there were about forty or fifty, the middle
portion; but there was no determinate line of demarcation, the
dwellings of the Indians being mostly as large and solidly built of
logs and planks as those of the whites. Some of them were adorned with
tall totem poles.

The fort was a quadrangular stockade with a dozen block and frame
buildings located upon rising ground just back of the business part of
the town. It was built by our Government shortly after the purchase of
Alaska, and was abandoned in 1872, reoccupied by the military in 1875,
and finally abandoned and sold to private parties in 1877. In the fort
and about it there were a few good, clean homes, which shone all the
more brightly in their sombre surroundings. The ground occupied by the
fort, by being carefully leveled and drained, was dry, though formerly
a portion of the general swamp, showing how easily the whole town could
have been improved. But in spite of disorder and squalor, shaded with
clouds, washed and wiped by rain and sea winds, it was triumphantly
salubrious through all the seasons. And though the houses seemed to
rest uneasily among the miry rocks and stumps, squirming at all angles
as if they had been tossed and twisted by earthquake shocks, and
showing but little more relation to one another than may be observed
among moraine boulders, Wrangell was a tranquil place. I never heard a
noisy brawl in the streets, or a clap of thunder, and the waves seldom
spoke much above a whisper along the beach. In summer the rain comes
straight down, steamy and tepid. The clouds are usually united, filling
the sky, not racing along in threatening ranks suggesting energy of an
overbearing destructive kind, but forming a bland, mild, laving bath.
The cloudless days are calm, pearl-gray, and brooding in tone,
inclining to rest and peace; the islands seem to drowse and float on
the glassy water, and in the woods scarce a leaf stirs.

The very brightest of Wrangell days are not what Californians would
call bright. The tempered sunshine sifting through the moist atmosphere
makes no dazzling glare, and the town, like the landscape, rests
beneath a hazy, hushing, Indian-summerish spell. On the longest days
the sun rises about three oâ€™clock, but it is daybreak at midnight. The
cocks crowed when they woke, without reference to the dawn, for it is
never quite dark; there were only a few full-grown roosters in
Wrangell, half a dozen or so, to awaken the town and give it a
civilized character. After sunrise a few languid smoke-columns might be
seen, telling the first stir of the people. Soon an Indian or two might
be noticed here and there at the doors of their barnlike cabins, and a
merchant getting ready for trade; but scarcely a sound was heard, only
a dull, muffled stir gradually deepening. There were only two white
babies in the town, so far as I saw, and as for Indian babies, they
woke and ate and made no crying sound. Later you might hear the
croaking of ravens, and the strokes of an axe on firewood. About eight
or nine oâ€™clock the town was awake. Indians, mostly women and children,
began to gather on the front platforms of the half-dozen stores,
sitting carelessly on their blankets, every other face hideously
blackened, a naked circle around the eyes, and perhaps a spot on the
cheek-bone and the nose where the smut has been rubbed off. Some of the
little children were also blackened, and none were over-clad, their
light and airy costume consisting of a calico shirt reaching only to
the waist. Boys eight or ten years old sometimes had an additional
garment,â€”a pair of castaway minerâ€™s overalls wide enough and ragged
enough for extravagant ventilation. The larger girls and young women
were arrayed in showy calico, and wore jaunty straw hats, gorgeously
ribboned, and glowed among the blackened and blanketed old crones like
scarlet tanagers in a flock of blackbirds. The women, seated on the
steps and platform of the tradersâ€™ shops, could hardly be called
loafers, for they had berries to sell, basketfuls of huckleberries,
large yellow salmon-berries, and bog raspberries that looked wondrous
fresh and clean amid the surrounding squalor. After patiently waiting
for purchasers until hungry, they ate what they could not sell, and
went away to gather more.

Yonder you see a canoe gliding out from the shore, containing perhaps a
man, a woman, and a child or two, all paddling together in natural,
easy rhythm. They are going to catch a fish, no difficult matter, and
when this is done their dayâ€™s work is done. Another party puts out to
capture bits of driftwood, for it is easier to procure fuel in this way
than to drag it down from the outskirts of the woods through rocks and
bushes. As the day advances, a fleet of canoes may be seen along the
shore, all fashioned alike, high and long beak-like prows and sterns,
with lines as fine as those of the breast of a duck. What the mustang
is to the Mexican _vaquero_, the canoe is to these coast Indians. They
skim along the shores to fish and hunt and trade, or merely to visit
their neighbors, for they are sociable, and have family pride
remarkably well developed, meeting often to inquire after each otherâ€™s
health, attend potlatches and dances, and gossip concerning coming
marriages, births, deaths, etc. Others seem to sail for the pure
pleasure of the thing, their canoes decorated with handfuls of the tall
purple epilobium.

[Illustration: Indian Canoes.]

Yonder goes a whole family, grandparents and all, making a direct
course for some favorite stream and camp-ground. They are going to
gather berries, as the baskets tell. Never before in all my travels,
north or south, had I found so lavish an abundance of berries as here.
The woods and meadows are full of them, both on the lowlands and
mountainsâ€”huckleberries of many species, salmon-berries, blackberries,
raspberries, with service-berries on dry open places, and cranberries
in the bogs, sufficient for every bird, beast, and human being in the
territory and thousands of tons to spare. The huckleberries are
especially abundant. A species that grows well up on the mountains is
the best and largest, a half-inch and more in diameter and delicious in
flavor. These grow on bushes three or four inches to a foot high. The
berries of the commonest species are smaller and grow almost everywhere
on the low grounds on bushes from three to six or seven feet high. This
is the species on which the Indians depend most for food, gathering
them in large quantities, beating them into a paste, pressing the paste
into cakes about an inch thick, and drying them over a slow fire to
enrich their winter stores. Salmon-berries and service-berries are
preserved in the same way.

A little excursion to one of the best huckleberry fields adjacent to
Wrangell, under the direction of the Collector of Customs, to which I
was invited, I greatly enjoyed. There were nine Indians in the party,
mostly women and children going to gather huckleberries. As soon as we
had arrived at the chosen campground on the bank of a trout stream, all
ran into the bushes and began eating berries before anything in the way
of camp-making was done, laughing and chattering in natural animal
enjoyment. The Collector went up the stream to examine a meadow at its
head with reference to the quantity of hay it might yield for his cow,
fishing by the way. All the Indians except the two eldest boys who
joined the Collector, remained among the berries.

The fishermen had rather poor luck, owing, they said, to the sunny
brightness of the day, a complaint seldom heard in this climate. They
got good exercise, however, jumping from boulder to boulder in the
brawling stream, running along slippery logs and through the bushes
that fringe the bank, casting here and there into swirling pools at the
foot of cascades, imitating the tempting little skips and whirls of
flies so well known to fishing parsons, but perhaps still better known
to Indian boys. At the lake-basin the Collector, after he had surveyed
his hay-meadow, went around it to the inlet of the lake with his brown
pair of attendants to try their luck, while I botanized in the
delightful flora which called to mind the cool sphagnum and carex bogs
of Wisconsin and Canada. Here I found many of my old favorites the
heathwortsâ€”kalmia, pyrola, chiogenes, huckleberry, cranberry, etc. On
the margin of the meadow darling linnÃ¦a was in its glory; purple
panicled grasses in full flower reached over my head, and some of the
carices and ferns were almost as tall. Here, too, on the edge of the
woods I found the wild apple tree, the first I had seen in Alaska. The
Indians gather the fruit, small and sour as it is, to flavor their fat
salmon. I never saw a richer bog and meadow growth anywhere. The
principal forest-trees are hemlock, spruce, and Nootka cypress, with a
few pines (_P. contorta_) on the margin of the meadow, some of them
nearly a hundred feet high, draped with gray usnea, the bark also gray
with scale lichens.

We met all the berry-pickers at the lake, excepting only a small girl
and the camp-keeper. In their bright colors they made a lively picture
among the quivering bushes, keeping up a low pleasant chanting as if
the day and the place and the berries were according to their own
hearts. The children carried small baskets, holding two or three
quarts; the women two large ones swung over their shoulders. In the
afternoon, when the baskets were full, all started back to the
camp-ground, where the canoe was left. We parted at the lake, I
choosing to follow quietly the stream through the woods. I was the
first to arrive at camp. The rest of the party came in shortly
afterwards, singing and humming like heavy-laden bees. It was
interesting to note how kindly they held out handfuls of the best
berries to the little girl, who welcomed them all in succession with
smiles and merry words that I did not understand. But there was no
mistaking the kindliness and serene good nature.

While I was at Wrangell the chiefs and head men of the Stickeen tribe
got up a grand dinner and entertainment in honor of their distinguished
visitors, three doctors of divinity and their wives, fellow passengers
on the steamer with me, whose object was to organize the Presbyterian
church. To both the dinner and dances I was invited, was adopted by the
Stickeen tribe, and given an Indian name (Ancoutahan) said to mean
adopted chief. I was inclined to regard this honor as being unlikely to
have any practical value, but I was assured by Mr. Vanderbilt, Mr.
Young, and others that it would be a great safeguard while I was on my
travels among the different tribes of the archipelago. For travelers
without an Indian name might be killed and robbed without the offender
being called to account as long as the crime was kept secret from the
whites; but, being adopted by the Stickeens, no one belonging to the
other tribes would dare attack me, knowing that the Stickeens would
hold them responsible.

The dinner-tables were tastefully decorated with flowers, and the food
and general arrangements were in good taste, but there was no trace of
Indian dishes. It was mostly imported canned stuff served Boston
fashion. After the dinner we assembled in Chief Shakesâ€™s large
block-house and were entertained with lively examples of their dances
and amusements, carried on with great spirit, making a very novel
barbarous durbar. The dances seemed to me wonderfully like those of the
American Indians in general, a monotonous stamping accompanied by
hand-clapping, head-jerking, and explosive grunts kept in time to grim
drum-beats. The chief dancer and leader scattered great quantities of
downy feathers like a snowstorm as blessings on everybody, while all
chanted, â€œHee-ee-ah-ah, hee-ee-ah-ah,â€ jumping up and down until all
were bathed in perspiration.

After the dancing excellent imitations were given of the gait,
gestures, and behavior of several animals under different
circumstancesâ€”walking, hunting, capturing, and devouring their prey,
etc. While all were quietly seated, waiting to see what next was going
to happen, the door of the big house was suddenly thrown open and in
bounced a bear, so true to life in form and gestures we were all
startled, though it was only a bear-skin nicely fitted on a man who was
intimately acquainted with the animals and knew how to imitate them.
The bear shuffled down into the middle of the floor and made the motion
of jumping into a stream and catching a wooden salmon that was ready
for him, carrying it out on to the bank, throwing his head around to
listen and see if any one was coming, then tearing it to pieces,
jerking his head from side to side, looking and listening in fear of
huntersâ€™ rifles. Besides the bear dance, there were porpoise and deer
dances with one of the party imitating the animals by stuffed specimens
with an Indian inside, and the movements were so accurately imitated
that they seemed the real thing.

These animal plays were followed by serious speeches, interpreted by an
Indian woman: â€œDear Brothers and Sisters, this is the way we used to
dance. We liked it long ago when we were blind, we always danced this
way, but now we are not blind. The Good Lord has taken pity upon us and
sent his son, Jesus Christ, to tell us what to do. We have danced
to-day only to show you how blind we were to like to dance in this
foolish way. We will not dance any more.â€

Another speech was interpreted as follows: â€œâ€˜Dear Brothers and
Sisters,â€™ the chief says, â€˜this is else way we used to dance and play.
We do not wish to do so any more. We will give away all the dance
dresses you have seen us wearing, though we value them very highly.â€™ He
says he feels much honored to have so many white brothers and sisters
at our dinner and plays.â€

Several short explanatory remarks were made all through the exercises
by Chief Shakes, presiding with grave dignity. The last of his speeches
concluded thus: â€œDear Brothers and Sisters, we have been long, long in
the dark. You have led us into strong guiding light and taught us the
right way to live and the right way to die. I thank you for myself and
all my people, and I give you my heart.â€

At the close of the amusements there was a potlatch when robes made of
the skins of deer, wild sheep, marmots, and sables were distributed,
and many of the fantastic head-dresses that had been worn by Shamans.
One of these fell to my share.

The floor of the house was strewn with fresh hemlock boughs, bunches of
showy wild flowers adorned the walls, and the hearth was filled with
huckleberry branches and epilobium. Altogether it was a wonderful show.

I have found southeastern Alaska a good, healthy country to live in.
The climate of the islands and shores of the mainland is remarkably
bland and temperate and free from extremes of either heat or cold
throughout the year. It is rainy, however,â€”so much so that hay-making
will hardly ever be extensively engaged in here, whatever the future
may show in the way of the development of mines, forests, and
fisheries. This rainy weather, however, is of good quality, the best of
the kind I ever experienced, mild in temperature, mostly gentle in its
fall, filling the fountains of the rivers and keeping the whole land
fresh and fruitful, while anything more delightful than the shining
weather in the midst of the rain, the great round sun-days of July and
August, may hardly be found anywhere, north or south. An Alaska summer
day is a day without night. In the Far North, at Point Barrow, the sun
does not set for weeks, and even here in southeastern Alaska it is only
a few degrees below the horizon at its lowest point, and the topmost
colors of the sunset blend with those of the sunrise, leaving no gap of
darkness between. Midnight is only a low noon, the middle point of the
gloaming. The thin clouds that are almost always present are then
colored yellow and red, making a striking advertisement of the sunâ€™s
progress beneath the horizon. The day opens slowly. The low arc of
light steals around to the northeastward with gradual increase of
height and span and intensity of tone; and when at length the sun
appears, it is without much of that stirring, impressive pomp, of
flashing, awakening, triumphant energy, suggestive of the Bible
imagery, a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoicing like a
strong man to run a race. The red clouds with yellow edges dissolve in
hazy dimness; the islands, with grayish-white ruffs of mist about them,
cast ill-defined shadows on the glistening waters, and the whole
down-bending firmament becomes pearl-gray. For three or four hours
after sunrise there is nothing especially impressive in the landscape.
The sun, though seemingly unclouded, may almost be looked in the face,
and the islands and mountains, with their wealth of woods and snow and
varied beauty of architecture, seem comparatively sleepy and
uncommunicative.

As the day advances toward high noon, the sun-flood streaming through
the damp atmosphere lights the water levels and the sky to glowing
silver. Brightly play the ripples about the bushy edges of the islands
and on the plume-shaped streaks between them, ruffled by gentle passing
wind-currents. The warm air throbs and makes itself felt as a
life-giving, energizing ocean, embracing all the landscape, quickening
the imagination, and bringing to mind the life and motion about usâ€”the
tides, the rivers, the flood of light streaming through the satiny sky;
the marvelous abundance of fishes feeding in the lower ocean; the misty
flocks of insects in the air; wild sheep and goats on a thousand grassy
ridges; beaver and mink far back on many a rushing stream; Indians
floating and basking along the shores; leaves and crystals drinking the
sunbeams; and glaciers on the mountains, making valleys and basins for
new rivers and lakes and fertile beds of soil.

Through the afternoon, all the way down to the sunset, the day grows in
beauty. The light seems to thicken and become yet more generously
fruitful without losing its soft mellow brightness. Everything seems to
settle into conscious repose. The winds breathe gently or are wholly at
rest. The few clouds visible are downy and luminous and combed out fine
on the edges. Gulls here and there, winnowing the air on easy wing, are
brought into striking relief; and every stroke of the paddles of Indian
hunters in their canoes is told by a quick, glancing flash. Bird choirs
in the grove are scarce heard as they sweeten the brooding stillness;
and the sky, land, and water meet and blend in one inseparable scene of
enchantment. Then comes the sunset with its purple and gold, not a
narrow arch on the horizon, but oftentimes filling all the sky. The
level cloud-bars usually present are fired on the edges, and the spaces
of clear sky between them are greenish-yellow or pale amber, while the
orderly flocks of small overlapping clouds, often seen higher up, are
mostly touched with crimson like the out-leaning sprays of maple-groves
in the beginning of an Eastern Indian Summer. Soft, mellow purple
flushes the sky to the zenith and fills the air, fairly steeping and
transfiguring the islands and making all the water look like wine.
After the sun goes down, the glowing gold vanishes, but because it
descends on a curve nearly in the same plane with the horizon, the
glowing portion of the display lasts much longer than in more southern
latitudes, while the upper colors with gradually lessening intensity of
tone sweep around to the north, gradually increase to the eastward, and
unite with those of the morning.

The most extravagantly colored of all the sunsets I have yet seen in
Alaska was one I enjoyed on the voyage from Portland to Wrangell, when
we were in the midst of one of the most thickly islanded parts of the
Alexander Archipelago. The day had been showery, but late in the
afternoon the clouds melted away from the west, all save a few that
settled down in narrow level bars near the horizon. The evening was
calm and the sunset colors came on gradually, increasing in extent and
richness of tone by slow degrees as if requiring more time than usual
to ripen. At a height of about thirty degrees there was a heavy
cloud-bank, deeply reddened on its lower edge and the projecting parts
of its face. Below this were three horizontal belts of purple edged
with gold, while a vividly defined, spreading fan of flame streamed
upward across the purple bars and faded in a feather edge of dull red.
But beautiful and impressive as was this painting on the sky, the most
novel and exciting effect was in the body of the atmosphere itself,
which, laden with moisture, became one mass of colorâ€”a fine translucent
purple haze in which the islands with softened outlines seemed to
float, while a dense red ring lay around the base of each of them as a
fitting border. The peaks, too, in the distance, and the snow-fields
and glaciers and fleecy rolls of mist that lay in the hollows, were
flushed with a deep, rosy alpenglow of ineffable loveliness. Everything
near and far, even the ship, was comprehended in the glorious picture
and the general color effect. The mission divines we had aboard seemed
then to be truly divine as they gazed transfigured in the celestial
glory. So also seemed our bluff, storm-fighting old captain, and his
tarry sailors and all.

About one third of the summer days I spent in the Wrangell region were
cloudy with very little or no rain, one third decidedly rainy, and one
third clear. According to a record kept here of a hundred and
forty-seven days beginning May 17 of that year, there were sixty-five
on which rain fell, forty-three cloudy with no rain, and thirty-nine
clear. In June rain fell on eighteen days, in July eight days, in
August fifteen days, in September twenty days. But on some of these
days there was only a few minutesâ€™ rain, light showers scarce enough to
count, while as a general thing the rain fell so gently and the
temperature was so mild, very few of them could be called stormy or
dismal; even the bleakest, most bedraggled of them all usually had a
flush of late or early color to cheer them, or some white illumination
about the noon hours. I never before saw so much rain fall with so
little noise. None of the summer winds make roaring storms, and thunder
is seldom heard. I heard none at all. This wet, misty weather seems
perfectly healthful. There is no mildew in the houses, as far as I have
seen, or any tendency toward mouldiness in nooks hidden from the sun;
and neither among the people nor the plants do we find anything flabby
or dropsical.

In September clear days were rare, more than three fourths of them were
either decidedly cloudy or rainy, and the rains of this month were,
with one wild exception, only moderately heavy, and the clouds between
showers drooped and crawled in a ragged, unsettled way without
betraying hints of violence such as one often sees in the gestures of
mountain storm-clouds.

July was the brightest month of the summer, with fourteen days of
sunshine, six of them in uninterrupted succession, with a temperature
at 7 A.M. of about 60Â°, at 12 M., 70Â°. The average 7 A.M. temperature
for June was 54.3Â°; the average 7 A.M. temperature for July was 55.3Â°;
at 12 M. the average temperature was 61.45Â°; the average 7 A.M.
temperature for August was 54.12Â°; 12 M., 61.48Â°; the average 7 A.M.
temperature for September was 52.14Â°; and 12 M., 56.12Â°.

The highest temperature observed here during the summer was seventy-six
degrees. The most remarkable characteristic of this summer weather,
even the brightest of it, is the velvet softness of the atmosphere. On
the mountains of California, throughout the greater part of the year,
the presence of an atmosphere is hardly recognized, and the thin,
white, bodiless light of the morning comes to the peaks and glaciers as
a pure spiritual essence, the most impressive of all the terrestrial
manifestations of God. The clearest of Alaskan air is always
appreciably substantial, so much so that it would seem as if one might
test its quality by rubbing it between the thumb and finger. I never
before saw summer days so white and so full of subdued lustre.

The winter storms, up to the end of December when I left Wrangell, were
mostly rain at a temperature of thirty-five or forty degrees, with
strong winds which sometimes roughly lash the shores and carry scud far
into the woods. The long nights are then gloomy enough and the value of
snug homes with crackling yellow cedar fires may be finely appreciated.
Snow falls frequently, but never to any great depth or to lie long. It
is said that only once since the settlement of Fort Wrangell has the
ground been covered to a depth of four feet. The mercury seldom falls
more than five or six degrees below the freezing-point, unless the wind
blows steadily from the mainland. Back from the coast, however, beyond
the mountains, the winter months are very cold. On the Stickeen River
at Glenora, less than a thousand feet above the level of the sea, a
temperature of from thirty to forty degrees below zero is not uncommon.




Chapter IV
The Stickeen River


The most interesting of the short excursions we made from Fort Wrangell
was the one up the Stickeen River to the head of steam navigation. From
Mt. St. Elias the coast range extends in a broad, lofty chain beyond
the southern boundary of the territory, gashed by stupendous caÃ±ons,
each of which carries a lively river, though most of them are
comparatively short, as their highest sources lie in the icy solitudes
of the range within forty or fifty miles of the coast. A few, however,
of these foaming, roaring streamsâ€”the Alsek, Chilcat, Chilcoot, Taku,
Stickeen, and perhaps othersâ€”head beyond the range with some of the
southwest branches of the Mackenzie and Yukon.

The largest side branches of the main-trunk caÃ±ons of all these
mountain streams are still occupied by glaciers which descend in showy
ranks, their messy, bulging snouts lying back a little distance in the
shadows of the walls, or pushing forward among the cotton-woods that
line the banks of the rivers, or even stretching all the way across the
main caÃ±ons, compelling the rivers to find a channel beneath them.

The Stickeen was, perhaps, the best known of the rivers that cross the
Coast Range, because it was the best way to the Mackenzie River Cassiar
gold-mines. It is about three hundred and fifty miles long, and is
navigable for small steamers a hundred and fifty miles to Glenora, and
sometimes to Telegraph Creek, fifteen miles farther. It first pursues a
westerly course through grassy plains darkened here and there with
groves of spruce and pine; then, curving southward and receiving
numerous tributaries from the north, it enters the Coast Range, and
sweeps across it through a magnificent caÃ±on three thousand to five
thousand feet deep, and more than a hundred miles long. The majestic
cliffs and mountains forming the caÃ±on walls display endless variety of
form and sculpture, and are wonderfully adorned and enlivened with
glaciers and waterfalls, while throughout almost its whole extent the
floor is a flowery landscape garden, like Yosemite. The most striking
features are the glaciers, hanging over the cliffs, descending the side
caÃ±ons and pushing forward to the river, greatly enhancing the wild
beauty of all the others.

Gliding along the swift-flowing river, the views change with
bewildering rapidity. Wonderful, too, are the changes dependent on the
seasons and the weather. In spring, when the snow is melting fast, you
enjoy the countless rejoicing waterfalls; the gentle breathing of warm
winds; the colors of the young leaves and flowers when the bees are
busy and wafts of fragrance are drifting hither and thither from miles
of wild roses, clover, and honeysuckle; the swaths of birch and willow
on the lower slopes following the melting of the winter avalanche
snow-banks; the bossy cumuli swelling in white and purple piles above
the highest peaks; gray rain-clouds wreathing the outstanding brows and
battlements of the walls; and the breaking-forth of the sun after the
rain; the shining of the leaves and streams and crystal architecture of
the glaciers; the rising of fresh fragrance; the song of the happy
birds; and the serene color-grandeur of the morning and evening sky. In
summer you find the groves and gardens in full dress; glaciers melting
rapidly under sunshine and rain; waterfalls in all their glory; the
river rejoicing in its strength; young birds trying their wings; bears
enjoying salmon and berries; all the life of the caÃ±on brimming full
like the streams. In autumn comes rest, as if the yearâ€™s work were
done. The rich hazy sunshine streaming over the cliffs calls forth the
last of the gentians and goldenrods; the groves and thickets and
meadows bloom again as their leaves change to red and yellow petals;
the rocks also, and the glaciers, seem to bloom like the plants in the
mellow golden light. And so goes the song, change succeeding change in
sublime harmony through all the wonderful seasons and weather.

My first trip up the river was made in the spring with the missionary
party soon after our arrival at Wrangell. We left Wrangell in the
afternoon and anchored for the night above the river delta, and started
up the river early next morning when the heights above the â€œBig
Stickeenâ€ Glacier and the smooth domes and copings and arches of solid
snow along the tops of the caÃ±on walls were glowing in the early beams.
We arrived before noon at the old trading-post called â€œBuckâ€™sâ€ in front
of the Stickeen Glacier, and remained long enough to allow the few
passengers who wished a nearer view to cross the river to the terminal
moraine. The sunbeams streaming through the ice pinnacles along its
terminal wall produced a wonderful glory of color, and the broad,
sparkling crystal prairie and the distant snowy fountains were
wonderfully attractive and made me pray for opportunity to explore
them.

Of the many glaciers, a hundred or more, that adorn the walls of the
great Stickeen River CaÃ±on, this is the largest. It draws its sources
from snowy mountains within fifteen or twenty miles of the coast, pours
through a comparatively narrow caÃ±on about two miles in width in a
magnificent cascade, and expands in a broad fan five or six miles in
width, separated from the Stickeen River by its broad terminal moraine,
fringed with spruces and willows. Around the beautifully drawn curve of
the moraine the Stickeen River flows, having evidently been shoved by
the glacier out of its direct course. On the opposite side of the caÃ±on
another somewhat smaller glacier, which now terminates four or five
miles from the river, was once united front to front with the greater
glacier, though at first both were tributaries of the main Stickeen
Glacier which once filled the whole grand caÃ±on. After the main trunk
caÃ±on was melted out, its side branches, drawing their sources from a
height of three or four to five or six thousand feet, were cut off, and
of course became separate glaciers, occupying cirques and branch caÃ±ons
along the tops and sides of the walls. The Indians have a tradition
that the river used to run through a tunnel under the united fronts of
the two large tributary glaciers mentioned above, which entered the
main caÃ±on from either side; and that on one occasion an Indian,
anxious to get rid of his wife, had her sent adrift in a canoe down
through the ice tunnel, expecting that she would trouble him no more.
But to his surprise she floated through under the ice in safety. All
the evidence connected with the present appearance of these two
glaciers indicates that they were united and formed a dam across the
river after the smaller tributaries had been melted off and had receded
to a greater or lesser height above the valley floor.

The big Stickeen Glacier is hardly out of sight ere you come upon
another that pours a majestic crystal flood through the evergreens,
while almost every hollow and tributary caÃ±on contains a smaller one,
the size, of course, varying with the extent of the area drained. Some
are like mere snow-banks; others, with the blue ice apparent, depend in
massive bulging curves and swells, and graduate into the river-like
forms that maze through the lower forested regions and are so striking
and beautiful that they are admired even by the passing miners with
gold-dust in their eyes.

Thirty-five miles above the Big Stickeen Glacier is the â€œDirt Glacier,â€
the second in size. Its outlet is a fine stream, abounding in trout. On
the opposite side of the river there is a group of five glaciers, one
of them descending to within a hundred feet of the river.

Near Glenora, on the northeastern flank of the main Coast Range, just
below a narrow gorge called â€œThe CaÃ±on,â€ terraces first make their
appearance, where great quantities of moraine material have been swept
through the flood-choked gorge and of course outspread and deposited on
the first open levels below. Here, too, occurs a marked change in
climate and consequently in forests and general appearance of the face
of the country. On account of destructive fires the woods are younger
and are composed of smaller trees about a foot to eighteen inches in
diameter and seventy-five feet high, mostly two-leaved pines which hold
their seeds for several years after they are ripe. The woods here are
without a trace of those deep accumulations of mosses, leaves, and
decaying trunks which make so damp and unclearable mass in the coast
forests. Whole mountain-sides are covered with gray moss and lichens
where the forest has been utterly destroyed. The river-bank cottonwoods
are also smaller, and the birch and contorta pines mingle freely with
the coast hemlock and spruce. The birch is common on the lower slopes
and is very effective, its round, leafy, pale-green head contrasting
with the dark, narrow spires of the conifers and giving a striking
character to the forest. The â€œtamarac pineâ€ or black pine, as the
variety of _P. contorta_ is called here, is yellowish-green, in marked
contrast with the dark lichen-draped spruce which grows above the pine
at a height of about two thousand feet, in groves and belts where it
has escaped fire and snow avalanches. There is another handsome spruce
hereabouts, _Picea alba_, very slender and graceful in habit, drooping
at the top like a mountain hemlock. I saw fine specimens a hundred and
twenty-five feet high on deep bottom land a few miles below Glenora.
The tops of some of them were almost covered with dense clusters of
yellow and brown cones.

We reached the old Hudsonâ€™s Bay trading-post at Glenora about one
oâ€™clock, and the captain informed me that he would stop here until the
next morning, when he would make an early start for Wrangell.

At a distance of about seven or eight miles to the northeastward of the
landing, there is an outstanding group of mountains crowning a spur
from the main chain of the Coast Range, whose highest point rises about
eight thousand feet above the level of the sea; and as Glenora is only
a thousand feet above the sea, the height to be overcome in climbing
this peak is about seven thousand feet. Though the time was short I
determined to climb it, because of the advantageous position it
occupied for general views of the peaks and glaciers of the east side
of the great range.

Although it was now twenty minutes past three and the days were getting
short, I thought that by rapid climbing I could reach the summit before
sunset, in time to get a general view and a few pencil sketches, and
make my way back to the steamer in the night. Mr. Young, one of the
missionaries, asked permission to accompany me, saying that he was a
good walker and climber and would not delay me or cause any trouble. I
strongly advised him not to go, explaining that it involved a walk,
coming and going, of fourteen or sixteen miles, and a climb through
brush and boulders of seven thousand feet, a fair dayâ€™s work for a
seasoned mountaineer to be done in less than half a day and part of a
night. But he insisted that he was a strong walker, could do a
mountaineerâ€™s dayâ€™s work in half a day, and would not hinder me in any
way.

â€œWell, I have warned you,â€ I said, â€œand will not assume responsibility
for any trouble that may arise.â€

He proved to be a stout walker, and we made rapid progress across a
brushy timbered flat and up the mountain slopes, open in some places,
and in others thatched with dwarf firs, resting a minute here and there
to refresh ourselves with huckleberries, which grew in abundance in
open spots. About half an hour before sunset, when we were near a
cluster of crumbling pinnacles that formed the summit, I had ceased to
feel anxiety about the mountaineering strength and skill of my
companion, and pushed rapidly on. In passing around the shoulder of the
highest pinnacle, where the rock was rapidly disintegrating and the
danger of slipping was great, I shouted in a warning voice, â€œBe very
careful here, this is dangerous.â€

Mr. Young was perhaps a dozen or two yards behind me, but out of sight.
I afterwards reproached myself for not stopping and lending him a
steadying hand, and showing him the slight footsteps I had made by
kicking out little blocks of the crumbling surface, instead of simply
warning him to be careful. Only a few seconds after giving this
warning, I was startled by a scream for help, and hurrying back, found
the missionary face downward, his arms outstretched, clutching little
crumbling knobs on the brink of a gully that plunges down a thousand
feet or more to a small residual glacier. I managed to get below him,
touched one of his feet, and tried to encourage him by saying, â€œI am
below you. You are in no danger. You canâ€™t slip past me and I will soon
get you out of this.â€

He then told me that both of his arms were dislocated. It was almost
impossible to find available footholds on the treacherous rock, and I
was at my witsâ€™ end to know how to get him rolled or dragged to a place
where I could get about him, find out how much he was hurt, and a way
back down the mountain. After narrowly scanning the cliff and making
footholds, I managed to roll and lift him a few yards to a place where
the slope was less steep, and there I attempted to set his arms. I
found, however, that this was impossible in such a place. I therefore
tied his arms to his sides with my suspenders and necktie, to prevent
as much as possible inflammation from movement. I then left him,
telling him to lie still, that I would be back in a few minutes, and
that he was now safe from slipping. I hastily examined the ground and
saw no way of getting him down except by the steep glacier gully. After
scrambling to an outstanding point that commands a view of it from top
to bottom, to make sure that it was not interrupted by sheer
precipices, I concluded that with great care and the digging of slight
footholds he could be slid down to the glacier, where I could lay him
on his back and perhaps be able to set his arms. Accordingly, I cheered
him up, telling him I had found a way, but that it would require lots
of time and patience. Digging a footstep in the sand or crumbling rock
five or six feet beneath him, I reached up, took hold of him by one of
his feet, and gently slid him down on his back, placed his heels in the
step, then descended another five or six feet, dug heel notches, and
slid him down to them. Thus the whole distance was made by a succession
of narrow steps at very short intervals, and the glacier was reached
perhaps about midnight. Here I took off one of my boots, tied a
handkerchief around his wrist for a good hold, placed my heel in his
arm pit, and succeeded in getting one of his arms into place, but my
utmost strength was insufficient to reduce the dislocation of the
other. I therefore bound it closely to his side, and asked him if in
his exhausted and trembling condition he was still able to walk.

â€œYes,â€ he bravely replied.

So, with a steadying arm around him and many stops for rest, I marched
him slowly down in the starlight on the comparatively smooth, unassured
surface of the little glacier to the terminal moraine, a distance of
perhaps a mile, crossed the moraine, bathed his head at one of the
outlet streams, and after many rests reached a dry place and made a
brush fire. I then went ahead looking for an open way through the
bushes to where larger wood could be had, made a good lasting fire of
resiny silver-fir roots, and a leafy bed beside it. I now told him I
would run down the mountain, hasten back with help from the boat, and
carry him down in comfort. But he would not hear of my leaving him.

â€œNo, no,â€ he said, â€œI can walk down. Donâ€™t leave me.â€

I reminded him of the roughness of the way, his nerve-shaken condition,
and assured him I would not be gone long. But he insisted on trying,
saying on no account whatever must I leave him. I therefore concluded
to try to get him to the ship by short walks from one fire and
resting-place to another. While he was resting I went ahead, looking
for the best way through the brush and rocks, then returning, got him
on his feet and made him lean on my shoulder while I steadied him to
prevent his falling. This slow, staggering struggle from fire to fire
lasted until long after sunrise. When at last we reached the ship and
stood at the foot of the narrow single plank without side rails that
reached from the bank to the deck at a considerable angle, I briefly
explained to Mr. Youngâ€™s companions, who stood looking down at us, that
he had been hurt in an accident, and requested one of them to assist me
in getting him aboard. But strange to say, instead of coming down to
help, they made haste to reproach him for having gone on a â€œwild-goose
chaseâ€ with Muir.

â€œThese foolish adventures are well enough for Mr. Muir,â€ they said,
â€œbut you, Mr. Young, have a work to do; you have a family; you have a
church, and you have no right to risk your life on treacherous peaks
and precipices.â€

The captain, Nat Lane, son of Senator Joseph Lane, had been swearing in
angry impatience for being compelled to make so late a start and thus
encounter a dangerous wind in a narrow gorge, and was threatening to
put the missionaries ashore to seek their lost companion, while he went
on down the river about his business. But when he heard my call for
help, he hastened forward, and elbowed the divines away from the end of
the gangplank, shouting in angry irreverence, â€œOh, blank! This is no
time for preaching! Donâ€™t you see the man is hurt?â€

He ran down to our help, and while I steadied my trembling companion
from behind, the captain kindly led him up the plank into the saloon,
and made him drink a large glass of brandy. Then, with a man holding
down his shoulders, we succeeded in getting the bone into its socket,
notwithstanding the inflammation and contraction of the muscles and
ligaments. Mr. Young was then put to bed, and he slept all the way back
to Wrangell.

In his mission lectures in the East, Mr. Young oftentimes told this
story. I made no record of it in my notebook and never intended to
write a word about it; but after a miserable, sensational caricature of
the story had appeared in a respectable magazine, I thought it but fair
to my brave companion that it should be told just as it happened.




Chapter V
A Cruise in the Cassiar


Shortly after our return to Wrangell the missionaries planned a grand
mission excursion up the coast of the mainland to the Chilcat country,
which I gladly joined, together with Mr. Vanderbilt, his wife, and a
friend from Oregon. The river steamer Cassiar was chartered, and we had
her all to ourselves, ship and officers at our command to sail and stop
where and when we would, and of course everybody felt important and
hopeful. The main object of the missionaries was to ascertain the
spiritual wants of the warlike Chilcat tribe, with a view to the
establishment of a church and school in their principal village; the
merchant and his party were bent on business and scenery; while my mind
was on the mountains, glaciers, and forests.

This was toward the end of July, in the very brightest and best of
Alaska summer weather, when the icy mountains towering in the pearly
sky were displayed in all their glory, and the islands at their feet
seemed to float and drowse on the shining mirror waters.

After we had passed through the Wrangell Narrows, the mountains of the
mainland came in full view, gloriously arrayed in snow and ice, some of
the largest and most river-like of the glaciers flowing through wide,
high-walled valleys like Yosemite, their sources far back and
concealed, others in plain sight, from their highest fountains to the
level of the sea.

Cares of every kind were quickly forgotten, and though the Cassiar
engines soon began to wheeze and sigh with doleful solemnity,
suggesting coming trouble, we were too happy to mind them. Every face
glowed with natural love of wild beauty. The islands were seen in long
perspective, their forests dark green in the foreground, with varying
tones of blue growing more and more tender in the distance; bays full
of hazy shadows, graduating into open, silvery fields of light, and
lofty headlands with fine arching insteps dipping their feet in the
shining water. But every eye was turned to the mountains. Forgotten now
were the Chilcats and missions while the word of God was being read in
these majestic hieroglyphics blazoned along the sky. The earnest,
childish wonderment with which this glorious page of Natureâ€™s Bible was
contemplated was delightful to see. All evinced eager desire to learn.

â€œIs that a glacier,â€ they asked, â€œdown in that caÃ±on? And is it all
solid ice?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œHow deep is it?â€

â€œPerhaps five hundred or a thousand feet.â€

â€œYou say it flows. How can hard ice flow?â€

â€œIt flows like water, though invisibly slow.â€

â€œAnd where does it come from?â€

â€œFrom snow that is heaped up every winter on the mountains.â€

â€œAnd how, then, is the snow changed into ice?â€

â€œIt is welded by the pressure of its own weight.â€

â€œAre these white masses we see in the hollows glaciers also?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œAre those bluish draggled masses hanging down from beneath the
snow-fields what you call the snouts of the glaciers?â€

â€œYes.â€

â€œWhat made the hollows they are in?â€

â€œThe glaciers themselves, just as traveling animals make their own
tracks.â€

â€œHow long have they been there?â€

â€œNumberless centuries,â€ etc. I answered as best I could, keeping up a
running commentary on the subject in general, while busily engaged in
sketching and noting my own observations, preaching glacial gospel in a
rambling way, while the Cassiar, slowly wheezing and creeping along the
shore, shifted our position so that the icy caÃ±ons were opened to view
and closed again in regular succession, like the leaves of a book.

About the middle of the afternoon we were directly opposite a noble
group of glaciers some ten in number, flowing from a chain of
crater-like snow fountains, guarded around their summits and well down
their sides by jagged peaks and cols and curving mural ridges. From
each of the larger clusters of fountains, a wide, sheer-walled caÃ±on
opens down to the sea. Three of the trunk glaciers descend to within a
few feet of the sea-level. The largest of the three, probably about
fifteen miles long, terminates in a magnificent valley like Yosemite,
in an imposing wall of ice about two miles long, and from three to five
hundred feet high, forming a barrier across the valley from wall to
wall. It was to this glacier that the ships of the Alaska Ice Company
resorted for the ice they carried to San Francisco and the Sandwich
Islands, and, I believe, also to China and Japan. To load, they had
only to sail up the fiord within a short distance of the front and drop
anchor in the terminal moraine.

Another glacier, a few miles to the south of this one, receives two
large tributaries about equal in size, and then flows down a forested
valley to within a hundred feet or so of sea-level. The third of this
low-descending group is four or five miles farther south, and, though
less imposing than either of the two sketched above, is still a truly
noble object, even as imperfectly seen from the channel, and would of
itself be well worth a visit to Alaska to any lowlander so unfortunate
as never to have seen a glacier.

The boilers of our little steamer were not made for sea water, but it
was hoped that fresh water would be found at available points along our
course where streams leap down the cliffs. In this particular we
failed, however, and were compelled to use salt water an hour or two
before reaching Cape Fanshawe, the supply of fifty tons of fresh water
brought from Wrangell having then given out. To make matters worse, the
captain and engineer were not in accord concerning the working of the
engines. The captain repeatedly called for more steam, which the
engineer refused to furnish, cautiously keeping the pressure low
because the salt water foamed in the boilers and some of it passed over
into the cylinders, causing heavy thumping at the end of each piston
stroke, and threatening to knock out the cylinder-heads. At seven
oâ€™clock in the evening we had made only about seventy miles, which
caused dissatisfaction, especially among the divines, who thereupon
called a meeting in the cabin to consider what had better be done. In
the discussions that followed much indignation and economy were brought
to light. We had chartered the boat for sixty dollars per day, and the
round trip was to have been made in four or five days. But at the
present rate of speed it was found that the cost of the trip for each
passenger would be five or ten dollars above the first estimate.
Therefore, the majority ruled that we must return next day to Wrangell,
the extra dollars outweighing the mountains and missions as if they had
suddenly become dust in the balance.

Soon after the close of this economical meeting, we came to anchor in a
beautiful bay, and as the long northern day had still hours of good
light to offer, I gladly embraced the opportunity to go ashore to see
the rocks and plants. One of the Indians, employed as a deck hand on
the steamer, landed me at the mouth of a stream. The tide was low,
exposing a luxuriant growth of algÃ¦, which sent up a fine, fresh sea
smell. The shingle was composed of slate, quartz, and granite, named in
the order of abundance. The first land plant met was a tall grass, nine
feet high, forming a meadow-like margin in front of the forest. Pushing
my way well back into the forest, I found it composed almost entirely
of spruce and two hemlocks (_Picea sitchensis, Tsuga heterophylla_ and
_T. mertensiana_) with a few specimens of yellow cypress. The ferns
were developed in remarkable beauty and sizeâ€”aspidiums, one of which is
about six feet high, a woodsia, lomaria, and several species of
polypodium. The underbrush is chiefly alder, rubus, ledum, three
species of vaccinium, and _Echinopanax horrida_, the whole about from
six to eight feet high, and in some places closely intertangled and
hard to penetrate. On the opener spots beneath the trees the ground is
covered to a depth of two or three feet with mosses of indescribable
freshness and beauty, a few dwarf conifers often planted on their rich
furred bosses, together with pyrola, coptis, and Solomonâ€™s-seal. The
tallest of the trees are about a hundred and fifty feet high, with a
diameter of about four or five feet, their branches mingling together
and making a perfect shade. As the twilight began to fall, I sat down
on the mossy instep of a spruce. Not a bush or tree was moving; every
leaf seemed hushed in brooding repose. One bird, a thrush, embroidered
the silence with cheery notes, making the solitude familiar and sweet,
while the solemn monotone of the stream sifting through the woods
seemed like the very voice of God, humanized, terrestrialized, and
entering oneâ€™s heart as to a home prepared for it. Go where we will,
all the world over, we seem to have been there before.

The stream was bridged at short intervals with picturesque,
moss-embossed logs, and the trees on its banks, leaning over from side
to side, made high embowering arches. The log bridge I crossed was, I
think, the most beautiful of the kind I ever saw. The massive log is
plushed to a depth of six inches or more with mosses of three or four
species, their different tones of yellow shading finely into each
other, while their delicate fronded branches and foliage lie in
exquisite order, inclining outward and down the sides in rich, furred,
clasping sheets overlapping and felted together until the required
thickness is attained. The pedicels and spore-cases give a purplish
tinge, and the whole bridge is enriched with ferns and a row of small
seedling trees and currant bushes with colored leaves, every one of
which seems to have been culled from the woods for this special use, so
perfectly do they harmonize in size, shape, and color with the mossy
cover, the width of the span, and the luxuriant, brushy abutments.

Sauntering back to the beach, I found four or five Indian deck hands
getting water, with whom I returned aboard the steamer, thanking the
Lord for so noble an addition to my life as was this one big mountain,
forest, and glacial day.

[Illustration: Alaskan Hemlocks and Spruces, Sitka.]

Next morning most of the company seemed uncomfortably
conscience-stricken, and ready to do anything in the way of
compensation for our broken excursion that would not cost too much. It
was not found difficult, therefore, to convince the captain and
disappointed passengers that instead of creeping back to Wrangell
direct we should make an expiatory branch-excursion to the largest of
the three low-descending glaciers we had passed. The Indian pilot, well
acquainted with this part of the coast, declared himself willing to
guide us. The water in these fiord channels is generally deep and safe,
and though at wide intervals rocks rise abruptly here and there,
lacking only a few feet in height to enable them to take rank as
islands, the flat-bottomed Cassiar drew but little more water than a
duck, so that even the most timid raised no objection on this score.
The cylinder-heads of our engines were the main source of anxiety;
provided they could be kept on all might yet be well. But in this
matter there was evidently some distrust, the engineer having
imprudently informed some of the passengers that in consequence of
using salt water in his frothing boilers the cylinder-heads might fly
off at any moment. To the glacier, however, it was at length decided we
should venture.

Arriving opposite the mouth of its fiord, we steered straight inland
between beautiful wooded shores, and the grand glacier came in sight in
its granite valley, glowing in the early sunshine and extending a noble
invitation to come and see. After we passed between the two mountain
rocks that guard the gate of the fiord, the view that was unfolded
fixed every eye in wondering admiration. No words can convey anything
like an adequate conception of its sublime grandeurâ€”the noble
simplicity and fineness of the sculpture of the walls; their
magnificent proportions; their cascades, gardens, and forest
adornments; the placid fiord between them; the great white and blue ice
wall, and the snow-laden mountains beyond. Still more impotent are
words in telling the peculiar awe one experiences in entering these
mansions of the icy North, notwithstanding it is only the natural
effect of appreciable manifestations of the presence of God.

Standing in the gateway of this glorious temple, and regarding it only
as a picture, its outlines may be easily traced, the water foreground
of a pale-green color, a smooth mirror sheet sweeping back five or six
miles like one of the lower reaches of a great river, bounded at the
head by a beveled barrier wall of blueish-white ice four or five
hundred feet high. A few snowy mountain-tops appear beyond it, and on
either hand rise a series of majestic, pale-gray granite rocks from
three to four thousand feet high, some of them thinly forested and
striped with bushes and flowery grass on narrow shelves, especially
about half way up, others severely sheer and bare and built together
into walls like those of Yosemite, extending far beyond the ice
barrier, one immense brow appearing beyond another with their bases
buried in the glacier. This is a Yosemite Valley in process of
formation, the modeling and sculpture of the walls nearly completed and
well planted, but no groves as yet or gardens or meadows on the raw and
unfinished bottom. It is as if the explorer, in entering the Merced
Yosemite, should find the walls nearly in their present condition,
trees and flowers in the warm nooks and along the sunny portions of the
moraine-covered brows, but the bottom of the valley still covered with
water and beds of gravel and mud, and the grand glacier that formed it
slowly receding but still filling the upper half of the valley.

Sailing directly up to the edge of the low, outspread, water-washed
terminal moraine, scarce noticeable in a general view, we seemed to be
separated from the glacier only by a bed of gravel a hundred yards or
so in width; but on so grand a scale are all the main features of the
valley, we afterwards found the distance to be a mile or more.

The captain ordered the Indian deck hands to get out the canoe, take as
many of us ashore as wished to go, and accompany us to the glacier in
case we should need their help. Only three of the company, in the first
place, availed themselves of this rare opportunity of meeting a glacier
in the flesh,â€”Mr. Young, one of the doctors, and myself. Paddling to
the nearest and driest-looking part of the moraine flat, we stepped
ashore, but gladly wallowed back into the canoe; for the gray mineral
mud, a paste made of fine-ground mountain meal kept unstable by the
tides, at once began to take us in, swallowing us feet foremost with
becoming glacial deliberation. Our next attempt, made nearer the middle
of the valley, was successful, and we soon found ourselves on firm
gravelly ground, and made haste to the huge ice wall, which seemed to
recede as we advanced. The only difficulty we met was a network of icy
streams, at the largest of which we halted, not willing to get wet in
fording. The Indian attendant promptly carried us over on his back.
When my turn came I told him I would ford, but he bowed his shoulders
in so ludicrously persuasive a manner I thought I would try the queer
mount, the only one of the kind I had enjoyed since boyhood days in
playing leapfrog. Away staggered my perpendicular mule over the
boulders into the brawling torrent, and in spite of top-heavy
predictions to the contrary, crossed without a fall. After being
ferried in this way over several more of these glacial streams, we at
length reached the foot of the glacier wall. The doctor simply played
tag on it, touched it gently as if it were a dangerous wild beast, and
hurried back to the boat, taking the portage Indian with him for
safety, little knowing what he was missing. Mr. Young and I traced the
glorious crystal wall, admiring its wonderful architecture, the play of
light in the rifts and caverns, and the structure of the ice as
displayed in the less fractured sections, finding fresh beauty
everywhere and facts for study. We then tried to climb it, and by dint
of patient zigzagging and doubling among the crevasses, and cutting
steps here and there, we made our way up over the brow and back a mile
or two to a height of about seven hundred feet. The whole front of the
glacier is gashed and sculptured into a maze of shallow caves and
crevasses, and a bewildering variety of novel architectural forms,
clusters of glittering lance-tipped spires, gables, and obelisks, bold
outstanding bastions and plain mural cliffs, adorned along the top with
fretted cornice and battlement, while every gorge and crevasse, groove
and hollow, was filled with light, shimmering and throbbing in
pale-blue tones of ineffable tenderness and beauty. The day was warm,
and back on the broad melting bosom of the glacier beyond the crevassed
front, many streams were rejoicing, gurgling, ringing, singing, in
frictionless channels worn down through the white disintegrated ice of
the surface into the quick and living blue, in which they flowed with a
grace of motion and flashing of light to be found only on the crystal
hillocks and ravines of a glacier.

Along the sides of the glacier we saw the mighty flood grinding against
the granite walls with tremendous pressure, rounding outswelling
bosses, and deepening the retreating hollows into the forms they are
destined to have when, in the fullness of appointed time, the huge ice
tool shall be withdrawn by the sun. Every feature glowed with
intention, reflecting the plans of God. Back a few miles from the
front, the glacier is now probably but little more than a thousand feet
deep; but when we examine the records on the walls, the rounded,
grooved, striated, and polished features so surely glacial, we learn
that in the earlier days of the ice age they were all over-swept, and
that this glacier has flowed at a height of from three to four thousand
feet above its present level, when it was at least a mile deep.

Standing here, with facts so fresh and telling and held up so vividly
before us, every seeing observer, not to say geologist, must readily
apprehend the earth-sculpturing, landscape-making action of flowing
ice. And here, too, one learns that the world, though made, is yet
being made; that this is still the morning of creation; that mountains
long conceived are now being born, channels traced for coming rivers,
basins hollowed for lakes; that moraine soil is being ground and
outspread for coming plants,â€”coarse boulders and gravel for forests,
finer soil for grasses and flowers,â€”while the finest part of the grist,
seen hastening out to sea in the draining streams, is being stored away
in darkness and builded particle on particle, cementing and
crystallizing, to make the mountains and valleys and plains of other
predestined landscapes, to be followed by still others in endless
rhythm and beauty.

Gladly would we have camped out on this grand old landscape mill to
study its ways and works; but we had no bread and the captain was
keeping the Cassiar whistle screaming for our return. Therefore, in
mean haste, we threaded our way back through the crevasses and down the
blue cliffs, snatched a few flowers from a warm spot on the edge of the
ice, plashed across the moraine streams, and were paddled aboard,
rejoicing in the possession of so blessed a day, and feeling that in
very foundational truth we had been in one of Godâ€™s own temples and had
seen Him and heard Him working and preaching like a man.

Steaming solemnly out of the fiord and down the coast, the islands and
mountains were again passed in review; the clouds that so often hide
the mountain-tops even in good weather were now floating high above
them, and the transparent shadows they cast were scarce perceptible on
the white glacier fountains. So abundant and novel are the objects of
interest in a pure wilderness that unless you are pursuing special
studies it matters little where you go, or how often to the same place.
Wherever you chance to be always seems at the moment of all places the
best; and you feel that there can be no happiness in this world or in
any other for those who may not be happy here. The bright hours were
spent in making notes and sketches and getting more of the wonderful
region into memory. In particular a second view of the mountains made
me raise my first estimate of their height. Some of them must be seven
or eight thousand feet at the least. Also the glaciers seemed larger
and more numerous. I counted nearly a hundred, large and small, between
a point ten or fifteen miles to the north of Cape Fanshawe and the
mouth of the Stickeen River. We made no more landings, however, until
we had passed through the Wrangell Narrows and dropped anchor for the
night in a small sequestered bay. This was about sunset, and I eagerly
seized the opportunity to go ashore in the canoe and see what I could
learn. It is here only a step from the marine algÃ¦ to terrestrial
vegetation of almost tropical luxuriance. Parting the alders and
huckleberry bushes and the crooked stems of the prickly panax, I made
my way into the woods, and lingered in the twilight doing nothing in
particular, only measuring a few of the trees, listening to learn what
birds and animals might be about, and gazing along the dusky aisles.

In the mean time another excursion was being invented, one of small
size and price. We might have reached Fort Wrangell this evening
instead of anchoring here; but the owners of the Cassiar would then
receive only ten dollars fare from each person, while they had incurred
considerable expense in fitting up the boat for this special trip, and
had treated us well. No, under the circumstances, it would never do to
return to Wrangell so meanly soon.

It was decided, therefore, that the Cassiar Company should have the
benefit of another dayâ€™s hire, in visiting the old deserted Stickeen
village fourteen miles to the south of Wrangell.

â€œWe shall have a good time,â€ one of the most influential of the party
said to me in a semi-apologetic tone, as if dimly recognizing my
disappointment in not going on to Chilcat. â€œWe shall probably find
stone axes and other curiosities. Chief Kadachan is going to guide us,
and the other Indians aboard will dig for us, and there are interesting
old buildings and totem poles to be seen.â€

It seemed strange, however, that so important a mission to the most
influential of the Alaskan tribes should end in a deserted village. But
divinity abounded nevertheless; the day was divine and there was plenty
of natural religion in the newborn landscapes that were being baptized
in sunshine, and sermons in the glacial boulders on the beach where we
landed.

The site of the old village is on an outswelling strip of ground about
two hundred yards long and fifty wide, sloping gently to the water with
a strip of gravel and tall grass in front, dark woods back of it, and
charming views over the water among the islandsâ€”a delightful place. The
tide was low when we arrived, and I noticed that the exposed boulders
on the beachâ€”granite erratics that had been dropped by the melting ice
toward the close of the glacial periodâ€”were piled in parallel rows at
right angles to the shore-line, out of the way of the canoes that had
belonged to the village.

Most of the party sauntered along the shore; for the ruins were
overgrown with tall nettles, elder bushes, and prickly rubus vines
through which it was difficult to force a way. In company with the most
eager of the relic-seekers and two Indians, I pushed back among the
dilapidated dwellings. They were deserted some sixty or seventy years
before, and some of them were at least a hundred years old. So said our
guide, Kadachan, and his word was corroborated by the venerable aspect
of the ruins. Though the damp climate is destructive, many of the house
timbers were still in a good state of preservation, particularly those
hewn from the yellow cypress, or cedar as it is called here. The
magnitude of the ruins and the excellence of the workmanship manifest
in them was astonishing as belonging to Indians. For example, the first
dwelling we visited was about forty feet square, with walls built of
planks two feet wide and six inches thick. The ridgepole of yellow
cypress was two feet in diameter, forty feet long, and as round and
true as if it had been turned in a lathe; and, though lying in the damp
weeds, it was still perfectly sound. The nibble marks of the stone adze
were still visible, though crusted over with scale lichens in most
places. The pillars that had supported the ridgepole were still
standing in some of the ruins. They were all, as far as I observed,
carved into life-size figures of men, women, and children, fishes,
birds, and various other animals, such as the beaver, wolf, or bear.
Each of the wall planks had evidently been hewn out of a whole log, and
must have required sturdy deliberation as well as skill. Their
geometrical truthfulness was admirable. With the same tools not one in
a thousand of our skilled mechanics could do as good work. Compared
with it the bravest work of civilized backwoodsmen is feeble and
bungling. The completeness of form, finish, and proportion of these
timbers suggested skill of a wild and positive kind, like that which
guides the woodpecker in drilling round holes, and the bee in making
its cells.

[Illustration: Old Chief and Totem Pole, Wrangell.]

The carved totem-pole monuments are the most striking of the objects
displayed here. The simplest of them consisted of a smooth, round post
fifteen or twenty feet high and about eighteen inches in diameter, with
the figure of some animal on topâ€”a bear, porpoise, eagle, or raven,
about life-size or larger. These were the totems of the families that
occupied the houses in front of which they stood. Others supported the
figure of a man or woman, life-size or larger, usually in a sitting
posture, said to resemble the dead whose ashes were contained in a
closed cavity in the pole. The largest were thirty or forty feet high,
carved from top to bottom into human and animal totem figures, one
above another, with their limbs grotesquely doubled and folded. Some of
the most imposing were said to commemorate some event of an historical
character. But a telling display of family pride seemed to have been
the prevailing motive. All the figures were more or less rude, and some
were broadly grotesque, but there was never any feebleness or obscurity
in the expression. On the contrary, every feature showed grave force
and decision; while the childish audacity displayed in the designs,
combined with manly strength in their execution, was truly wonderful.

The colored lichens and mosses gave them a venerable air, while the
larger vegetation often found on such as were most decayed produced a
picturesque effect. Here, for example, is a bear five or six feet long,
reposing on top of his lichen-clad pillar, with paws comfortably
folded, a tuft of grass growing in each ear and rubus bushes along his
back. And yonder is an old chief poised on a taller pillar, apparently
gazing out over the landscape in contemplative mood, a tuft of bushes
leaning back with a jaunty air from the top of his weatherbeaten hat,
and downy mosses about his massive lips. But no rudeness or
grotesqueness that may appear, however combined with the decorations
that nature has added, may possibly provoke mirth. The whole work is
serious in aspect and brave and true in execution.

Similar monuments are made by other Thlinkit tribes. The erection of a
totem pole is made a grand affair, and is often talked of for a year or
two beforehand. A feast, to which many are invited, is held, and the
joyous occasion is spent in eating, dancing, and the distribution of
gifts. Some of the larger specimens cost a thousand dollars or more.
From one to two hundred blankets, worth three dollars apiece, are paid
to the genius who carves them, while the presents and feast usually
cost twice as much, so that only the wealthy families can afford them.
I talked with an old Indian who pointed out one of the carvings he had
made in the Wrangell village, for which he told me he had received
forty blankets, a gun, a canoe, and other articles, all together worth
about $170. Mr. Swan, who has contributed much information concerning
the British Columbian and Alaskan tribes, describes a totem pole that
cost $2500. They are always planted firmly in the ground and stand
fast, showing the sturdy erectness of their builders.

While I was busy with my pencil, I heard chopping going on at the north
end of the village, followed by a heavy thud, as if a tree had fallen.
It appeared that after digging about the old hearth in the first
dwelling visited without finding anything of consequence, the
archÃ¦ological doctor called the steamer deck hands to one of the most
interesting of the totems and directed them to cut it down, saw off the
principal figure,â€”a woman measuring three feet three inches across the
shoulders,â€”and convey it aboard the steamer, with a view to taking it
on East to enrich some museum or other. This sacrilege came near
causing trouble and would have cost us dear had the totem not chanced
to belong to the Kadachan family, the representative of which is a
member of the newly organized Wrangell Presbyterian Church. Kadachan
looked very seriously into the face of the reverend doctor and pushed
home the pertinent question: â€œHow would you like to have an Indian go
to a graveyard and break down and carry away a monument belonging to
your family?â€

However, the religious relations of the parties and a few trifling
presents embedded in apologies served to hush and mend the matter.

Some time in the afternoon the steam whistle called us together to
finish our memorable trip. There was no trace of decay in the sky; a
glorious sunset gilded the water and cleared away the shadows of our
meditations among the ruins. We landed at the Wrangell wharf at dusk,
pushed our way through a group of inquisitive Indians, across the two
crooked streets, and up to our homes in the fort. We had been away only
three days, but they were so full of novel scenes and impressions the
time seemed indefinitely long, and our broken Chilcat excursion, far
from being a failure as it seemed to some, was one of the most
memorable of my life.




Chapter VI
The Cassiar Trail


I made a second trip up the Stickeen in August and from the head of
navigation pushed inland for general views over dry grassy hills and
plains on the Cassiar trail.

Soon after leaving Telegraph Creek I met a merry trader who
encouragingly assured me that I was going into the most wonderful
region in the world, that â€œthe scenery up the river was full of the
very wildest freaks of nature, surpassing all other sceneries either
natural or artificial, on paper or in nature. And give yourself no
bothering care about provisions, for wild food grows in prodigious
abundance everywhere. A man was lost four days up there, but he feasted
on vegetables and berries and got back to camp in good condition. A
mess of wild parsnips and pepper, for example, will actually do you
good. And hereâ€™s my adviceâ€”go slow and take the pleasures and sceneries
as you go.â€

At the confluence of the first North Fork of the Stickeen I found a
band of Toltan or Stick Indians catching their winter supply of salmon
in willow traps, set where the fish are struggling in swift rapids on
their way to the spawning-grounds. A large supply had already been
secured, and of course the Indians were well fed and merry. They were
camping in large booths made of poles set on end in the ground, with
many binding cross-pieces on which tons of salmon were being dried. The
heads were strung on separate poles and the roes packed in willow
baskets, all being well smoked from fires in the middle of the floor.
The largest of the booths near the bank of the river was about forty
feet square. Beds made of spruce and pine boughs were spread all around
the walls, on which some of the Indians lay asleep; some were braiding
ropes, others sitting and lounging, gossiping and courting, while a
little baby was swinging in a hammock. All seemed to be light-hearted
and jolly, with work enough and wit enough to maintain health and
comfort. In the winter they are said to dwell in substantial huts in
the woods, where game, especially caribou, is abundant. They are pale
copper-colored, have small feet and hands, are not at all negroish in
lips or cheeks like some of the coast tribes, nor so thickset,
short-necked, or heavy-featured in general.

One of the most striking of the geological features of this region are
immense gravel deposits displayed in sections on the walls of the river
gorges. About two miles above the North Fork confluence there is a
bluff of basalt three hundred and fifty feet high, and above this a bed
of gravel four hundred feet thick, while beneath the basalt there is
another bed at least fifty feet thick.

From â€œWardâ€™s,â€ seventeen miles beyond Telegraph, and about fourteen
hundred feet above sea-level, the trail ascends a gravel ridge to a
pine-and-fir-covered plateau twenty-one hundred feet above the sea.
Thence for three miles the trail leads through a forest of short,
closely planted trees to the second North Fork of the Stickeen, where a
still greater deposit of stratified gravel is displayed, a section at
least six hundred feet thick resting on a red jaspery formation.

Nine hundred feet above the river there is a slightly dimpled plateau
diversified with aspen and willow groves and mossy meadows. At
â€œWilsonâ€™s,â€ one and a half miles from the river, the ground is carpeted
with dwarf manzanita and the blessed _LinnÃ¦a borealis_, and forested
with small pines, spruces, and aspens, the tallest fifty to sixty feet
high.

From Wilsonâ€™s to â€œCaribou,â€ fourteen miles, no water was visible,
though the nearly level, mossy ground is swampy-looking. At â€œCaribou
Camp,â€ two miles from the river, I saw two fine dogs, a Newfoundland
and a spaniel. Their owner told me that he paid only twenty dollars for
the team and was offered one hundred dollars for one of them a short
time afterwards. The Newfoundland, he said, caught salmon on the
ripples, and could be sent back for miles to fetch horses. The fine
jet-black curly spaniel helped to carry the dishes from the table to
the kitchen, went for water when ordered, took the pail and set it down
at the stream-side, but could not be taught to dip it full. But their
principal work was hauling camp-supplies on sleds up the river in
winter. These two were said to be able to haul a load of a thousand
pounds when the ice was in fairly good condition. They were fed on
dried fish and oatmeal boiled together.

The timber hereabouts is mostly willow or poplar on the low ground,
with here and there pine, birch, and spruce about fifty feet high. None
seen much exceeded a foot in diameter. Thousand-acre patches have been
destroyed by fire. Some of the green trees had been burned off at the
root, the raised roots, packed in dry moss, being readily attacked from
beneath. A range of mountains about five thousand to six thousand feet
high trending nearly north and south for sixty miles is forested to the
summit. Only a few cliff-faces and one of the highest points patched
with snow are treeless. No part of this range as far as I could see is
deeply sculptured, though the general denudation of the country must
have been enormous as the gravel-beds show.

At the top of a smooth, flowery pass about four thousand feet above the
sea, beautiful Dease Lake comes suddenly in sight, shining like a broad
tranquil river between densely forested hills and mountains. It is
about twenty-seven miles long, one to two miles wide, and its waters,
tributary to the Mackenzie, flow into the Arctic Ocean by a very long,
roundabout, romantic way, the exploration of which in 1789 from Great
Slave Lake to the Arctic Ocean must have been a glorious task for the
heroic Scotchman, Alexander Mackenzie, whose name it bears.

Dease Creek, a fine rushing stream about forty miles long and forty or
fifty feet wide, enters the lake from the west, drawing its sources
from grassy mountain-ridges. Thibert Creek, about the same size, and
McDames and Defot Creeks, with their many branches, head together in
the same general range of mountains or on moor-like tablelands on the
divide between the Mackenzie and Yukon and Stickeen. All these
Mackenzie streams had proved rich in gold. The wing-dams, flumes, and
sluice-boxes on the lower five or ten miles of their courses showed
wonderful industry, and the quantity of glacial and perhaps pre-glacial
gravel displayed was enormous. Some of the beds were not unlike those
of the so-called Dead Rivers of California. Several ancient
drift-filled channels on Thibert Creek, blue at bed rock, were exposed
and had been worked. A considerable portion of the gold, though mostly
coarse, had no doubt come from considerable distances, as boulders
included in some of the deposits show. The deepest beds, though known
to be rich, had not yet been worked to any great depth on account of
expense. Diggings that yield less than five dollars a day to the man
were considered worthless. Only three of the claims on Defot Creek,
eighteen miles from the mouth of Thibert Creek, were then said to pay.
One of the nuggets from this creek weighed forty pounds.

While wandering about the banks of these gold-besprinkled streams,
looking at the plants and mines and miners, I was so fortunate as to
meet an interesting French Canadian, an old _coureur de bois_, who
after a few minutesâ€™ conversation invited me to accompany him to his
gold-mine on the head of Defot Creek, near the summit of a smooth,
grassy mountain-ridge which he assured me commanded extensive views of
the region at the heads of Stickeen, Taku, Yukon, and Mackenzie
tributaries. Though heavy-laden with flour and bacon, he strode lightly
along the rough trails as if his load was only a natural balanced part
of his body. Our way at first lay along Thibert Creek, now on gravel
benches, now on bed rock, now close down on the bouldery edge of the
stream. Above the mines the stream is clear and flows with a rapid
current. Its banks are embossed with moss and grass and sedge well
mixed with flowersâ€”daisies, larkspurs, solidagos, parnassia,
potentilla, strawberry, etc. Small strips of meadow occur here and
there, and belts of slender arrowy fir and spruce with moss-clad roots
grow close to the waterâ€™s edge. The creek is about forty-five miles
long, and the richest of its gold-bearing beds so far discovered were
on the lower four miles of the creek; the higher
four-or-five-dollars-a-day diggings were considered very poor on
account of the high price of provisions and shortness of the season.
After crossing many smaller streams with their strips of trees and
meadows, bogs and bright wild gardens, we arrived at the Le Claire
cabin about the middle of the afternoon. Before entering it he threw
down his burden and made haste to show me his favorite flower, a blue
forget-me-not, a specimen of which he found within a few rods of the
cabin, and proudly handed it to me with the finest respect, and telling
its many charms and lifelong associations, showed in every endearing
look and touch and gesture that the tender little plant of the mountain
wilderness was truly his best-loved darling.

After luncheon we set out for the highest point on the dividing ridge
about a mile above the cabin, and sauntered and gazed until sundown,
admiring the vast expanse of open rolling prairie-like highlands dotted
with groves and lakes, the fountain-heads of countless cool, glad
streams.

Le Claireâ€™s simple, childlike love of nature, preserved undimmed
through a hard wilderness life, was delightful to see. The grand
landscapes with their lakes and streams, plants and animals, all were
dear to him. In particular he was fond of the birds that nested near
his cabin, watched the young, and in stormy weather helped their
parents to feed and shelter them. Some species were so confiding they
learned to perch on his shoulders and take crumbs from his hand.

A little before sunset snow began to fly, driven by a cold wind, and by
the time we reached the cabin, though we had not far to go, everything
looked wintry. At half-past nine we ate supper, while a good fire
crackled cheerily in the ingle and a wintry wind blew hard. The little
log cabin was only ten feet long, eight wide, and just high enough
under the roof peak to allow one to stand upright. The bedstead was not
wide enough for two, so Le Claire spread the blankets on the floor, and
we gladly lay down after our long, happy walk, our heads under the
bedstead, our feet against the opposite wall, and though comfortably
tired, it was long ere we fell asleep, for Le Claire, finding me a good
listener, told many stories of his adventurous life with Indians, bears
and wolves, snow and hunger, and of his many camps in the Canadian
woods, hidden like the nests and dens of wild animals; stories that
have a singular interest to everybody, for they awaken inherited
memories of the lang, lang syne when we were all wild. He had nine
children, he told me, the youngest eight years of age, and several of
his daughters were married. His home was in Victoria.

Next morning was cloudy and windy, snowy and cold, dreary December
weather in August, and I gladly ran out to see what I might learn. A
gray ragged-edged cloud capped the top of the divide, its snowy fringes
drawn out by the wind. The flowers, though most of them were buried or
partly so, were to some extent recognizable, the bluebells bent over,
shining like eyes through the snow, and the gentians, too, with their
corollas twisted shut; cassiope I could recognize under any disguise;
and two species of dwarf willow with their seeds already ripe, one with
comparatively small leaves, were growing in mere cracks and crevices of
rock-ledges where the dry snow could not lie. Snowbirds and ptarmigan
were flying briskly in the cold wind, and on the edge of a grove I saw
a spruce from which a bear had stripped large sections of bark for
food.

About nine oâ€™clock the clouds lifted and I enjoyed another wide view
from the summit of the ridge of the vast grassy fountain region with
smooth rolling features. A few patches of forest broke the monotony of
color, and the many lakes, one of them about five miles long, were
glowing like windows. Only the highest ridges were whitened with snow,
while rifts in the clouds showed beautiful bits of yellow-green sky.
The limit of tree growth is about five thousand feet.

Throughout all this region from Glenora to Cassiar the grasses grow
luxuriantly in openings in the woods and on dry hillsides where the
trees seem to have been destroyed by fire, and over all the broad
prairies above the timber-line. A kind of bunch-grass in particular is
often four or five feet high, and close enough to be mowed for hay. I
never anywhere saw finer or more bountiful wild pasture. Here the
caribou feed and grow fat, braving the intense winter cold, often forty
to sixty degrees below zero. Winter and summer seem to be the only
seasons here. What may fairly be called summer lasts only two or three
months, winter nine or ten, for of pure well-defined spring or autumn
there is scarcely a trace. Were it not for the long severe winters,
this would be a capital stock country, equaling Texas and the prairies
of the old West. From my outlook on the Defot ridge I saw thousands of
square miles of this prairie-like region drained by tributaries of the
Stickeen, Taku, Yukon, and Mackenzie Rivers.

Le Claire told me that the caribou, or reindeer, were very abundant on
this high ground. A flock of fifty or more was seen a short time before
at the head of Defot Creek,â€”fine, hardy, able animals like their near
relatives the reindeer of the Arctic tundras. The Indians hereabouts,
he said, hunted them with dogs, mostly in the fall and winter. On my
return trip I met several bands of these Indians on the march, going
north to hunt. Some of the men and women were carrying puppies on top
of their heavy loads of dried salmon, while the grown dogs had
saddle-bags filled with odds and ends strapped on their backs. Small
puppies, unable to carry more than five or six pounds, were thus made
useful. I overtook another band going south, heavy laden with furs and
skins to trade. An old woman, with short dress and leggings, was
carrying a big load of furs and skins, on top of which was perched a
little girl about three years old.

A brown, speckled marmot, one of Le Claireâ€™s friends, was getting ready
for winter. The entrance to his burrow was a little to one side of the
cabin door. A well-worn trail led to it through the grass and another
to that of his companion, fifty feet away. He was a most amusing pet,
always on hand at meal times for bread-crumbs and bits of bacon-rind,
came when called, answering in a shrill whistle, moving like a squirrel
with quick, nervous impulses, jerking his short flat tail. His fur
clothing was neat and clean, fairly shining in the wintry light. The
snowy weather that morning must have called winter to mind; for as soon
as he got his breakfast, he ran to a tuft of dry grass, chewed it into
fuzzy mouthfuls, and carried it to his nest, coming and going with
admirable industry, forecast, and confidence. None watching him as we
did could fail to sympathize with him; and I fancy that in practical
weather wisdom no government forecaster with all his advantages
surpasses this little Alaska rodent, every hair and nerve a weather
instrument.

I greatly enjoyed this little inland side tripâ€”the wide views; the
miners along the branches of the great river, busy as moles and
beavers; young men dreaming and hoping to strike it rich and rush home
to marry their girls faithfully waiting; others hoping to clear off
weary farm mortgages, and brighten the lives of the anxious home folk;
but most, I suppose, just struggling blindly for gold enough to make
them indefinitely rich to spend their lives in aimless affluence,
honor, and ease. I enjoyed getting acquainted with the trees,
especially the beautiful spruce and silver fir; the flower gardens and
great grassy caribou pastures; the cheery, able marmot mountaineer; and
above all the friendship and kindness of Mr. Le Claire, whom I shall
never forget. Bidding good bye, I sauntered back to the head of
navigation on the Stickeen, happy and rich without a particle of
obscuring gold-dust care.




Chapter VII
Glenora Peak


On the trail to the steamboat-landing at the foot of Dease Lake, I met
a Douglas squirrel, nearly as red and rusty in color as his Eastern
relative the chickaree. Except in color he differs but little from the
California Douglas squirrel. In voice, language, gestures, temperament,
he is the same fiery, indomitable little king of the woods. Another
darker and probably younger specimen met near the Caribou House,
barked, chirruped, and showed off in fine style on a tree within a few
feet of us.

â€œWhat does the little rascal mean?â€ said my companion, a man I had
fallen in with on the trail. â€œWhat is he making such a fuss about? I
cannot frighten him.â€

â€œNever mind,â€ I replied; â€œjust wait until I whistle â€˜Old Hundredâ€™ and
you will see him fly in disgust.â€ And so he did, just as his California
brethren do. Strange that no squirrel or spermophile I yet have found
ever seemed to have anything like enough of Scotch religion to enjoy
this grand old tune.

The taverns along the Cassiar gold trail were the worst I had ever
seen, rough shacks with dirt floors, dirt roofs, and rough meals. The
meals are all alikeâ€”a potato, a slice of something like bacon, some
gray stuff called bread, and a cup of muddy, semi-liquid coffee like
that which the California miners call â€œslickersâ€ or â€œslumgullion.â€ The
bread was terrible and sinful. How the Lordâ€™s good wheat could be made
into stuff so mysteriously bad is past finding out. The very deâ€™il, it
would seem, in wicked anger and ingenuity, had been the baker.

On our walk from Dease Lake to Telegraph Creek we had one of these
rough luncheons at three oâ€™clock in the afternoon of the first day,
then walked on five miles to Wardâ€™s, where we were solemnly assured
that we could not have a single bite of either supper or breakfast, but
as a great favor we might sleep on his best gray bunk. We replied that,
as we had lunched at the lake, supper would not be greatly missed, and
as for breakfast we would start early and walk eight miles to the next
road-house. We set out at half-past four, glad to escape into the fresh
air, and reached the breakfast place at eight oâ€™clock. The landlord was
still abed, and when at length he came to the door, he scowled savagely
at us as if our request for breakfast was preposterous and criminal
beyond anything ever heard of in all goldful Alaska. A good many in
those days were returning from the mines dead broke, and he probably
regarded us as belonging to that disreputable class. Anyhow, we got
nothing and had to tramp on.

As we approached the next house, three miles ahead, we saw the
tavern-keeper keenly surveying us, and, as we afterwards learned,
taking me for a certain judge whom for some cause he wished to avoid,
he hurriedly locked his door and fled. Half a mile farther on we
discovered him in a thicket a little way off the trail, explained our
wants, marched him back to his house, and at length obtained a little
sour bread, sour milk, and old salmon, our only lonely meal between the
Lake and Telegraph Creek.

We arrived at Telegraph Creek, the end of my two-hundred-mile walk,
about noon. After luncheon I went on down the river to Glenora in a
fine canoe owned and manned by Kitty, a stout, intelligent-looking
Indian woman, who charged her passengers a dollar for the fifteen-mile
trip. Her crew was four Indian paddlers. In the rapids she also plied
the paddle, with stout, telling strokes, and a keen-eyed old man,
probably her husband, sat high in the stern and steered. All seemed
exhilarated as we shot down through the narrow gorge on the rushing,
roaring, throttled river, paddling all the more vigorously the faster
the speed of the stream, to hold good steering way. The canoe danced
lightly amid gray surges and spray as if alive and enthusiastically
enjoying the adventure. Some of the passengers were pretty thoroughly
drenched. In unskillful hands the frail dugout would surely have been
wrecked or upset. Most of the season goods for the Cassiar gold camps
were carried from Glenora to Telegraph Creek in canoes, the steamers
not being able to overcome the rapids except during high water. Even
then they had usually to line two of the rapidsâ€”that is, take a line
ashore, make it fast to a tree on the bank, and pull up on the capstan.
The freight canoes carried about three or four tons, for which fifteen
dollars per ton was charged. Slow progress was made by poling along the
bank out of the swiftest part of the current. In the rapids a tow line
was taken ashore, only one of the crew remaining aboard to steer. The
trip took a day unless a favoring wind was blowing, which often
happened.

Next morning I set out from Glenora to climb Glenora Peak for the
general view of the great Coast Range that I failed to obtain on my
first ascent on account of the accident that befell Mr. Young when we
were within a minute or two of the top. It is hard to fail in reaching
a mountain-top that one starts for, let the cause be what it may. This
time I had no companion to care for, but the sky was threatening. I was
assured by the local weather-prophets that the day would be rainy or
snowy because the peaks in sight were muffled in clouds that seemed to
be getting ready for work. I determined to go ahead, however, for
storms of any kind are well worth while, and if driven back I could
wait and try again.

With crackers in my pocket and a light rubber coat that a kind Hebrew
passenger on the steamer Gertrude loaned me, I was ready for anything
that might offer, my hopes for the grand view rising and falling as the
clouds rose and fell. Anxiously I watched them as they trailed their
draggled skirts across the glaciers and fountain peaks as if
thoughtfully looking for the places where they could do the most good.
From Glenora there is first a terrace two hundred feet above the river
covered mostly with bushes, yellow apocynum on the open spaces,
together with carpets of dwarf manzanita, bunch-grass, and a few of the
compositÃ¦, galiums, etc. Then comes a flat stretch a mile wide,
extending to the foothills, covered with birch, spruce, fir, and
poplar, now mostly killed by fire and the ground strewn with charred
trunks. From this black forest the mountain rises in rather steep
slopes covered with a luxuriant growth of bushes, grass, flowers, and a
few trees, chiefly spruce and fir, the firs gradually dwarfing into a
beautiful chaparral, the most beautiful, I think, I have ever seen, the
flat fan-shaped plumes thickly foliaged and imbricated by snow
pressure, forming a smooth, handsome thatch which bears cones and
thrives as if this repressed condition were its very best. It extends
up to an elevation of about fifty-five hundred feet. Only a few trees
more than a foot in diameter and more than fifty feet high are found
higher than four thousand feet above the sea. A few poplars and willows
occur on moist places, gradually dwarfing like the conifers. Alder is
the most generally distributed of the chaparral bushes, growing nearly
everywhere; its crinkled stems an inch or two thick form a troublesome
tangle to the mountaineer. The blue geranium, with leaves red and showy
at this time of the year, is perhaps the most telling of the flowering
plants. It grows up to five thousand feet or more. Larkspurs are
common, with epilobium, senecio, erigeron, and a few solidagos. The
harebell appears at about four thousand feet and extends to the summit,
dwarfing in stature but maintaining the size of its handsome bells
until they seem to be lying loose and detached on the ground as if like
snow flowers they had fallen from the sky; and, though
frail and delicate-looking, none of its companions is more enduring or
rings out the praises of beauty-loving Nature in tones more appreciable
to mortals, not forgetting even Cassiope, who also is here, and her
companion, Bryanthus, the loveliest and most widely distributed of the
alpine shrubs. Then come crowberry, and two species of huckleberry, one
of them from about six inches to a foot high with delicious berries,
the other a most lavishly prolific and contented-looking dwarf, few of
the bushes being more than two inches high, counting to the topmost
leaf, yet each bearing from ten to twenty or more large berries.
Perhaps more than half the bulk of the whole plant is fruit, the
largest and finest-flavored of all the huckleberries or blueberries I
ever tasted, spreading fine feasts for the grouse and ptarmigan and
many others of Natureâ€™s mountain people. I noticed three species of
dwarf willows, one with narrow leaves, growing at the very summit of
the mountain in cracks of the rocks, as well as on patches of soil,
another with large, smooth leaves now turning yellow. The third species
grows between the others as to elevation; its leaves, then
orange-colored, are strikingly pitted and reticulated. Another alpine
shrub, a species of sericocarpus, covered with handsome heads of
feathery achenia, beautiful dwarf echiverias with flocks of purple
flowers pricked into their bright grass-green, cushion-like bosses of
moss-like foliage, and a fine forget-me-not reach to the summit. I may
also mention a large mertensia, a fine anemone, a veratrum, six feet
high, a large blue daisy, growing up to three to four thousand feet,
and at the summit a dwarf species, with dusky, hairy involucres, and a
few ferns, aspidium, gymnogramma, and small rock cheilanthes, leaving
scarce a foot of ground bare, though the mountain looks bald and brown
in the distance like those of the desert ranges of the Great Basin in
Utah and Nevada.

Charmed with these plant people, I had almost forgotten to watch the
sky until I reached the top of the highest peak, when one of the
greatest and most impressively sublime of all the mountain views I have
ever enjoyed came full in sightâ€”more than three hundred miles of
closely packed peaks of the great Coast Range, sculptured in the
boldest manner imaginable, their naked tops and dividing ridges dark in
color, their sides and the caÃ±ons, gorges, and valleys between them
loaded with glaciers and snow. From this standpoint I counted upwards
of two hundred glaciers, while dark-centred luminous clouds with
fringed edges hovered and crawled over them, now slowly descending,
casting transparent shadows on the ice and snow, now rising high above
them, lingering like loving angels guarding the crystal gifts they had
bestowed. Although the range as seen from this Glenora mountain-top
seems regular in its trend, as if the main axis were simple and
continuous, it is, on the contrary, far from simple. In front of the
highest ranks of peaks are others of the same form with their own
glaciers, and lower peaks before these, and yet lower ones with their
ridges and caÃ±ons, valleys and foothills. Alps rise beyond alps as far
as the eye can reach, and clusters of higher peaks here and there
closely crowded together; clusters, too, of needles and pinnacles
innumerable like trees in groves. Everywhere the peaks seem
comparatively slender and closely packed, as if Nature had here been
trying to see how many noble well-dressed mountains could be crowded
into one grand range.

The black rocks, too steep for snow to lie upon, were brought into
sharp relief by white clouds and snow and glaciers, and these again
were outlined and made tellingly plain by the rocks. The glaciers so
grandly displayed are of every form, some crawling through gorge and
valley like monster glittering serpents; others like broad cataracts
pouring over cliffs into shadowy gulfs; others, with their main trunks
winding through narrow caÃ±ons, display long, white finger-like
tributaries descending from the summits of pinnacled ridges. Others lie
back in fountain cirques walled in all around save at the lower edge
over which they pour in blue cascades. Snow, too, lay in folds and
patches of every form on blunt, rounded ridges in curves, arrowy lines,
dashes, and narrow ornamental flutings among the summit peaks and in
broad radiating wings on smooth slopes. And on many a bulging headland
and lower ridge there lay heavy, over-curling copings and smooth, white
domes where wind-driven snow was pressed and wreathed and packed into
every form and in every possible place and condition. I never before
had seen so richly sculptured a range or so many awe-inspiring
inaccessible mountains crowded together. If a line were
drawn east and west from the peak on which I stood, and extended both
ways to the horizon, cutting the whole round landscape in two equal
parts, then all of the south half would be bounded by these icy peaks,
which would seem to curve around half the horizon and about twenty
degrees more, though extending in a general straight, or but moderately
curved, line. The deepest and thickest and highest of all this
wilderness of peaks lie to the southwest. They are probably from about
nine to twelve thousand feet high, springing to this elevation from
near the sea-level. The peak on which these observations were made is
somewhere about seven thousand feet high, and from here I estimated the
height of the range. The highest peak of all, or that seemed so to me,
lies to the westward at an estimated distance of about one hundred and
fifty or two hundred miles. Only its solid white summit was visible.
Possibly it may be the topmost peak of St. Elias. Now look northward
around the other half of the horizon, and instead of countless peaks
crowding into the sky, you see a low brown region, heaving and swelling
in gentle curves, apparently scarcely more waved than a rolling
prairie. The so-called caÃ±ons of several forks of the upper Stickeen
are visible, but even where best seen in the foreground and middle
ground of the picture, they are like mere sunken gorges, making scarce
perceptible marks on the landscape, while the tops of the highest
mountain-swells show only small patches of snow and no glaciers.

Glenora Peak, on which I stood, is the highest point of a spur that
puts out from the main range in a northerly direction. It seems to have
been a rounded, broad-backed ridge which has been sculptured into its
present irregular form by short residual glaciers, some of which, a
mile or two long, are still at work.

As I lingered, gazing on the vast show, luminous shadowy clouds seemed
to increase in glory of color and motion, now fondling the highest
peaks with infinite tenderness of touch, now hovering above them like
eagles over their nests.

When night was drawing near, I ran down the flowery slopes exhilarated,
thanking God for the gift of this great day. The setting sun fired the
clouds. All the world seemed new-born. Every thing, even the commonest,
was seen in new light and was looked at with new interest as if never
seen before. The plant people seemed glad, as if rejoicing with me, the
little ones as well as the trees, while every feature of the peak and
its traveled boulders seemed to know what I had been about and the
depth of my joy, as if they could read faces.




Chapter VIII
Exploration of the Stickeen Glaciers


Next day I planned an excursion to the so-called Dirt Glacier, the most
interesting to Indians and steamer men of all the Stickeen glaciers
from its mysterious floods. I left the steamer Gertrude for the glacier
delta an hour or two before sunset. The captain kindly loaned me his
canoe and two of his Indian deck hands, who seemed much puzzled to know
what the rare service required of them might mean, and on leaving bade
a merry adieu to their companions. We camped on the west side of the
river opposite the front of the glacier, in a spacious valley
surrounded by snowy mountains. Thirteen small glaciers were in sight
and four waterfalls. It was a fine, serene evening, and the highest
peaks were wearing turbans of flossy, gossamer cloud-stuff. I had my
supper before leaving the steamer, so I had only to make a campfire,
spread my blanket, and lie down. The Indians had their own bedding and
lay beside their own fire.

The Dirt Glacier is noted among the river men as being subject to
violent flood outbursts once or twice a year, usually in the late
summer. The delta of this glacier stream is three or four miles wide
where it fronts the river, and the many rough channels with which it is
guttered and the uprooted trees and huge boulders that roughen its
surface manifest the power of the floods that swept them to their
places; but under ordinary conditions the glacier discharges its
drainage water into the river through only four or five of the
delta-channels.

Our camp was made on the south or lower side of the delta, below all
the draining streams, so that I would not have to ford any of them on
my way to the glacier. The Indians chose a sand-pit to sleep in; I
chose a level spot back of a drift log. I had but little to say to my
companions as they could speak no English, nor I much Thlinkit or
Chinook. In a few minutes after landing they retired to their pit and
were soon asleep and asnore. I lingered by the fire until after ten
oâ€™clock, for the night sky was clear, and the great white mountains in
the starlight seemed nearer than by day and to be looking down like
guardians of the valley, while the waterfalls, and the torrents
escaping from beneath the big glacier, roared in a broad, low monotone,
sounding as if close at hand, though, as it proved next day, the
nearest was three miles away. After wrapping myself in my blankets, I
still gazed into the marvelous sky and made out to sleep only about two
hours. Then, without waking the noisy sleepers, I arose, ate a piece of
bread, and set out in my shirt-sleeves, determined to make the most of
the time at my disposal. The captain was to pick us up about noon at a
woodpile about a mile from here; but if in the mean time the steamer
should run aground and he should need his canoe, a three whistle signal
would be given.

Following a dry channel for about a mile, I came suddenly upon the main
outlet of the glacier, which in the imperfect light seemed as large as
the river, about one hundred and fifty feet wide, and perhaps three or
four feet deep. A little farther up it was only about fifty feet wide
and rushing on with impetuous roaring force in its rocky channel,
sweeping forward sand, gravel, cobblestones, and boulders, the bump and
rumble sounds of the largest of these rolling stones being readily
heard in the midst of the roaring. It was too swift and rough to ford,
and no bridge tree could be found, for the great floods had cleared
everything out of their way. I was therefore compelled to keep on up
the right bank, however difficult the way. Where a strip of bare
boulders lined the margin, the walking was easy, but where the current
swept close along the ragged edge of the forest, progress was difficult
and slow on account of snow-crinkled and interlaced thickets of alder
and willow, reinforced with fallen trees and thorny devilâ€™s-club
(_Echinopanax horridum_), making a jungle all but impenetrable. The
mile of this extravagantly difficult growth through which I struggled,
inch by inch, will not soon be forgotten. At length arriving within a
few hundred yards of the glacier, full of panax barbs, I found that
both the glacier and its unfordable stream were pressing hard against a
shelving cliff, dangerously steep, leaving no margin, and compelling me
to scramble along its face before I could get on to the glacier. But by
sunrise all these cliff, jungle, and torrent troubles were overcome and
I gladly found myself free on the magnificent ice-river.

The curving, out-bulging front of the glacier is about two miles wide,
two hundred feet high, and its surface for a mile or so above the front
is strewn with moraine detritus, giving it a strangely dirty, dusky
look, hence its name, the â€œDirt Glacier,â€ this detritus-laden portion
being all that is seen in passing up the river. A mile or two beyond
the moraine-covered part I was surprised to find alpine plants growing
on the ice, fresh and green, some of them in full flower. These curious
glacier gardens, the first I had seen, were evidently planted by snow
avalanches from the high walls. They were well watered, of course, by
the melting surface of the ice and fairly well nourished by humus still
attached to the roots, and in some places formed beds of considerable
thickness. Seedling trees and bushes also were growing among the
flowers. Admiring these novel floating gardens, I struck out for the
middle of the pure white glacier, where the ice seemed smoother, and
then held straight on for about eight miles, where I reluctantly turned
back to meet the steamer, greatly regretting that I had not brought a
weekâ€™s supply of hardtack to allow me to explore the glacier to its
head, and then trust to some passing canoe to take me down to Buck
Station, from which I could explore the Big Stickeen Glacier.

Altogether, I saw about fifteen or sixteen miles of the main trunk. The
grade is almost regular, and the walls on either hand are about from
two to three thousand feet high, sculptured like those of Yosemite
Valley. I found no difficulty of an extraordinary kind. Many a crevasse
had to be crossed, but most of them were narrow and easily jumped,
while the few wide ones that lay in my way were crossed on sliver
bridges or avoided by passing around them. The structure of the glacier
was strikingly revealed on its melting surface. It is made up of thin
vertical or inclined sheets or slabs set on edge and welded together.
They represent, I think, the successive snowfalls from heavy storms on
the tributaries. One of the tributaries on the right side, about three
miles above the front, has been entirely melted off from the trunk and
has receded two or three miles, forming an independent glacier. Across
the mouth of this abandoned part of its channel the main glacier flows,
forming a dam which gives rise to a lake. On the head of the detached
tributary there are some five or six small residual glaciers, the
drainage of which, with that of the snowy mountain slopes above them,
discharges into the lake, whose outlet is through a channel or channels
beneath the damming glacier. Now these sub-channels are occasionally
blocked and the water rises until it flows alongside of the glacier,
but as the dam is a moving one, a grand outburst is sometimes made,
which, draining the large lake, produces a flood of amazing power,
sweeping down immense quantities of moraine material and raising the
river all the way down to its mouth, so that several trips may
occasionally be made by the steamers after the season of low water has
laid them up for the year. The occurrence of these floods are, of
course, well known to the Indians and steamboat men, though they know
nothing of their cause. They simply remark, â€œThe Dirt Glacier has
broken out again.â€

I greatly enjoyed my walk up this majestic ice-river, charmed by the
pale-blue, ineffably fine light in the crevasses, moulins, and wells,
and the innumerable azure pools in basins of azure ice, and the network
of surface streams, large and small, gliding, swirling with wonderful
grace of motion in their frictionless channels, calling forth devout
admiration at almost every step and filling the mind with a sense of
Natureâ€™s endless beauty and power. Looking ahead from the middle of the
glacier, you see the broad white flood, though apparently rigid as
iron, sweeping in graceful curves between its high mountain-like walls,
small glaciers hanging in the hollows on either side, and snow in every
form above them, and the great down-plunging granite buttresses and
headlands of the walls marvelous in bold massive sculpture; forests in
side caÃ±ons to within fifty feet of the glacier; avalanche pathways
overgrown with alder and willow; innumerable cascades keeping up a
solemn harmony of water sounds blending with those of the glacier
moulins and rills; and as far as the eye can reach, tributary glaciers
at short intervals silently descending from their high, white fountains
to swell the grand central ice-river.

In the angle formed by the main glacier and the lake that gives rise to
the river floods, there is a massive granite dome sparsely feathered
with trees, and just beyond this yosemitic rock is a mountain, perhaps
ten thousand feet high, laden with ice and snow which seemed pure
pearly white in the morning light. Last evening as seen from camp it
was adorned with a cloud streamer, and both the streamer and the peak
were flushed in the alpenglow. A mile or two above this mountain, on
the opposite side of the glacier, there is a rock like the Yosemite
Sentinel; and in general all the wall rocks as far as I saw them are
more or less yosemitic in form and color and streaked with cascades.

But wonderful as this noble ice-river is in size and depth and in power
displayed, far more wonderful was the vastly greater glacier three or
four thousand feet, or perhaps a mile, in depth, whose size and general
history is inscribed on the sides of the walls and over the tops of the
rocks in characters which have not yet been greatly dimmed by the
weather. Comparing its present size with that when it was in its prime,
is like comparing a small rivulet to the same stream when it is a
roaring torrent.

The return trip to the camp past the shelving cliff and through the
weary devilâ€™s-club jungle was made in a few hours. The Indians had gone
off picking berries, but were on the watch for me and hailed me as I
approached. The captain had called for me, and, after waiting three
hours, departed for Wrangell without leaving any food, to make sure, I
suppose, of a quick return of his Indians and canoe. This was no
serious matter, however, for the swift current swept us down to Buck
Station, some thirty-five miles distant, by eight oâ€™clock. Here I
remained to study the â€œBig Stickeen Glacier,â€ but the Indians set out
for Wrangell soon after supper, though I invited them to stay till
morning.

The weather that morning, August 27, was dark and rainy, and I tried to
persuade myself that I ought to rest a day before setting out on new
ice work. But just across the river the â€œBig Glacierâ€ was staring me in
the face, pouring its majestic flood through a broad mountain gateway
and expanding in the spacious river valley to a width of four or five
miles, while dim in the gray distance loomed its high mountain
fountains. So grand an invitation displayed in characters so telling
was of course irresistible, and body-care and weather-care vanished.

Mr. Choquette, the keeper of the station, ferried me across the river,
and I spent the day in getting general views and planning the work that
had been long in mind. I first traced the broad, complicated terminal
moraine to its southern extremity, climbed up the west side along the
lateral moraine three or four miles, making my way now on the glacier,
now on the moraine-covered bank, and now compelled to climb up through
the timber and brush in order to pass some rocky headland, until I
reached a point commanding a good general view of the lower end of the
glacier. Heavy, blotting rain then began to fall, and I retraced my
steps, oftentimes stopping to admire the blue ice-caves into which
glad, rejoicing streams from the mountain-side were hurrying as if
going home, while the glacier seemed to open wide its crystal gateways
to welcome them.

The following morning blotting rain was still falling, but time and
work was too precious to mind it. Kind Mr. Choquette put me across the
river in a canoe, with a lot of biscuits his Indian wife had baked for
me and some dried salmon, a little sugar and tea, a blanket, and a
piece of light sheeting for shelter from rain during the night, all
rolled into one bundle.

â€œWhen shall I expect you back?â€ inquired Choquette, when I bade him
good-bye.

â€œOh, any time,â€ I replied. â€œI shall see as much as possible of the
glacier, and I know not how long it will hold me.â€

â€œWell, but when will I come to look for you, if anything happens? Where
are you going to try to go? Years ago Russian officers from Sitka went
up the glacier from here and none ever returned. Itâ€™s a mighty
dangerous glacier, all full of damn deep holes and cracks. Youâ€™ve no
idea what ticklish deceiving traps are scattered over it.â€

â€œYes, I have,â€ I said. â€œI have seen glaciers before, though none so big
as this one. Do not look for me until I make my appearance on the
river-bank. Never mind me. I am used to caring for myself.â€ And so,
shouldering my bundle, I trudged off through the moraine boulders and
thickets.

My general plan was to trace the terminal moraine to its extreme north
end, pitch my little tent, leave the blanket and most of the hardtack,
and from this main camp go and come as hunger required or allowed.

After examining a cross-section of the broad moraine, roughened by
concentric masses, marking interruptions in the recession of the
glacier of perhaps several centuries, in which the successive moraines
were formed and shoved together in closer or wider order, I traced the
moraine to its northeastern extremity and ascended the glacier for
several miles along the left margin, then crossed it at the grand
cataract and down the right side to the river, and along the moraine to
the point of beginning.

On the older portions of this moraine I discovered several kettles in
process of formation and was pleased to find that they conformed in the
most striking way with the theory I had already been led to make from
observations on the old kettles which form so curious a feature of the
drift covering Wisconsin and Minnesota and some of the larger moraines
of the residual glaciers in the California Sierra. I found a pit eight
or ten feet deep with raw shifting sides countersunk abruptly in the
rough moraine material, and at the bottom, on sliding down by the aid
of a lithe spruce tree that was being undermined, I discovered, after
digging down a foot or two, that the bottom was resting on a block of
solid blue ice which had been buried in the moraine perhaps a century
or more, judging by the age of the tree that had grown above it.
Probably more than another century will be required to complete the
formation of this kettle by the slow melting of the buried ice-block.
The moraine material of course was falling in as the ice melted, and
the sides maintained an angle as steep as the material would lie. All
sorts of theories have been advanced for the formation of these
kettles, so abundant in the drift over a great part of the United
States, and I was glad to be able to set the question at rest, at least
as far as I was concerned.

The glacier and the mountains about it are on so grand a scale and so
generally inaccessible in the ordinary sense, it seemed to matter but
little what course I pursued. Everything was full of interest, even the
weather, though about as unfavorable as possible for wide views, and
scrambling through the moraine jungle brush kept one as wet as if all
the way was beneath a cascade.

I pushed on, with many a rest and halt to admire the bold and
marvelously sculptured ice-front, looking all the grander and more
striking in the gray mist with all the rest of the glacier shut out,
until I came to a lake about two hundred yards wide and two miles long
with scores of small bergs floating in it, some aground, close inshore
against the moraine, the light playing on their angles and shimmering
in their blue caves in ravishing tones. This proved to be the largest
of the series of narrow lakelets that lie in shallow troughs between
the moraine and the glacier, a miniature Arctic Ocean, its ice-cliffs
played upon by whispering, rippling waveless and its small berg floes
drifting in its currents or with the wind, or stranded here and there
along its rocky moraine shore.

Hundreds of small rills and good-sized streams were falling into the
lake from the glacier, singing in low tones, some of them pouring in
sheer falls over blue cliffs from narrow ice-valleys, some spouting
from pipelike channels in the solid front of the glacier, others
gurgling out of arched openings at the base. All these water-streams
were riding on the parent ice-stream, their voices joined in one grand
anthem telling the wonders of their near and far-off fountains. The
lake itself is resting in a basin of ice, and the forested moraine,
though seemingly cut off from the glacier and probably more than a
century old, is in great part resting on buried ice left behind as the
glacier receded, and melting slowly on account of the protection
afforded by the moraine detritus, which keeps shifting and falling on
the inner face long after it is overgrown with lichens, mosses,
grasses, bushes, and even good-sized trees; these changes going on with
marvelous deliberation until in fullness of time the whole moraine
settles down upon its bedrock foundation.

The outlet of the lake is a large stream, almost a river in size, one
of the main draining streams of the glacier. I attempted to ford it
where it begins to break in rapids in passing over the moraine, but
found it too deep and rough on the bottom. I then tried to ford at its
head, where it is wider and glides smoothly out of the lake, bracing
myself against the current with a pole, but found it too deep, and when
the icy water reached my shoulders I cautiously struggled back to the
moraine. I next followed it down through the rocky jungle to a place
where in breaking across the moraine dam it was only about thirty-five
feet wide. Here I found a spruce tree which I felled for a bridge; it
reached across, about ten feet of the top holding in the bank brush.
But the force of the torrent, acting on the submerged branches and the
slender end of the trunk, bent it like a bow and made it very unsteady,
and after testing it by going out about a third of the way over, it
seemed likely to be carried away when bent deeper into the current by
my weight. Fortunately, I discovered another larger tree well situated
a little farther down, which I felled, and though a few feet in the
middle was submerged, it seemed perfectly safe.

As it was now getting late, I started back to the lakeside where I had
left my bundle, and in trying to hold a direct course found the
interlaced jungle still more difficult than it was along the bank of
the torrent. For over an hour I had to creep and struggle close to the
rocky ground like a fly in a spider-web without being able to obtain a
single glimpse of any guiding feature of the landscape. Finding a
little willow taller than the surrounding alders, I climbed it, caught
sight of the glacier-front, took a compass bearing, and sunk again into
the dripping, blinding maze of brush, and at length emerged on the
lake-shore seven hours after leaving it, all this time as wet as though
I had been swimming, thus completing a trying dayâ€™s work. But
everything was deliciously fresh, and I found new and old plant
friends, and lessons on Natureâ€™s Alaska moraine landscape-gardening
that made everything bright and light.

It was now near dark, and I made haste to make up my flimsy little
tent. The ground was desperately rocky. I made out, however, to level
down a strip large enough to lie on, and by means of slim alder stems
bent over it and tied together soon had a home. While thus busily
engaged I was startled by a thundering roar across the lake. Running to
the top of the moraine, I discovered that the tremendous noise was only
the outcry of a newborn berg about fifty or sixty feet in diameter,
rocking and wallowing in the waves it had raised as if enjoying its
freedom after its long grinding work as part of the glacier. After this
fine last lesson I managed to make a small fire out of wet twigs, got a
cup of tea, stripped off my dripping clothing, wrapped myself in a
blanket and lay brooding on the gains of the day and plans for the
morrow, glad, rich, and almost comfortable.

It was raining hard when I awoke, but I made up my mind to disregard
the weather, put on my dripping clothing, glad to know it was fresh and
clean; ate biscuits and a piece of dried salmon without attempting to
make a tea fire; filled a bag with hardtack, slung it over my shoulder,
and with my indispensable ice-axe plunged once more into the dripping
jungle. I found my bridge holding bravely in place against the swollen
torrent, crossed it and beat my way around pools and logs and through
two hours of tangle back to the moraine on the north side of the
outlet,â€”a wet, weary battle but not without enjoyment. The smell of the
washed ground and vegetation made every breath a pleasure, and I found
_Calypso borealis_, the first I had seen on this side of the continent,
one of my darlings, worth any amount of hardship; and I saw one of my
Douglas squirrels on the margin of a grassy pool. The drip of the rain
on the various leaves was pleasant to hear. More especially marked were
the flat low-toned bumps and splashes of large drops from the trees on
the broad horizontal leaves of _Echinopanax horridum_, like the
drumming of thundershower drops on veratrum and palm leaves, while the
mosses were indescribably beautiful, so fresh, so bright, so cheerily
green, and all so low and calm and silent, however heavy and wild the
wind and the rain blowing and pouring above them. Surely never a
particle of dust has touched leaf or crown of all these blessed mosses;
and how bright were the red rims of the cladonia cups beside them, and
the fruit of the dwarf cornel! And the wet berries, Natureâ€™s precious
jewelry, how beautiful they were!â€”huckleberries with pale bloom and a
crystal drop on each; red and yellow salmon-berries, with clusters of
smaller drops; and the glittering, berry-like raindrops adorning the
interlacing arches of bent grasses and sedges around the edges of the
pools, every drop a mirror with all the landscape in it. Aâ€™ that and aâ€™
that and twice as muckleâ€™s aâ€™ that in this glorious Alaska day,
recalling, however different, George Herbertâ€™s â€œSweet day, so cool, so
calm, so bright.â€

In the gardens and forests of this wonderful moraine one might spend a
whole joyful life.

When I at last reached the end of the great moraine and the front of
the mountain that forms the north side of the glacier basin, I tried to
make my way along its side, but, finding the climbing tedious and
difficult, took to the glacier and fared well, though a good deal of
step-cutting was required on its ragged, crevassed margin. When night
was drawing nigh, I scanned the steep mountainside in search of an
accessible bench, however narrow, where a bed and a fire might be
gathered for a camp. About dark great was my delight to find a little
shelf with a few small mountain hemlocks growing in cleavage joints.
Projecting knobs below it enabled me to build a platform for a
fireplace and a bed, and by industrious creeping from one fissure to
another, cutting bushes and small trees and sliding them down to within
reach of my rock-shelf, I made out to collect wood enough to last
through the night. In an hour or two I had a cheery fire, and spent the
night in turning from side to side, steaming and drying after being wet
two days and a night. Fortunately this night it did not rain, but it
was very cold.

Pushing on next day, I climbed to the top of the glacier by ice-steps
and along its side to the grand cataract two miles wide where the whole
majestic flood of the glacier pours like a mighty surging river down a
steep declivity in its channel. After gazing a long time on the
glorious show, I discovered a place beneath the edge of the cataract
where it flows over a hard, resisting granite rib, into which I crawled
and enjoyed the novel and instructive view of a glacier pouring over my
head, showing not only its grinding, polishing action, but how it
breaks off large angular boulder-massesâ€”a most telling lesson in
earth-sculpture, confirming many I had already learned in the glacier
basins of the High Sierra of California. I then crossed to the south
side, noting the forms of the huge blocks into which the glacier was
broken in passing over the brow of the cataract, and how they were
welded.

The weather was now clear, opening views according to my own heart far
into the high snowy fountains. I saw what seemed the farthest
mountains, perhaps thirty miles from the front, everywhere
winter-bound, but thick forested, however steep, for a distance of at
least fifteen miles from the front, the trees, hemlock and spruce,
clinging to the rock by root-holds among cleavage joints. The greatest
discovery was in methods of denudation displayed beneath the glacier.

After a few more days of exhilarating study I returned to the
river-bank opposite Choquetteâ€™s landing. Promptly at sight of the
signal I made, the kind Frenchman came across for me in his canoe. At
his house I enjoyed a rest while writing out notes; then examined the
smaller glacier fronting the one I had been exploring, until a passing
canoe bound for Fort Wrangell took me aboard.




Chapter IX
A Canoe Voyage to Northward


I arrived at Wrangell in a canoe with a party of Cassiar miners in
October while the icy regions to the northward still burned in my mind.
I had met several prospectors who had been as far as Chilcat at the
head of Lynn Canal, who told wonderful stories about the great glaciers
they had seen there. All the high mountains up there, they said, seemed
to be made of ice, and if glaciers â€œare what you are after, thatâ€™s the
place for you,â€ and to get there â€œall you have to do is to hire a good
canoe and Indians who know the way.â€

But it now seemed too late to set out on so long a voyage. The days
were growing short and winter was drawing nigh when all the land would
be buried in snow. On the other hand, though this wilderness was new to
me, I was familiar with storms and enjoyed them. The main channels
extending along the coast remain open all winter, and, their shores
being well forested, I knew that it would be easy to keep warm in camp,
while abundance of food could be carried. I determined, therefore, to
go ahead as far north as possible, to see and learn what I could,
especially with reference to future work. When I made known my plans to
Mr. Young, he offered to go with me, and, being acquainted with the
Indians, procured a good canoe and crew, and with a large stock of
provisions and blankets, we left Wrangell October 14, eager to welcome
weather of every sort, as long as food lasted.

I was anxious to make an early start, but it was half-past two in the
afternoon before I could get my Indians togetherâ€”Toyatte, a grand old
Stickeen nobleman, who was made captain, not only because he owned the
canoe, but for his skill in woodcraft and seamanship; Kadachan, the son
of a Chilcat chief; John, a Stickeen, who acted as interpreter; and
Sitka Charley. Mr. Young, my companion, was an adventurous evangelist,
and it was the opportunities the trip might afford to meet the Indians
of the different tribes on our route with reference to future
missionary work, that induced him to join us.

When at last all were aboard and we were about to cast loose from the
wharf, Kadachanâ€™s mother, a woman of great natural dignity and force of
character, came down the steps alongside the canoe oppressed with
anxious fears for the safety of her son. Standing silent for a few
moments, she held the missionary with her dark, bodeful eyes, and with
great solemnity of speech and gesture accused him of using undue
influence in gaining her sonâ€™s consent to go on a dangerous voyage
among unfriendly tribes; and like an ancient sibyl foretold a long
train of bad luck from storms and enemies, and finished by saying, â€œIf
my son comes not back, on you will be his blood, and you shall pay. I
say it.â€

Mr. Young tried in vain to calm her fears, promising Heavenâ€™s care as
well as his own for her precious son, assuring her that he would
faithfully share every danger that he encountered, and if need be die
in his defense.

â€œWe shall see whether or not you die,â€ she said, and turned away.

Toyatte also encountered domestic difficulties. When he stepped into
the canoe I noticed a cloud of anxiety on his grand old face, as if his
doom now drawing near was already beginning to overshadow him. When he
took leave of his wife, she refused to shake hands with him, wept
bitterly, and said that his enemies, the Chilcat chiefs, would be sure
to kill him in case he reached their village. But it was not on this
trip that the old hero was to meet his fate, and when we were fairly
free in the wilderness and a gentle breeze pressed us joyfully over the
shining waters these gloomy forebodings vanished.

We first pursued a westerly course, through Sumner Strait, between
Kupreanof and Prince of Wales Islands, then, turning northward, sailed
up the Kiku Strait through the midst of innumerable picturesque islets,
across Prince Frederickâ€™s Sound, up Chatham Strait, thence
northwestward through Icy Strait and around the then uncharted Glacier
Bay. Thence returning through Icy Strait, we sailed up the beautiful
Lynn Canal to the Davidson Glacier and the lower village of the Chilcat
tribe and returned to Wrangell along the coast of the mainland,
visiting the icy Sum Dum Bay and the Wrangell Glacier on our route.
Thus we made a journey more than eight hundred miles long, and though
hardships and perhaps dangers were encountered, the great wonderland
made compensation beyond our most extravagant hopes. Neither rain nor
snow stopped us, but when the wind was too wild, Kadachan and the old
captain stayed on guard in the camp and John and Charley went into the
woods deer-hunting, while I examined the adjacent rocks and woods. Most
of our camp-grounds were in sheltered nooks where good firewood was
abundant, and where the precious canoe could be safely drawn up beyond
reach of the waves. After supper we sat long around the fire, listening
to the Indianâ€™s stories about the wild animals, their
hunting-adventures, wars, traditions, religion, and customs. Every
Indian party we met we interviewed, and visited every village we came
to.

Our first camp was made at a place called the Island of the Standing
Stone, on the shore of a shallow bay. The weather was fine. The
mountains of the mainland were unclouded, excepting one, which had a
horizontal ruff of dull slate color, but its icy summit covered with
fresh snow towered above the cloud, flushed like its neighbors in the
alpenglow. All the large islands in sight were densely forested, while
many small rock islets in front of our camp were treeless or nearly so.
Some of them were distinctly glaciated even belong the tide-line, the
effects of wave washing and general weathering being scarce appreciable
as yet. Some of the larger islets had a few trees, others only grass.
One looked in the distance like a two-masted ship flying before the
wind under press of sail.

Next morning the mountains were arrayed in fresh snow that had fallen
during the night down to within a hundred feet of the sea-level. We
made a grand fire, and after an early breakfast pushed merrily on all
day along beautiful forested shores embroidered with autumn-colored
bushes. I noticed some pitchy trees that had been deeply hacked for
kindling-wood and torches, precious conveniences to belated voyagers on
stormy nights. Before sundown we camped in a beautiful nook of Deer
Bay, shut in from every wind by gray-bearded trees and fringed with
rose bushes, rubus, potentilla, asters, etc. Some of the lichen tresses
depending from the branches were six feet in length.

A dozen rods or so from our camp we discovered a family of Kake Indians
snugly sheltered in a portable bark hut, a stout middle-aged man with
his wife, son, and daughter, and his sonâ€™s wife. After our tent was set
and fire made, the head of the family paid us a visit and presented us
with a fine salmon, a pair of mallard ducks, and a mess of potatoes. We
paid a return visit with gifts of rice and tobacco, etc. Mr. Young
spoke briefly on mission affairs and inquired whether their tribe would
be likely to welcome a teacher or missionary. But they seemed unwilling
to offer an opinion on so important a subject. The following words from
the head of the family was the only reply:â€”

â€œWe have not much to say to you fellows. We always do to Boston men as
we have done to you, give a little of whatever we have, treat everybody
well and never quarrel. This is all we have to say.â€

Our Kake neighbors set out for Fort Wrangell next morning, and we
pushed gladly on toward Chilcat. We passed an island that had lost all
its trees in a storm, but a hopeful crop of young ones was springing up
to take their places. I found no trace of fire in these woods. The
ground was covered with leaves, branches, and fallen trunks perhaps a
dozen generations deep, slowly decaying, forming a grand mossy mass of
ruins, kept fresh and beautiful. All that is repulsive about death was
here hidden beneath abounding life. Some rocks along the shore were
completely covered with crimson-leafed huckleberry bushes; one species
still in fruit might well be called the winter huckleberry. In a short
walk I found vetches eight feet high leaning on raspberry bushes, and
tall ferns and _Smilacina unifolia_ with leaves six inches wide growing
on yellow-green moss, producing a beautiful effect.

Our Indians seemed to be enjoying a quick and merry reaction from the
doleful domestic dumps in which the voyage was begun. Old and young
behaved this afternoon like a lot of truant boys on a lark. When we
came to a pond fenced off from the main channel by a moraine dam, John
went ashore to seek a shot at ducks. Creeping up behind the dam, he
killed a mallard fifty or sixty feet from the shore and attempted to
wave it within reach by throwing stones back of it. Charley and
Kadachan went to his help, enjoying the sport, especially enjoying
their own blunders in throwing in front of it and thus driving the duck
farther out. To expedite the business John then tried to throw a rope
across it, but failed after repeated trials, and so did each in turn,
all laughing merrily at their awkward bungling. Next they tied a stone
to the end of the rope to carry it further and with better aim, but the
result was no better. Then majestic old Toyatte tried his hand at the
game. He tied the rope to one of the canoe-poles, and taking aim threw
it, harpoon fashion, beyond the duck, and the general merriment was
redoubled when the pole got loose and floated out to the middle of the
pond. At length John stripped, swam to the duck, threw it ashore, and
brought in the pole in his teeth, his companions meanwhile making merry
at his expense by splashing the water in front of him and making the
dead duck go through the motions of fighting and biting him in the face
as he landed.

The morning after this delightful day was dark and threatening. A high
wind was rushing down the strait dead against us, and just as we were
about ready to start, determined to fight our way by creeping close
inshore, pelting rain began to fly. We concluded therefore to wait for
better weather. The hunters went out for deer and I to see the forests.
The rain brought out the fragrance of the drenched trees, and the wind
made wild melody in their tops, while every brown bole was embroidered
by a network of rain rills. Perhaps the most delightful part of my
ramble was along a stream that flowed through a leafy arch beneath
overleaping trees which met at the top. The water was almost black in
the deep pools and fine clear amber in the shallows. It was the pure,
rich wine of the woods with a pleasant taste, bringing spicy spruce
groves and widespread bog and beaver meadows to mind. On this amber
stream I discovered an interesting fall. It is only a few feet high,
but remarkably fine in the curve of its brow and blending shades of
color, while the mossy, bushy pool into which it plunges is inky black,
but wonderfully brightened by foam bells larger than common that drift
in clusters on the smooth water around the rim, each of them carrying a
picture of the overlooking trees leaning together at the tips like the
teeth of moss capsules before they rise.

I found most of the trees here fairly loaded with mosses. Some broadly
palmated branches had beds of yellow moss so wide and deep that when
wet they must weigh a hundred pounds or even more. Upon these moss-beds
ferns and grasses and even good-sized seedling trees grow, making
beautiful hanging gardens in which the curious spectacle is presented
of old trees holding hundreds of their own children in their arms,
nourished by rain and dew and the decaying leaves showered down to them
by their parents. The branches upon which these beds of mossy soil rest
become flat and irregular like weathered roots or the antlers of deer,
and at length die; and when the whole tree has thus been killed it
seems to be standing on its head with roots in the air. A striking
example of this sort stood near the camp and I called the missionaryâ€™s
attention to it.

â€œCome, Mr. Young,â€ I shouted. â€œHereâ€™s something wonderful, the most
wonderful tree you ever saw; it is standing on its head.â€

â€œHow in the world,â€ said he in astonishment, â€œcould that tree have been
plucked up by the roots, carried high in the air, and dropped down head
foremost into the ground. It must have been the work of a tornado.â€

Toward evening the hunters brought in a deer. They had seen four
others, and at the camp-fire talk said that deer abounded on all the
islands of considerable size and along the shores of the mainland. But
few were to be found in the interior on account of wolves that ran them
down where they could not readily take refuge in the water. The
Indians, they said, hunted them on the islands with trained dogs which
went into the woods and drove them out, while the hunters lay in wait
in canoes at the points where they were likely to take to the water.
Beaver and black bear also abounded on this large island. I saw but few
birds there, only ravens, jays, and wrens. Ducks, gulls, bald eagles,
and jays are the commonest birds hereabouts. A flock of swans flew
past, sounding their startling human-like cry which seemed yet more
striking in this lonely wilderness. The Indians said that geese, swans,
cranes, etc., making their long journeys in regular order thus called
aloud to encourage each other and enable them to keep stroke and time
like men in rowing or marching (a sort of â€œRow, brothers, row,â€ or
â€œHip, hipâ€ of marching soldiers).

October 18 was about half sunshine, half rain and wet snow, but we
paddled on through the midst of the innumerable islands in more than
half comfort, enjoying the changing effects of the weather on the
dripping wilderness. Strolling a little way back into the woods when we
went ashore for luncheon, I found fine specimens of cedar, and here and
there a birch, and small thickets of wild apple. A hemlock, felled by
Indians for bread-bark, was only twenty inches thick at the butt, a
hundred and twenty feet long, and about five hundred and forty years
old at the time it was felled. The first hundred of its rings measured
only four inches, showing that for a century it had grown in the shade
of taller trees and at the age of one hundred years was yet only a
sapling in size. On the mossy trunk of an old prostrate spruce about a
hundred feet in length thousands of seedlings were growing. I counted
seven hundred on a length of eight feet, so favorable is this climate
for the development of tree seeds and so fully do these trees obey the
command to multiply and replenish the earth. No wonder these islands
are densely clothed with trees. They grow on solid rocks and logs as
well as on fertile soil. The surface is first covered with a plush of
mosses in which the seeds germinate; then the interlacing roots form a
sod, fallen leaves soon cover their feet, and the young trees, closely
crowded together, support each other, and the soil becomes deeper and
richer from year to year.

I greatly enjoyed the Indianâ€™s camp-fire talk this evening on their
ancient customs, how they were taught by their parents ere the whites
came among them, their religion, ideas connected with the next world,
the stars, plants, the behavior and language of animals under different
circumstances, manner of getting a living, etc. When our talk was
interrupted by the howling of a wolf on the opposite side of the
strait, Kadachan puzzled the minister with the question, â€œHave wolves
souls?â€ The Indians believe that they have, giving as foundation for
their belief that they are wise creatures who know how to catch seals
and salmon by swimming slyly upon them with their heads hidden in a
mouthful of grass, hunt deer in company, and always bring forth their
young at the same and most favorable time of the year. I inquired how
it was that with enemies so wise and powerful the deer were not all
killed. Kadachan replied that wolves knew better than to kill them all
and thus cut off their most important food-supply. He said they were
numerous on all the large islands, more so than on the mainland, that
Indian hunters were afraid of them and never ventured far into the
woods alone, for these large gray and black wolves attacked man whether
they were hungry or not. When attacked, the Indian hunter, he said,
climbed a tree or stood with his back against a tree or rock as a wolf
never attacks face to face. Wolves, and not bears, Indians regard as
masters of the woods, for they sometimes attack and kill bears, but the
wolverine they never attack, â€œfor,â€ said John, â€œwolves and wolverines
are companions in sin and equally wicked and cunning.â€

On one of the small islands we found a stockade, sixty by thirty-five
feet, built, our Indians said, by the Kake tribe during one of their
many warlike quarrels. Toyatte and Kadachan said these forts were
common throughout the canoe waters, showing that in this foodful,
kindly wilderness, as in all the world beside, man may be manâ€™s worst
enemy.

We discovered small bits of cultivation here and there, patches of
potatoes and turnips, planted mostly on the cleared sites of deserted
villages. In spring the most industrious families sailed to their
little farms of perhaps a quarter of an acre or less, and ten or
fifteen miles from their villages. After preparing the ground, and
planting it, they visited it again in summer to pull the weeds and
speculate on the size of the crop they were likely to have to eat with
their fat salmon. The Kakes were then busy digging their potatoes,
which they complained were this year injured by early frosts.

We arrived at Klugh-Quan, one of the Kupreanof Kake villages, just as a
funeral party was breaking up. The body had been burned and gifts were
being distributedâ€”bits of calico, handkerchiefs, blankets, etc.,
according to the rank and wealth of the deceased. The death ceremonies
of chiefs and head men, Mr. Young told me, are very weird and imposing,
with wild feasting, dancing, and singing. At this little place there
are some eight totem poles of bold and intricate design, well executed,
but smaller than those of the Stickeens. As elsewhere throughout the
archipelago, the bear, raven, eagle, salmon, and porpoise are the chief
figures. Some of the poles have square cavities, mortised into the
back, which are said to contain the ashes of members of the family.
These recesses are closed by a plug. I noticed one that was caulked
with a rag where the joint was imperfect.

Strolling about the village, looking at the tangled vegetation,
sketching the totems, etc., I found a lot of human bones scattered on
the surface of the ground or partly covered. In answer to my inquiries,
one of our crew said they probably belonged to Sitka Indians, slain in
war. These Kakes are shrewd, industrious, and rather good-looking
people. It was at their largest village that an American schooner was
seized and all the crew except one man murdered. A gunboat sent to
punish them burned the village. I saw the anchor of the ill-fated
vessel lying near the shore.

Though all the Thlinkit tribes believe in witchcraft, they are less
superstitious in some respects than many of the lower classes of
whites. Chief Yana Taowk seemed to take pleasure in kicking the Sitka
bones that lay in his way, and neither old nor young showed the
slightest trace of superstitious fear of the dead at any time.

It was at the northmost of the Kupreanof Kake villages that Mr. Young
held his first missionary meeting, singing hymns, praying, and
preaching, and trying to learn the number of the inhabitants and their
readiness to receive instruction. Neither here nor in any of the other
villages of the different tribes that we visited was there anything
like a distinct refusal to receive school-teachers or ministers. On the
contrary, with but one or two exceptions, all with apparent good faith
declared their willingness to receive them, and many seemed heartily
delighted at the prospect of gaining light on subjects so important and
so dark to them. All had heard ere this of the wonderful work of the
Reverend Mr. Duncan at Metlakatla, and even those chiefs who were not
at all inclined to anything like piety were yet anxious to procure
schools and churches that their people should not miss the temporal
advantages of knowledge, which with their natural shrewdness they were
not slow to recognize. â€œWe are all children,â€ they said, â€œgroping in
the dark. Give us this light and we will do as you bid us.â€

The chief of the first Kupreanof Kake village we came to was a
venerable-looking man, perhaps seventy years old, with massive head and
strongly marked features, a bold Roman nose, deep, tranquil eyes,
shaggy eyebrows, a strong face set in a halo of long gray hair. He
seemed delighted at the prospect of receiving a teacher for his people.
â€œThis is just what I want,â€ he said. â€œI am ready to bid him welcome.â€

â€œThis,â€ said Yana Taowk, chief of the larger north village, â€œis a good
word you bring us. We will be glad to come out of our darkness into
your light. You Boston men must be favorites of the Great Father. You
know all about God, and ships and guns and the growing of things to
eat. We will sit quiet and listen to the words of any teacher you send
us.â€

While Mr. Young was preaching, some of the congregation smoked, talked
to each other, and answered the shouts of their companions outside,
greatly to the disgust of Toyatte and Kadachan, who regarded the Kakes
as mannerless barbarians. A little girl, frightened at the strange
exercises, began to cry and was turned out of doors. She cried in a
strange, low, wild tone, quite unlike the screech crying of the
children of civilization.

[Illustration: Admiralty Island.]

The following morning we crossed Prince Frederick Sound to the west
coast of Admiralty Island. Our frail shell of a canoe was tossed like a
bubble on the swells coming in from the ocean. Still, I suppose, the
danger was not so great as it seemed. In a good canoe, skillfully
handled, you may safely sail from Victoria to Chilcat, a thousand-mile
voyage frequently made by Indians in their trading operations before
the coming of the whites. Our Indians, however, dreaded this crossing
so late in the season. They spoke of it repeatedly before we reached it
as the one great danger of our voyage.

John said to me just as we left the shore, â€œYou and Mr. Young will be
scared to death on this broad water.â€

â€œNever mind us, John,â€ we merrily replied, â€œperhaps some of you brave
Indian sailors may be the first to show fear.â€

Toyatte said he had not slept well a single night thinking of it, and
after we rounded Cape Gardner and entered the comparatively smooth
Chatham Strait, they all rejoiced, laughing and chatting like
frolicsome children.

We arrived at the first of the Hootsenoo villages on Admiralty Island
shortly after noon and were welcomed by everybody. Men, women, and
children made haste to the beach to meet us, the children staring as if
they had never before seen a Boston man. The chief, a remarkably
good-looking and intelligent fellow, stepped forward, shook hands with
us Boston fashion, and invited us to his house. Some of the curious
children crowded in after us and stood around the fire staring like
half-frightened wild animals. Two old women drove them out of the
house, making hideous gestures, but taking good care not to hurt them.
The merry throng poured through the round door, laughing and enjoying
the harsh gestures and threats of the women as all a joke, indicating
mild parental government in general. Indeed, in all my travels I never
saw a child, old or young, receive a blow or even a harsh word. When
our cook began to prepare luncheon our host said through his
interpreter that he was sorry we could not eat Indian food, as he was
anxious to entertain us. We thanked him, of course, and expressed our
sense of his kindness. His brother, in the mean time, brought a dozen
turnips, which he peeled and sliced and served in a clean dish. These
we ate raw as dessert, reminding me of turnip-field feasts when I was a
boy in Scotland. Then a box was brought from some corner and opened. It
seemed to be full of tallow or butter. A sharp stick was thrust into
it, and a lump of something five or six inches long, three or four
wide, and an inch thick was dug up, which proved to be a section of the
back fat of a deer, preserved in fish oil and seasoned with boiled
spruce and other spicy roots. After stripping off the lard-like oil, it
was cut into small pieces and passed round. It seemed white and
wholesome, but I was unable to taste it even for mannerâ€™s sake. This
disgust, however, was not noticed, as the rest of the company did full
justice to the precious tallow and smacked their lips over it as a
great delicacy. A lot of potatoes about the size of walnuts, boiled and
peeled and added to a potful of salmon, made a savory stew that all
seemed to relish. An old, cross-looking, wrinkled crone presided at the
steaming chowder-pot, and as she peeled the potatoes with her fingers
she, at short intervals, quickly thrust one of the best into the mouth
of a little wild-eyed girl that crouched beside her, a spark of natural
love which charmed her withered face and made all the big gloomy house
shine. In honor of our visit, our host put on a genuine white shirt.
His wife also dressed in her best and put a pair of dainty trousers on
her two-year-old boy, who seemed to be the pet and favorite of the
large family and indeed of the whole village. Toward evening messengers
were sent through the village to call everybody to a meeting. Mr. Young
delivered the usual missionary sermon and I also was called on to say
something. Then the chief arose and made an eloquent reply, thanking us
for our good words and for the hopes we had inspired of obtaining a
teacher for their children. In particular, he said, he wanted to hear
all we could tell him about God.

This village was an offshoot of a larger one, ten miles to the north,
called Killisnoo. Under the prevailing patriarchal form of government
each tribe is divided into comparatively few families; and because of
quarrels, the chief of this branch moved his people to this little bay,
where the beach offered a good landing for canoes. A stream which
enters it yields abundance of salmon, while in the adjacent woods and
mountains berries, deer, and wild goats abound.

â€œHere,â€ he said, â€œwe enjoy peace and plenty; all we lack is a church
and a school, particularly a school for the children.â€ His dwelling so
much with benevolent aspect on the children of the tribe showed, I
think, that he truly loved them and had a right intelligent insight
concerning their welfare. We spent the night under his roof, the first
we had ever spent with Indians, and I never felt more at home. The
loving kindness bestowed on the little ones made the house glow.

Next morning, with the hearty good wishes of our Hootsenoo friends, and
encouraged by the gentle weather, we sailed gladly up the coast, hoping
soon to see the Chilcat glaciers in their glory. The rock hereabouts is
mostly a beautiful blue marble, waveworn into a multitude of small
coves and ledges. Fine sections were thus revealed along the shore,
which with their colors, brightened with showers and late-blooming
leaves and flowers, beguiled the weariness of the way. The shingle in
front of these marble cliffs is also mostly marble, well polished and
rounded and mixed with a small percentage of glacier-borne slate and
granite erratics.

We arrived at the upper village about half-past one oâ€™clock. Here we
saw Hootsenoo Indians in a very different light from that which
illumined the lower village. While we were yet half a mile or more
away, we heard sounds I had never before heardâ€”a storm of strange
howls, yells, and screams rising from a base of gasping, bellowing
grunts and groans. Had I been alone, I should have fled as from a pack
of fiends, but our Indians quietly recognized this awful sound, if such
stuff could be called sound, simply as the â€œwhiskey howlâ€ and pushed
quietly on. As we approached the landing, the demoniac howling so
greatly increased I tried to dissuade Mr. Young from attempting to say
a single word in the village, and as for preaching one might as well
try to preach in Tophet. The whole village was afire with bad whiskey.
This was the first time in my life that I learned the meaning of the
phrase â€œa howling drunk.â€ Even our Indians hesitated to venture ashore,
notwithstanding whiskey storms were far from novel to them. Mr. Young,
however, hoped that in this Indian Sodom at least one man might be
found so righteous as to be in his right mind and able to give
trustworthy information. Therefore I was at length prevailed on to
yield consent to land. Our canoe was drawn up on the beach and one of
the crew left to guard it. Cautiously we strolled up the hill to the
main row of houses, now a chain of alcoholic volcanoes. The largest
house, just opposite the landing, was about forty feet square, built of
immense planks, each hewn from a whole log, and, as usual, the only
opening was a mere hole about two and a half feet in diameter, closed
by a massive hinged plug like the breach of a cannon. At the dark
door-hole a few black faces appeared and were suddenly withdrawn. Not a
single person was to be seen on the street. At length a couple of old,
crouching men, hideously blackened, ventured out and stared at us,
then, calling to their companions, other black and burning heads
appeared, and we began to fear that like the Alloway Kirk witches the
whole legion was about to sally forth. But, instead, those outside
suddenly crawled and tumbled in again. We were thus allowed to take a
general view of the place and return to our canoe unmolested. But ere
we could get away, three old women came swaggering and grinning down to
the beach, and Toyatte was discovered by a man with whom he had once
had a business misunderstanding, who, burning for revenge, was now
jumping and howling and threatening as only a drunken Indian may, while
our heroic old captain, in severe icy majesty, stood erect and
motionless, uttering never a word. Kadachan, on the contrary, was well
nigh smothered with the drunken caresses of one of his fatherâ€™s
_tillicums_ (friends), who insisted on his going back with him into the
house. But reversing the words of St. Paul in his account of his
shipwreck, it came to pass that we all at length got safe to sea and by
hard rowing managed to reach a fine harbor before dark, fifteen sweet,
serene miles from the howlers.

Our camp this evening was made at the head of a narrow bay bordered by
spruce and hemlock woods. We made our beds beneath a grand old Sitka
spruce five feet in diameter, whose broad, winglike branches were
outspread immediately above our heads. The night picture as I stood
back to see it in the firelight was this one great tree, relieved
against the gloom of the woods back of it, the light on the low
branches revealing the shining needles, the brown, sturdy trunk
grasping an outswelling mossy bank, and a fringe of illuminated bushes
within a few feet of the tree with the firelight on the tips of the
sprays.

Next morning, soon after we left our harbor, we were caught in a
violent gust of wind and dragged over the seething water in a
passionate hurry, though our sail was close-reefed, flying past the
gray headlands in most exhilarating style, until fear of being capsized
made us drop our sail and run into the first little nook we came to for
shelter. Captain Toyatte remarked that in this kind of wind no Indian
would dream of traveling, but since Mr. Young and I were with him he
was willing to go on, because he was sure that the Lord loved us and
would not allow us to perish.

We were now within a day or two of Chilcat. We had only to hold a
direct course up the beautiful Lynn Canal to reach the large Davidson
and other glaciers at its head in the caÃ±ons of the Chilcat and
Chilcoot Rivers. But rumors of trouble among the Indians there now
reached us. We found a party taking shelter from the stormy wind in a
little cove, who confirmed the bad news that the Chilcats were drinking
and fighting, that Kadachanâ€™s father had been shot, and that it would
be far from safe to venture among them until blood-money had been paid
and the quarrels settled. I decided, therefore, in the mean time, to
turn westward and go in search of the wonderful â€œice-mountainsâ€ that
Sitka Charley had been telling us about. Charley, the youngest of my
crew, noticing my interest in glaciers, said that when he was a boy he
had gone with his father to hunt seals in a large bay full of ice, and
that though it was long since he had been there, he thought he could
find his way to it. Accordingly, we pushed eagerly on across Chatham
Strait to the north end of Icy Strait, toward the new and promising
ice-field.

On the south side of Icy Strait we ran into a picturesque bay to visit
the main village of the Hoona tribe. Rounding a point on the north
shore of the bay, the charmingly located village came in sight, with a
group of the inhabitants gazing at us as we approached. They evidently
recognized us as strangers or visitors from the shape and style of our
canoe, and perhaps even determining that white men were aboard, for
these Indians have wonderful eyes. While we were yet half a mile off,
we saw a flag unfurled on a tall mast in front of the chiefâ€™s house.
Toyatte hoisted his United States flag in reply, and thus arrayed we
made for the landing. Here we were met and received by the chief,
Kashoto, who stood close to the waterâ€™s edge, barefooted and
bareheaded, but wearing so fine a robe and standing so grave, erect,
and serene, his dignity was complete. No white man could have
maintained sound dignity under circumstances so disadvantageous. After
the usual formal salutations, the chief, still standing as erect and
motionless as a tree, said that he was not much acquainted with our
people and feared that his house was too mean for visitors so
distinguished as we were. We hastened of course to assure him that we
were not proud of heart, and would be glad to have the honor of his
hospitality and friendship. With a smile of relief he then led us into
his large fort house to the seat of honor prepared for us. After we had
been allowed to rest unnoticed and unquestioned for fifteen minutes or
so, in accordance with good Indian manners in case we should be weary
or embarrassed, our cook began to prepare luncheon; and the chief
expressed great concern at his not being able to entertain us in Boston
fashion.

Luncheon over, Mr. Young as usual requested him to call his people to a
meeting. Most of them were away at outlying camps gathering winter
stores. Some ten or twelve men, however, about the same number of
women, and a crowd of wondering boys and girls were gathered in, to
whom Mr. Young preached the usual gospel sermon. Toyatte prayed in
Thlinkit, and the other members of the crew joined in the hymn-singing.
At the close of the mission exercises the chief arose and said that he
would now like to hear what the other white chief had to say. I
directed John to reply that I was not a missionary, that I came only to
pay a friendly visit and see the forests and mountains of their
beautiful country. To this he replied, as others had done in the same
circumstances, that he would like to hear me on the subject of their
country and themselves; so I had to get on my feet and make some sort
of a speech, dwelling principally on the brotherhood of all races of
people, assuring them that God loved them and that some of their white
brethren were beginning to know them and become interested in their
welfare; that I seemed this evening to be among old friends with whom I
had long been acquainted, though I had never been here before; that I
would always remember them and the kind reception they had given us;
advised them to heed the instructions of sincere self-denying mission
men who wished only to do them good and desired nothing but their
friendship and welfare in return. I told them that in some far-off
countries, instead of receiving the missionaries with glad and thankful
hearts, the Indians killed and ate them; but I hoped, and indeed felt
sure, that his people would find a better use for missionaries than
putting them, like salmon, in pots for food. They seemed greatly
interested, looking into each otherâ€™s faces with emphatic nods and
a-ahs and smiles.

The chief then slowly arose and, after standing silent a minute or two,
told us how glad he was to see us; that he felt as if his heart had
enjoyed a good meal; that we were the first to come humbly to his
little out-of-the-way village to tell his people about God; that they
were all like children groping in darkness, but eager for light; that
they would gladly welcome a missionary and teacher and use them well;
that he could easily believe that whites and Indians were the children
of one Father just as I had told them in my speech; that they differed
little and resembled each other a great deal, calling attention to the
similarity of hands, eyes, legs, etc., making telling gestures in the
most natural style of eloquence and dignified composure. â€œOftentimes,â€
he said, â€œwhen I was on the high mountains in the fall, hunting wild
sheep for meat, and for wool to make blankets, I have been caught in
snowstorms and held in camp until there was nothing to eat, but when I
reached my home and got warm, and had a good meal, then my body felt
good. For a long time my heart has been hungry and cold, but to-night
your words have warmed my heart, and given it a good meal, and now my
heart feels good.â€

The most striking characteristic of these people is their serene
dignity in circumstances that to us would be novel and embarrassing.
Even the little children behave with natural dignity, come to the white
men when called, and restrain their wonder at the strange prayers,
hymn-singing, etc. This evening an old woman fell asleep in the meeting
and began to snore; and though both old and young were shaken with
suppressed mirth, they evidently took great pains to conceal it. It
seems wonderful to me that these so-called savages can make one feel at
home in their families. In good breeding, intelligence, and skill in
accomplishing whatever they try to do with tools they seem to me to
rank above most of our uneducated white laborers. I have never yet seen
a child ill-used, even to the extent of an angry word. Scolding, so
common a curse in civilization, is not known here at all. On the
contrary the young are fondly indulged without being spoiled. Crying is
very rarely heard.

In the house of this Hoona chief a pet marmot (Parryâ€™s) was a great
favorite with old and young. It was therefore delightfully confiding
and playful and human. Cats were petted, and the confidence with which
these cautious, thoughtful animals met strangers showed that they were
kindly treated.

There were some ten or a dozen houses, all told, in the village. The
count made by the chief for Mr. Young showed some seven hundred and
twenty-five persons in the tribe.




Chapter X
The Discovery of Glacier Bay


From here, on October 24, we set sail for Guide Charleyâ€™s
ice-mountains. The handle of our heaviest axe was cracked, and as
Charley declared that there was no firewood to be had in the big
ice-mountain bay, we would have to load the canoe with a store for
cooking at an island out in the Strait a few miles from the village. We
were therefore anxious to buy or trade for a good sound axe in exchange
for our broken one. Good axes are rare in rocky Alaska. Soon or late an
unlucky stroke on a stone concealed in moss spoils the edge. Finally
one in almost perfect condition was offered by a young Hoona for our
broken-handled one and a half-dollar to boot; but when the broken axe
and money were given he promptly demanded an additional twenty-five
centsâ€™ worth of tobacco. The tobacco was given him, then he required a
half-dollarâ€™s worth more of tobacco, which was also given; but when he
still demanded something more, Charleyâ€™s patience gave way and we
sailed in the same condition as to axes as when we arrived. This was
the only contemptible commercial affair we encountered among these
Alaskan Indians.

We reached the wooded island about one oâ€™clock, made coffee, took on a
store of wood, and set sail direct for the icy country, finding it very
hard indeed to believe the woodless part of Charleyâ€™s description of
the Icy Bay, so heavily and uniformly are all the shores forested
wherever we had been. In this view we were joined by John, Kadachan,
and Toyatte, none of them on all their lifelong canoe travels having
ever seen a woodless country.

We held a northwesterly course until long after dark, when we reached a
small inlet that sets in near the mouth of Glacier Bay, on the west
side. Here we made a cold camp on a desolate snow-covered beach in
stormy sleet and darkness. At daybreak I looked eagerly in every
direction to learn what kind of place we were in; but gloomy
rain-clouds covered the mountains, and I could see nothing that would
give me a clue, while Vancouverâ€™s chart, hitherto a faithful guide,
here failed us altogether. Nevertheless, we made haste to be off; and
fortunately, for just as we were leaving the shore, a faint smoke was
seen across the inlet, toward which Charley, who now seemed lost,
gladly steered. Our sudden appearance so early that gray morning had
evidently alarmed our neighbors, for as soon as we were within hailing
distance an Indian with his face blackened fired a shot over our heads,
and in a blunt, bellowing voice roared, â€œWho are you?â€

Our interpreter shouted, â€œFriends and the Fort Wrangell missionary.â€

Then men, women, and children swarmed out of the hut, and awaited our
approach on the beach. One of the hunters having brought his gun with
him, Kadachan sternly rebuked him, asking with superb indignation
whether he was not ashamed to meet a missionary with a gun in his
hands. Friendly relations, however, were speedily established, and as a
cold rain was falling, they invited us to enter their hut. It seemed
very small and was jammed full of oily boxes and bundles; nevertheless,
twenty-one persons managed to find shelter in it about a smoky fire.
Our hosts proved to be Hoona seal-hunters laying in their winter stores
of meat and skins. The packed hut was passably well ventilated, but its
heavy, meaty smells were not the same to our noses as those we were
accustomed to in the sprucy nooks of the evergreen woods. The circle of
black eyes peering at us through a fog of reek and smoke made a novel
picture. We were glad, however, to get within reach of information, and
of course asked many questions concerning the ice-mountains and the
strange bay, to most of which our inquisitive Hoona friends replied
with counter-questions as to our object in coming to such a place,
especially so late in the year. They had heard of Mr. Young and his
work at Fort Wrangell, but could not understand what a missionary could
be doing in such a place as this. Was he going to preach to the seals
and gulls, they asked, or to the ice-mountains? And could they take his
word? Then John explained that only the friend of the missionary was
seeking ice mountains, that Mr. Young had already preached many good
words in the villages we had visited, their own among the others, that
our hearts were good and every Indian was our friend. Then we gave them
a little rice, sugar, tea, and tobacco, after which they began to gain
confidence and to speak freely. They told us that the big bay was
called by them Sit-a-da-kay, or Ice Bay; that there were many large
ice-mountains in it, but no gold-mines; and that the ice-mountain they
knew best was at the head of the bay, where most of the seals were
found.

Notwithstanding the rain, I was anxious to push on and grope our way
beneath the clouds as best we could, in case worse weather should come;
but Charley was ill at ease, and wanted one of the seal-hunters to go
with us, for the place was much changed. I promised to pay well for a
guide, and in order to lighten the canoe proposed to leave most of our
heavy stores in the hut until our return. After a long consultation one
of them consented to go. His wife got ready his blanket and a piece of
cedar matting for his bed, and some provisionsâ€”mostly dried salmon, and
seal sausage made of strips of lean meat plaited around a core of fat.
She followed us to the beach, and just as we were pushing off said with
a pretty smile, â€œIt is my husband that you are taking away. See that
you bring him back.â€

We got under way about 10 A.M. The wind was in our favor, but a cold
rain pelted us, and we could see but little of the dreary, treeless
wilderness which we had now fairly entered. The bitter blast, however,
gave us good speed; our bedraggled canoe rose and fell on the waves as
solemnly as a big ship. Our course was northwestward, up the southwest
side of the bay, near the shore of what seemed to be the mainland,
smooth marble islands being on our right. About noon we discovered the
first of the great glaciers, the one I afterward named for James
Geikie, the noted Scotch geologist. Its lofty blue cliffs, looming
through the draggled skirts of the clouds, gave a tremendous impression
of savage power, while the roar of the newborn icebergs thickened and
emphasized the general roar of the storm. An hour and a half beyond the
Geikie Glacier we ran into a slight harbor where the shore is low,
dragged the canoe beyond the reach of drifting icebergs, and, much
against my desire to push ahead, encamped, the guide insisting that the
big ice-mountain at the head of the bay could not be reached before
dark, that the landing there was dangerous even in daylight, and that
this was the only safe harbor on the way to it. While camp was being
made. I strolled along the shore to examine the rocks and the fossil
timber that abounds here. All the rocks are freshly glaciated, even
below the sea-level, nor have the waves as yet worn off the surface
polish, much less the heavy scratches and grooves and lines of glacial
contour.

The next day being Sunday, the minister wished to stay in camp; and so,
on account of the weather, did the Indians. I therefore set out on an
excursion, and spent the day alone on the mountain-slopes above the
camp, and northward, to see what I might learn. Pushing on through rain
and mud and sludgy snow, crossing many brown, boulder-choked torrents,
wading, jumping, and wallowing in snow up to my shoulders was
mountaineering of the most trying kind. After crouching cramped and
benumbed in the canoe, poulticed in wet or damp clothing night and day,
my limbs had been asleep. This day they were awakened and in the hour
of trial proved that they had not lost the cunning learned on many a
mountain peak of the High Sierra. I reached a height of fifteen hundred
feet, on the ridge that bounds the second of the great glaciers. All
the landscape was smothered in clouds and I began to fear that as far
as wide views were concerned I had climbed in vain. But at length the
clouds lifted a little, and beneath their gray fringes I saw the
berg-filled expanse of the bay, and the feet of the mountains that
stand about it, and the imposing fronts of five huge glaciers, the
nearest being immediately beneath me. This was my first general view of
Glacier Bay, a solitude of ice and snow and newborn rocks, dim, dreary,
mysterious. I held the ground I had so dearly won for an hour or two,
sheltering myself from the blast as best I could, while with benumbed
fingers I sketched what I could see of the landscape, and wrote a few
lines in my notebook. Then, breasting the snow again, crossing the
shifting avalanche slopes and torrents, I reached camp about dark, wet
and weary and glad.

While I was getting some coffee and hardtack, Mr. Young told me that
the Indians were discouraged, and had been talking about turning back,
fearing that I would be lost, the canoe broken, or in some other
mysterious way the expedition would come to grief if I persisted in
going farther. They had been asking him what possible motive I could
have in climbing mountains when storms were blowing; and when he
replied that I was only seeking knowledge, Toyatte said, â€œMuir must be
a witch to seek knowledge in such a place as this and in such miserable
weather.â€

After supper, crouching about a dull fire of fossil wood, they became
still more doleful, and talked in tones that accorded well with the
wind and waters and growling torrents about us, telling sad old stories
of crushed canoes, drowned Indians, and hunters frozen in snowstorms.
Even brave old Toyatte, dreading the treeless, forlorn appearance of
the region, said that his heart was not strong, and that he feared his
canoe, on the safety of which our lives depended, might be entering a
skookum-house (jail) of ice, from which there might be no escape; while
the Hoona guide said bluntly that if I was so fond of danger, and meant
to go close up to the noses of the ice-mountains, he would not consent
to go any farther; for we should all be lost, as many of his tribe had
been, by the sudden rising of bergs from the bottom. They seemed to be
losing heart with every howl of the wind, and, fearing that they might
fail me now that I was in the midst of so grand a congregation of
glaciers, I made haste to reassure them, telling them that for ten
years I had wandered alone among mountains and storms, and good luck
always followed me; that with me, therefore, they need fear nothing.
The storm would soon cease and the sun would shine to show us the way
we should go, for God cares for us and guides us as long as we are
trustful and brave, therefore all childish fear must be put away. This
little speech did good. Kadachan, with some show of enthusiasm, said he
liked to travel with good-luck people; and dignified old Toyatte
declared that now his heart was strong again, and he would venture on
with me as far as I liked for my â€œwawaâ€ was â€œdelaitâ€ (my talk was very
good). The old warrior even became a little sentimental, and said that
even if the canoe was broken he would not greatly care, because on the
way to the other world he would have good companions.

Next morning it was still raining and snowing, but the south wind swept
us bravely forward and swept the bergs from our course. In about an
hour we reached the second of the big glaciers, which I afterwards
named for Hugh Miller. We rowed up its fiord and landed to make a
slight examination of its grand frontal wall. The berg-producing
portion we found to be about a mile and a half wide, and broken into an
imposing array of jagged spires and pyramids, and flat-topped towers
and battlements, of many shades of blue, from pale, shimmering, limpid
tones in the crevasses and hollows, to the most startling, chilling,
almost shrieking vitriol blue on the plain mural spaces from which
bergs had just been discharged. Back from the front for a few miles the
glacier rises in a series of wide steps, as if this portion of the
glacier had sunk in successive sections as it reached deep water, and
the sea had found its way beneath it. Beyond this it extends
indefinitely in a gently rising prairie-like expanse, and branches
along the slopes and caÃ±ons of the Fairweather Range.

From here a run of two hours brought us to the head of the bay, and to
the mouth of the northwest fiord, at the head of which lie the Hoona
sealing-grounds, and the great glacier now called the Pacific, and
another called the Hoona. The fiord is about five miles long, and two
miles wide at the mouth. Here our Hoona guide had a store of dry wood,
which we took aboard. Then, setting sail, we were driven wildly up the
fiord, as if the storm-wind were saying, â€œGo, then, if you will, into
my icy chamber; but you shall stay in until I am ready to let you out.â€
All this time sleety rain was falling on the bay, and snow on the
mountains; but soon after we landed the sky began to open. The camp was
made on a rocky bench near the front of the Pacific Glacier, and the
canoe was carried beyond the reach of the bergs and berg-waves. The
bergs were now crowded in a dense pack against the discharging front,
as if the storm-wind had determined to make the glacier take back her
crystal offspring and keep them at home.

While camp affairs were being attended to, I set out to climb a
mountain for comprehensive views; and before I had reached a height of
a thousand feet the rain ceased, and the clouds began to rise from the
lower altitudes, slowly lifting their white skirts, and lingering in
majestic, wing-shaped masses about the mountains that rise out of the
broad, icy sea, the highest of all the white mountains, and the
greatest of all the glaciers I had yet seen. Climbing higher for a
still broader outlook, I made notes and sketched, improving the
precious time while sunshine streamed through the luminous fringes of
the clouds and fell on the green waters of the fiord, the glittering
bergs, the crystal bluffs of the vast glacier, the intensely white,
far-spreading fields of ice, and the ineffably chaste and spiritual
heights of the Fairweather Range, which were now hidden, now partly
revealed, the whole making a picture of icy wildness unspeakably pure
and sublime.

Looking southward, a broad ice-sheet was seen extending in a gently
undulating plain from the Pacific Fiord in the foreground to the
horizon, dotted and ridged here and there with mountains which were as
white as the snow-covered ice in which they were half, or more than
half, submerged. Several of the great glaciers of the bay flow from
this one grand fountain. It is an instructive example of a general
glacier covering the hills and dales of a country that is not yet ready
to be brought to the light of dayâ€”not only covering but creating a
landscape with the features it is destined to have when, in the
fullness of time, the fashioning ice-sheet shall be lifted by the sun,
and the land become warm and fruitful. The view to the westward is
bounded and almost filled by the glorious Fairweather Mountains, the
highest among them springing aloft in sublime beauty to a height of
nearly sixteen thousand feet, while from base to summit every peak and
spire and dividing ridge of all the mighty host was spotless white, as
if painted. It would seem that snow could never be made to lie on the
steepest slopes and precipices unless plastered on when wet, and then
frozen. But this snow could not have been wet. It must have been fixed
by being driven and set in small particles like the storm-dust of
drifts, which, when in this condition, is fixed not only on sheer
cliffs, but in massive, overcurling cornices. Along the base of this
majestic range sweeps the Pacific Glacier, fed by innumerable cascading
tributaries, and discharging into the head of its fiord by two mouths
only partly separated by the brow of an island rock about one thousand
feet high, each nearly a mile wide.

Dancing down the mountain to camp, my mind glowing like the sunbeaten
glaciers, I found the Indians seated around a good fire, entirely happy
now that the farthest point of the journey was safely reached and the
long, dark storm was cleared away. How hopefully, peacefully bright
that night were the stars in the frosty sky, and how impressive was the
thunder of the icebergs, rolling, swelling, reverberating through the
solemn stillness! I was too happy to sleep.

About daylight next morning we crossed the fiord and landed on the
south side of the rock that divides the wall of the great glacier. The
whiskered faces of seals dotted the open spaces between the bergs, and
I could not prevent John and Charley and Kadachan from shooting at
them. Fortunately, few, if any, were hurt. Leaving the Indians in
charge of the canoe, I managed to climb to the top of the wall by a
good deal of step-cutting between the ice and dividing rock, and gained
a good general view of the glacier. At one favorable place I descended
about fifty feet below the side of the glacier, where its denuding,
fashioning action was clearly shown. Pushing back from here, I found
the surface crevassed and sunken in steps, like the Hugh Miller
Glacier, as if it were being undermined by the action of tide-waters.
For a distance of fifteen or twenty miles the river-like ice-flood is
nearly level, and when it recedes, the ocean water will follow it, and
thus form a long extension of the fiord, with features essentially the
same as those now extending into the continent farther south, where
many great glaciers once poured into the sea, though scarce a vestige
of them now exists. Thus the domain of the sea has been, and is being,
extended in these ice-sculptured lands, and the scenery of their shores
enriched. The brow of the dividing rock is about a thousand feet high,
and is hard beset by the glacier. A short time ago it was at least two
thousand feet below the surface of the over-sweeping ice; and under
present climatic conditions it will soon take its place as a
glacier-polished island in the middle of the fiord, like a thousand
others in the magnificent archipelago. Emerging from its icy sepulchre,
it gives a most telling illustration of the birth of a marked feature
of a landscape. In this instance it is not the mountain, but the
glacier, that is in labor, and the mountain itself is being brought
forth.

The Hoona Glacier enters the fiord on the south side, a short distance
below the Pacific, displaying a broad and far-reaching expanse, over
which many lofty peaks are seen; but the front wall, thrust into the
fiord, is not nearly so interesting as that of the Pacific, and I did
not observe any bergs discharged from it.

In the evening, after witnessing the unveiling of the majestic peaks
and glaciers and their baptism in the down-pouring sunbeams, it seemed
inconceivable that nature could have anything finer to show us.
Nevertheless, compared with what was to come the next morning, all that
was as nothing. The calm dawn gave no promise of anything uncommon. Its
most impressive features were the frosty clearness of the sky and a
deep, brooding stillness made all the more striking by the thunder of
the newborn bergs. The sunrise we did not see at all, for we were
beneath the shadows of the fiord cliffs; but in the midst of our
studies, while the Indians were getting ready to sail, we were startled
by the sudden appearance of a red light burning with a strange
unearthly splendor on the topmost peak of the Fairweather Mountains.
Instead of vanishing as suddenly as it had appeared, it spread and
spread until the whole range down to the level of the glaciers was
filled with the celestial fire. In color it was at first a vivid
crimson, with a thick, furred appearance, as fine as the alpenglow, yet
indescribably rich and deepâ€”not in the least like a garment or mere
external flush or bloom through which one might expect to see the rocks
or snow, but every mountain apparently was glowing from the heart like
molten metal fresh from a furnace. Beneath the frosty shadows of the
fiord we stood hushed and awe-stricken, gazing at the holy vision; and
had we seen the heavens opened and God made manifest, our attention
could not have been more tremendously strained. When the highest peak
began to burn, it did not seem to be steeped in sunshine, however
glorious, but rather as if it had been thrust into the body of the sun
itself. Then the supernal fire slowly descended, with a sharp line of
demarcation separating it from the cold, shaded region beneath; peak
after peak, with their spires and ridges and cascading glaciers, caught
the heavenly glow, until all the mighty host stood transfigured,
hushed, and thoughtful, as if awaiting the coming of the Lord. The
white, rayless light of morning, seen when I was alone amid the peaks
of the California Sierra, had always seemed to me the most telling of
all the terrestrial manifestations of God. But here the mountains
themselves were made divine, and declared His glory in terms still more
impressive. How long we gazed I never knew. The glorious vision passed
away in a gradual, fading change through a thousand tones of color to
pale yellow and white, and then the work of the ice-world went on again
in everyday beauty. The green waters of the fiord were filled with
sun-spangles; the fleet of icebergs set forth on their voyages with the
upspringing breeze; and on the innumerable mirrors and prisms of these
bergs, and on those of the shattered crystal walls of the glaciers,
common white light and rainbow light began to burn, while the mountains
shone in their frosty jewelry, and loomed again in the thin azure in
serene terrestrial majesty. We turned and sailed away, joining the
outgoing bergs, while â€œGloria in excelsisâ€ still seemed to be sounding
over all the white landscape, and our burning hearts were ready for any
fate, feeling that, whatever the future might have in store, the
treasures we had gained this glorious morning would enrich our lives
forever.

When we arrived at the mouth of the fiord, and rounded the massive
granite headland that stands guard at the entrance on the north side,
another large glacier, now named the Reid, was discovered at the head
of one of the northern branches of the bay. Pushing ahead into this new
fiord, we found that it was not only packed with bergs, but that the
spaces between the bergs were crusted with new ice, compelling us to
turn back while we were yet several miles from the discharging frontal
wall. But though we were not then allowed to set foot on this
magnificent glacier, we obtained a fine view of it, and I made the
Indians cease rowing while I sketched its principal features. Thence,
after steering northeastward a few miles, we discovered still another
large glacier, now named the Carroll. But the fiord into which this
glacier flows was, like the last, utterly inaccessible on account of
ice, and we had to be content with a general view and sketch of it,
gained as we rowed slowly past at a distance of three or four miles.
The mountains back of it and on each side of its inlet are sculptured
in a singularly rich and striking style of architecture, in which
subordinate peaks and gables appear in wonderful profusion, and an
imposing conical mountain with a wide, smooth base stands out in the
main current of the glacier, a mile or two back from the discharging
ice-wall.

We now turned southward down the eastern shore of the bay, and in an
hour or two discovered a glacier of the second class, at the head of a
comparatively short fiord that winter had not yet closed. Here we
landed, and climbed across a mile or so of rough boulder-beds, and back
upon the wildly broken, receding front of the glacier, which, though it
descends to the level of the sea, no longer sends off bergs. Many large
masses, detached from the wasting front by irregular melting, were
partly buried beneath mud, sand, gravel, and boulders of the terminal
moraine. Thus protected, these fossil icebergs remain unmelted for many
years, some of them for a century or more, as shown by the age of trees
growing above them, though there are no trees here as yet. At length
melting, a pit with sloping sides is formed by the falling in of the
overlying moraine material into the space at first occupied by the
buried ice. In this way are formed the curious depressions in
drift-covered regions called kettles or sinks. On these decaying
glaciers we may also find many interesting lessons on the formation of
boulders and boulder-beds, which in all glaciated countries exert a
marked influence on scenery, health, and fruitfulness.

Three or four miles farther down the bay, we came to another fiord, up
which we sailed in quest of more glaciers, discovering one in each of
the two branches into which the fiord divides. Neither of these
glaciers quite reaches tide-water. Notwithstanding the apparent
fruitfulness of their fountains, they are in the first stage of
decadence, the waste from melting and evaporation being greater now
than the supply of new ice from their snowy fountains. We reached the
one in the north branch, climbed over its wrinkled brow, and gained a
good view of the trunk and some of the tributaries, and also of the
sublime gray cliffs of its channel.

Then we sailed up the south branch of the inlet, but failed to reach
the glacier there, on account of a thin sheet of new ice. With the
tent-poles we broke a lane for the canoe for a little distance; but it
was slow work, and we soon saw that we could not reach the glacier
before dark. Nevertheless, we gained a fair view of it as it came
sweeping down through its gigantic gateway of massive Yosemite rocks
three or four thousand feet high. Here we lingered until sundown,
gazing and sketching; then turned back, and encamped on a bed of
cobblestones between the forks of the fiord.

We gathered a lot of fossil wood and after supper made a big fire, and
as we sat around it the brightness of the sky brought on a long talk
with the Indians about the stars; and their eager, childlike attention
was refreshing to see as compared with the deathlike apathy of weary
town-dwellers, in whom natural curiosity has been quenched in toil and
care and poor shallow comfort.

After sleeping a few hours, I stole quietly out of the camp, and
climbed the mountain that stands between the two glaciers. The ground
was frozen, making the climbing difficult in the steepest places; but
the views over the icy bay, sparkling beneath the stars, were
enchanting. It seemed then a sad thing that any part of so precious a
night had been lost in sleep. The starlight was so full that I
distinctly saw not only the berg-filled bay, but most of the lower
portions of the glaciers, lying pale and spirit-like amid the
mountains. The nearest glacier in particular was so distinct that it
seemed to be glowing with light that came from within itself. Not even
in dark nights have I ever found any difficulty in seeing large
glaciers; but on this mountain-top, amid so much ice, in the heart of
so clear and frosty a night, everything was more or less luminous, and
I seemed to be poised in a vast hollow between two skies of almost
equal brightness. This exhilarating scramble made me glad and strong
and I rejoiced that my studies called me before the glorious night
succeeding so glorious a morning had been spent!

I got back to camp in time for an early breakfast, and by daylight we
had everything packed and were again under way. The fiord was frozen
nearly to its mouth, and though the ice was so thin it gave us but
little trouble in breaking a way for the canoe, yet it showed us that
the season for exploration in these waters was well-nigh over. We were
in danger of being imprisoned in a jam of icebergs, for the
water-spaces between them freeze rapidly, binding the floes into one
mass. Across such floes it would be almost impossible to drag a canoe,
however industriously we might ply the axe, as our Hoona guide took
great pains to warn us. I would have kept straight down the bay from
here, but the guide had to be taken home, and the provisions we left at
the bark hut had to be got on board. We therefore crossed over to our
Sunday storm-camp, cautiously boring a way through the bergs. We found
the shore lavishly adorned with a fresh arrival of assorted bergs that
had been left stranded at high tide. They were arranged in a curving
row, looking intensely clear and pure on the gray sand, and, with the
sunbeams pouring through them, suggested the jewel-paved streets of the
New Jerusalem.

On our way down the coast, after examining the front of the beautiful
Geikie Glacier, we obtained our first broad view of the great glacier
afterwards named the Muir, the last of all the grand company to be
seen, the stormy weather having hidden it when we first entered the
bay. It was now perfectly clear, and the spacious, prairie-like
glacier, with its many tributaries extending far back into the snowy
recesses of its fountains, made a magnificent display of its wealth,
and I was strongly tempted to go and explore it at all hazards. But
winter had come, and the freezing of its fiords was an insurmountable
obstacle. I had, therefore, to be content for the present with
sketching and studying its main features at a distance.

[Illustration: The Muir Glacier in the Seventies, showing Ice Cliffs
and Stranded Icebergs.]

When we arrived at the Hoona hunting-camp, men, women, and children
came swarming out to welcome us. In the neighborhood of this camp I
carefully noted the lines of demarkation between the forested and
deforested regions. Several mountains here are only in part deforested,
and the lines separating the bare and the forested portions are well
defined. The soil, as well as the trees, had slid off the steep slopes,
leaving the edge of the woods raw-looking and rugged.

At the mouth of the bay a series of moraine islands show that the trunk
glacier that occupied the bay halted here for some time and deposited
this island material as a terminal moraine; that more of the bay was
not filled in shows that, after lingering here, it receded
comparatively fast. All the level portions of trunks of glaciers
occupying ocean fiords, instead of melting back gradually in times of
general shrinking and recession, as inland glaciers with sloping
channels do, melt almost uniformly over all the surface until they
become thin enough to float. Then, of course, with each rise and fall
of the tide, the sea water, with a temperature usually considerably
above the freezing-point, rushes in and out beneath them, causing rapid
waste of the nether surface, while the upper is being wasted by the
weather, until at length the fiord portions of these great glaciers
become comparatively thin and weak and are broken up and vanish almost
simultaneously.

Glacier Bay is undoubtedly young as yet. Vancouverâ€™s chart, made only a
century ago, shows no trace of it, though found admirably faithful in
general. It seems probable, therefore, that even then the entire bay
was occupied by a glacier of which all those described above, great
though they are, were only tributaries. Nearly as great a change has
taken place in Sum Dum Bay since Vancouverâ€™s visit, the main trunk
glacier there having receded from eighteen to twenty five miles from
the line marked on his chart. Charley, who was here when a boy, said
that the place had so changed that he hardly recognized it, so many new
islands had been born in the mean time and so much ice had vanished. As
we have seen, this Icy Bay is being still farther extended by the
recession of the glaciers. That this whole system of fiords and
channels was added to the domain of the sea by glacial action is to my
mind certain.

We reached the island from which we had obtained our store of fuel
about half-past six and camped here for the night, having spent only
five days in Sitadaka, sailing round it, visiting and sketching all the
six glaciers excepting the largest, though I landed only on three of
them,â€”the Geikie, Hugh Miller, and Grand Pacific,â€”the freezing of the
fiords in front of the others rendering them inaccessible at this late
season.




Chapter XI
The Country of the Chilcats


On October 30 we visited a camp of Hoonas at the mouth of a
salmon-chuck. We had seen some of them before, and they received us
kindly. Here we learned that peace reigned in Chilcat. The reports that
we had previously heard were, as usual in such cases, wildly
exaggerated. The little camp hut of these Indians was crowded with the
food-supplies they had gatheredâ€”chiefly salmon, dried and tied in
bunches of convenient size for handling and transporting to their
villages, bags of salmon-roe, boxes of fish-oil, a lot of mountain-goat
mutton, and a few porcupines. They presented us with some dried salmon
and potatoes, for which we gave them tobacco and rice. About 3 P.M. we
reached their village, and in the best house, that of a chief, we found
the family busily engaged in making whiskey. The still and mash were
speedily removed and hidden away with apparent shame as soon as we came
in sight. When we entered and passed the regular greetings, the usual
apologies as to being unable to furnish Boston food for us and
inquiries whether we could eat Indian food were gravely made. Toward
six or seven oâ€™clock Mr. Young explained the object of his visit and
held a short service. The chief replied with grave deliberation, saying
that he would be heartily glad to have a teacher sent to his poor
ignorant people, upon whom he now hoped the light of a better day was
beginning to break. Hereafter he would gladly do whatever the white
teachers told him to do and would have no will of his own. This under
the whiskey circumstances seemed too good to be quite true. He thanked
us over and over again for coming so far to see him, and complained
that Port Simpson Indians, sent out on a missionary tour by Mr. Crosby,
after making a good-luck board for him and nailing it over his door,
now wanted to take it away. Mr. Young promised to make him a new one,
should this threat be executed, and remarked that since he had offered
to do his bidding he hoped he would make no more whiskey. To this the
chief replied with fresh complaints concerning the threatened loss of
his precious board, saying that he thought the Port Simpson Indians
were very mean in seeking to take it away, but that now he would tell
them to take it as soon as they liked for he was going to get a better
one at Wrangell. But no effort of the missionary could bring him to
notice or discuss the whiskey business. The luck board nailed over the
door was about two feet long and had the following inscription: â€œThe
Lord will bless those who do his will. When you rise in the morning,
and when you retire at night, give him thanks. Heccla Hockla Popla.â€

This chief promised to pray like a white man every morning, and to bury
the dead as the whites do. â€œI often wondered,â€ he said, â€œwhere the dead
went to. Now I am glad to knowâ€; and at last acknowledged the whiskey,
saying he was sorry to have been caught making the bad stuff. The
behavior of all, even the little ones circled around the fire, was very
good. There was no laughter when the strange singing commenced. They
only gazed like curious, intelligent animals. A little daughter of the
chief with the glow of the firelight on her eyes made an interesting
picture, head held aslant. Another in the group, with upturned eyes,
seeming to half understand the strange words about God, might have
passed for one of Raphaelâ€™s angels.

The chiefâ€™s house was about forty feet square, of the ordinary fort
kind, but better built and cleaner than usual. The side-room doors were
neatly paneled, though all the lumber had been nibbled into shape with
a small narrow Indian adze. We had our tent pitched on a grassy spot
near the beach, being afraid of wee beasties; which greatly offended
Kadachan and old Toyatte, who said, â€œIf this is the way you are to do
up at Chilcat, we will be ashamed of you.â€ We promised them to eat
Indian food and in every way behave like good Chilcats.

We set out direct for Chilcat in the morning against a brisk head wind.
By keeping close inshore and working hard, we made about ten miles by
two or three oâ€™clock, when, the tide having turned against us, we could
make scarce any headway, and therefore landed in a sheltered cove a few
miles up the west side of Lynn Canal. Here I discovered a fine growth
of yellow cedar, but none of the trees were very large, the tallest
only seventy-five to one hundred feet high. The flat, drooping,
plume-like branchlets hang edgewise, giving the trees a thin, open,
airy look. Nearly every tree that I saw in a long walk was more or less
marked by the knives and axes of the Indians, who use the bark for
matting, for covering house-roofs, and making temporary portable huts.
For this last purpose sections five or six feet long and two or three
wide are pressed flat and secured from warping or splitting by binding
them with thin strips of wood at the end. These they carry about with
them in their canoes, and in a few minutes they can be put together
against slim poles and made into a rainproof hut. Every paddle that I
have seen along the coast is made of the light, tough, handsome yellow
wood of this tree. It is a tree of moderately rapid growth and usually
chooses ground that is rather boggy and mossy. Whether its network of
roots makes the bog or not, I am unable as yet to say.

Three glaciers on the opposite side of the canal were in sight,
descending nearly to sea-level, and many smaller ones that melt a
little below timber-line. While I was sketching these, a canoe hove in
sight, coming on at a flying rate of speed before the wind. The owners,
eager for news, paid us a visit. They proved to be Hoonas, a man, his
wife, and four children, on their way home from Chilcat. The man was
sitting in the stern steering and holding a sleeping child in his arms.
Another lay asleep at his feet. He told us that Sitka Jack had gone up
to the main Chilcat village the day before he left, intending to hold a
grand feast and potlatch, and that whiskey up there was flowing like
water. The news was rather depressing to Mr. Young and myself, for we
feared the effect of the poison on Toyatteâ€™s old enemies. At 8.30 P.M.
we set out again on the turn of the tide, though the crew did not
relish this night work. Naturally enough, they liked to stay in camp
when wind and tide were against us, but didnâ€™t care to make up lost
time after dark however wooingly wind and tide might flow and blow.
Kadachan, John, and Charley rowed, and Toyatte steered and paddled,
assisted now and then by me. The wind moderated and almost died away,
so that we made about fifteen miles in six hours, when the tide turned
and snow began to fall. We ran into a bay nearly opposite Bernerâ€™s Bay,
where three or four families of Chilcats were camped who shouted when
they heard us landing and demanded our names. Our men ran to the huts
for news before making camp. The Indians proved to be hunters, who said
there were plenty of wild sheep on the mountains back a few miles from
the head of the bay. This interview was held at three oâ€™clock in the
morning, a rather early hour. But Indians never resent any such
disturbance provided there is anything worth while to be said or done.
By four oâ€™clock we had our tents set, a fire made and some coffee,
while the snow was falling fast. Toyatte was out of humor with this
night business. He wanted to land an hour or two before we did, and
then, when the snow began to fall and we all wanted to find a
camping-ground as soon as possible, he steered out into the middle of
the canal, saying grimly that the tide was good. He turned, however, at
our orders, but read us a lecture at the first opportunity, telling us
to start early if we were in a hurry, but not to travel in the night
like thieves.

After a few hoursâ€™ sleep, we set off again, with the wind still against
us and the sea rough. We were all tired after making only about twelve
miles, and camped in a rocky nook where we found a family of Hoonas in
their bark hut beside their canoe. They presented us with potatoes and
salmon and a big bucketful of berries, salmon-roe, and grease of some
sort, probably fish-oil, which the crew consumed with wonderful relish.

A fine breeze was blowing next morning from the south, which would take
us to Chilcat in a few hours, but unluckily the day was Sunday and the
good wind was refused. Sunday, it seemed to me, could be kept as well
by sitting in the canoe and letting the Lordâ€™s wind waft us quietly on
our way. The day was rainy and the clouds hung low. The trees here are
remarkably well developed, tall and straight. I observed three or four
hemlocks which had been struck by lightning,â€”the first I noticed in
Alaska. Some of the species on windy outjutting rocks become very
picturesque, almost as much so as old oaks, the foliage becoming dense
and the branchlets tufted in heavy plume-shaped horizontal masses.

Monday was a fine clear day, but the wind was dead ahead, making hard,
dull work with paddles and oars. We passed a long stretch of beautiful
marble cliffs enlivened with small merry waterfalls, and toward noon
came in sight of the front of the famous Chilcat or Davidson Glacier, a
broad white flood reaching out two or three miles into the canal with
wonderful effect. I wanted to camp beside it but the head wind tired us
out before we got within six or eight miles of it. We camped on the
west side of a small rocky island in a narrow cove. When I was looking
among the rocks and bushes for a smooth spot for a bed, I found a human
skeleton. My Indians seemed not in the least shocked or surprised,
explaining that it was only the remains of a Chilcat slave. Indians
never bury or burn the bodies of slaves, but just cast them away
anywhere. Kind Nature was covering the poor bones with moss and leaves,
and I helped in the pitiful work.

The wind was fair and joyful in the morning, and away we glided to the
famous glacier. In an hour or so we were directly in front of it and
beheld it in all its crystal glory descending from its white mountain
fountains and spreading out in an immense fan three or four miles wide
against its tree-fringed terminal moraine. But, large as it is, it long
ago ceased to discharge bergs.

The Chilcats are the most influential of all the Thlinkit tribes.
Whenever on our journey I spoke of the interesting characteristics of
other tribes we had visited, my crew would invariably say, â€œOh, yes,
these are pretty good Indians, but wait till you have seen the
Chilcats.â€ We were now only five or six miles distant from their lower
village, and my crew requested time to prepare themselves to meet their
great rivals. Going ashore on the moraine with their boxes that had not
been opened since we left Fort Wrangell, they sat on boulders and cut
each otherâ€™s hair, carefully washed and perfumed themselves and made a
complete change in their clothing, even to white shirts, new boots, new
hats, and bright neckties. Meanwhile, I scrambled across the broad,
brushy, forested moraine, and on my return scarcely recognized my crew
in their dress suits. Mr. Young also made some changes in his clothing,
while I, having nothing dressy in my bag, adorned my cap with an
eagleâ€™s feather I found on the moraine, and thus arrayed we set forth
to meet the noble Thlinkits.

We were discovered while we were several miles from the village, and as
we entered the mouth of the river we were hailed by a messenger from
the chief, sent to find out who we were and the objects of our
extraordinary visit.

â€œWho are you?â€ he shouted in a heavy, far-reaching voice. â€œWhat are
your names? What do you want? What have you come for?â€

On receiving replies, he shouted the information to another messenger,
who was posted on the river-bank at a distance of a quarter of a mile
or so, and he to another and another in succession, and by this living
telephone the news was delivered to the chief as he sat by his
fireside. A salute was then fired to welcome us, and a swarm of
musket-bullets, flying scarce high enough for comfort, pinged over our
heads. As soon as we reached the landing at the village, a dignified
young man stepped forward and thus addressed us:â€”

â€œMy chief sent me to meet you, and to ask if you would do him the honor
to lodge in his house during your stay in our village?â€

We replied, of course, that we would consider it a great honor to be
entertained by so distinguished a chief.

The messenger then ordered a number of slaves, who stood behind him, to
draw our canoe out of the water, carry our provisions and bedding into
the chiefâ€™s house, and then carry the canoe back from the river where
it would be beyond the reach of floating ice. While we waited, a lot of
boys and girls were playing on a meadow near the landingâ€”running races,
shooting arrows, and wading in the icy river without showing any
knowledge of our presence beyond quick stolen glances. After all was
made secure, he conducted us to the house, where we found seats of
honor prepared for us.

The old chief sat barefooted by the fireside, clad in a calico shirt
and blanket, looking down, and though we shook hands as we passed him
he did not look up. After we were seated, he still gazed into the fire
without taking the slightest notice of us for about ten or fifteen
minutes. The various members of the chiefâ€™s family, also,â€”men, women,
and children,â€”went about their usual employment and play as if entirely
unconscious that strangers were in the house, it being considered
impolite to look at visitors or speak to them before time had been
allowed them to collect their thoughts and prepare any message they
might have to deliver.

At length, after the politeness period had passed, the chief slowly
raised his head and glanced at his visitors, looked down again, and at
last said, through our interpreter:â€”

â€œI am troubled. It is customary when strangers visit us to offer them
food in case they might be hungry, and I was about to do so, when I
remembered that the food of you honorable white chiefs is so much
better than mine that I am ashamed to offer it.â€

We, of course, replied that we would consider it a great honor to enjoy
the hospitality of so distinguished a chief as he was.

Hearing this, he looked up, saying, â€œI feel relievedâ€; or, in John the
interpreterâ€™s words, â€œHe feels good now, he says he feels good.â€

He then ordered one of his family to see that the visitors were fed.
The young man who was to act as steward took up his position in a
corner of the house commanding a view of all that was going on, and
ordered the slaves to make haste to prepare a good meal; one to bring a
lot of the best potatoes from the cellar and wash them well; another to
go out and pick a basketful of fresh berries; another to broil a
salmon; while others made a suitable fire, pouring oil on the wet wood
to make it blaze. Speedily the feast was prepared and passed around.
The first course was potatoes, the second fish-oil and salmon, next
berries and rose-hips; then the steward shouted the important news, in
a loud voice like a herald addressing an army, â€œThatâ€™s all!â€ and left
his post.

Then followed all sorts of questions from the old chief. He wanted to
know what Professor Davidson had been trying to do a year or two ago on
a mountain-top back of the village, with many strange things looking at
the sun when it grew dark in the daytime; and we had to try to explain
eclipses. He asked us if we could tell him what made the water rise and
fall twice a day, and we tried to explain that the sun and moon
attracted the sea by showing how a magnet attracted iron.

Mr. Young, as usual, explained the object of his visit and requested
that the people might be called together in the evening to hear his
message. Accordingly all were told to wash, put on their best clothing,
and come at a certain hour. There was an audience of about two hundred
and fifty, to whom Mr. Young I preached. Toyatte led in prayer, while
Kadachan and John joined in the singing of several hymns. At the
conclusion of the religious exercises the chief made a short address of
thanks, and finished with a request for the message of the other chief.
I again tried in vain to avoid a speech by telling the interpreter to
explain that I was only traveling to see the country, the glaciers, and
mountains and forests, etc., but these subjects, strange to say, seemed
to be about as interesting as the gospel, and I had to delivery sort of
lecture on the fine foodful country God had given them and the
brotherhood of man, along the same general lines I had followed at
other villages. Some five similar meetings were held here, two of them
in the daytime, and we began to feel quite at home in the big
block-house with our hospitable and warlike friends.

At the last meeting an old white-haired shaman of grave and venerable
aspect, with a high wrinkled forehead, big, strong Roman nose and
light-colored skin, slowly and with great dignity arose and spoke for
the first time.

â€œI am an old man,â€ he said, â€œbut I am glad to listen to those strange
things you tell, and they may well be true, for what is more wonderful
than the flight of birds in the air? I remember the first white man I
ever saw. Since that long, long-ago time I have seen many, but never
until now have I ever truly known and felt a white manâ€™s heart. All the
white men I have heretofore met wanted to get something from us. They
wanted furs and they wished to pay for them as small a price as
possible. They all seemed to be seeking their own goodâ€”not our good. I
might say that through all my long life I have never until now heard a
white man speak. It has always seemed to me while trying to speak to
traders and those seeking gold-mines that it was like speaking to a
person across a broad stream that was running fast over stones and
making so loud a noise that scarce a single word could be heard. But
now, for the first time, the Indian and the white man are on the same
side of the river, eye to eye, heart to heart. I have always loved my
people. I have taught them and ministered to them as well as I could.
Hereafter, I will keep silent and listen to the good words of the
missionaries, who know God and the places we go to when we die so much
better than I do.â€

At the close of the exercises, after the last sermon had been preached
and the last speech of the Indian chief and headmen had been made, a
number of the sub-chiefs were talking informally together. Mr. Young,
anxious to know what impression he had made on the tribe with reference
to mission work, requested John to listen and tell him what was being
said.

â€œThey are talking about Mr. Muirâ€™s speech,â€ he reported. â€œThey say he
knows how to talk and beats the preacher far.â€ Toyatte also, with a
teasing smile, said: â€œMr. Young, mika tillicum hi yu tola wawaâ€ (your
friend leads you far in speaking).

Later, when the sending of a missionary and teacher was being
considered, the chief said they wanted me, and, as an inducement,
promised that if I would come to them they would always do as I
directed, follow my councils, give me as many wives as I liked, build a
church and school, and pick all the stones out of the paths and make
them smooth for my feet.

They were about to set out on an expedition to the Hootsenoos to
collect blankets as indemnity or blood-money for the death of a Chilcat
woman from drinking whiskey furnished by one of the Hootsenoo tribe. In
case of their refusal to pay, there would be fighting, and one of the
chiefs begged that we would pray them good luck, so that no one would
be killed. This he asked as a favor, after begging that we would grant
permission to go on this expedition, promising that they would avoid
bloodshed if possible. He spoke in a very natural and easy tone and
manner always serene and so much of a polished diplomat that all polish
was hidden. The younger chief stood while speaking, the elder sat on
the floor. None of the congregation had a word to say, though they gave
approving nods and shrugs.

The house was packed at every meeting, two a day. Some climbed on the
roof to listen around the smoke opening. I tried in vain to avoid
speechmaking, but, as usual, I had to say something at every meeting. I
made five speeches here, all of which seemed to be gladly heard,
particularly what I said on the different kinds of white men and their
motives, and their own kindness and good manners in making strangers
feel at home in their houses.

The chief had a slave, a young and good-looking girl, who waited on
him, cooked his food, lighted his pipe for him, etc. Her servitude
seemed by no means galling. In the morning, just before we left on the
return trip, interpreter John overheard him telling her that after the
teacher came from Wrangell, he was going to dress her well and send her
to school and use her in every way as if she were his own daughter.
Slaves are still owned by the richest of the Thlinkits. Formerly, many
of them were sacrificed on great occasions, such as the opening of a
new house or the erection of a totem pole. Kadachan ordered John to
take a pair of white blankets out of his trunk and wrap them about the
chiefâ€™s shoulders, as he sat by the fire. This gift was presented
without ceremony or saying a single word. The chief scarcely noticed
the blankets, only taking a corner in his hand, as if testing the
quality of the wool. Toyatte had been an inveterate enemy and fighter
of the Chilcats, but now, having joined the church, he wished to forget
the past and bury all the hard feuds and be universally friendly and
peaceful. It was evident, however, that he mistrusted the proud and
warlike Chilcats and doubted the acceptance of his friendly advances,
and as we approached their village became more and more thoughtful.

â€œMy wife said that my old enemies would be sure to kill me. Well, never
mind. I am an old man and may as well die as not.â€ He was troubled with
palpitation, and oftentimes, while he suffered, he put his hand over
his heart and said, â€œI hope the Chilcats will shoot me here.â€

Before venturing up the river to the principal village, located some
ten miles up the river, we sent Sitka Charley and one of the young
Chilcats as messengers to announce our arrival and inquire whether we
would be welcome to visit them, informing the chief that both Kadachan
and Toyatte were Mr. Youngâ€™s friends and mine, that we were â€œall one
meatâ€ and any harm done them would also be done to us.

While our messengers were away, I climbed a pure-white, dome-crowned
mountain about fifty-five hundred feet high and gained noble telling
views to the northward of the main Chilcat glaciers and the multitude
of mighty peaks from which they draw their sources. At a height of
three thousand feet I found a mountain hemlock, considerably dwarfed,
in company with Sitka spruce and the common hemlock, the tallest about
twenty feet high, sixteen inches in diameter. A few stragglers grew
considerably higher, say at about four thousand feet. Birch and
two-leaf pine were common.

The messengers returned next day, bringing back word that we would all
be heartily welcomed excepting Toyatte; that the guns were loaded and
ready to be fired to welcome us, but that Toyatte, having insulted a
Chilcat chief not long ago in Wrangell, must not come. They also
informed us in their message that they were very busy merrymaking with
other visitors, Sitka Jack and his friends, but that if we could get up
to the village through the running ice on the river, they would all be
glad to see us; they had been drinking and Kadachanâ€™s father, one of
the principal chiefs, said plainly that he had just waked up out of a
ten daysâ€™ sleep. We were anxious to make this visit, but, taking the
difficulties and untoward circumstances into account, the danger of
being frozen in at so late a time, while Kadachan would not be able to
walk back on account of a shot in his foot, the danger also from
whiskey, the awakening of old feuds on account of Toyatteâ€™s presence,
etc., we reluctantly concluded to start back on the home journey at
once. This was on Friday and a fair wind was blowing, but our crew, who
loved dearly to rest and eat in these big hospitable houses, all said
that Monday would be _hyas klosh_ for the starting-day. I insisted,
however, on starting Saturday morning, and succeeded in getting away
from our friends at ten oâ€™clock. Just as we were leaving, the chief who
had entertained us so handsomely requested a written document to show
that he had not killed us, so in case we were lost on the way home he
could not be held accountable in any way for our death.




Chapter XII
The Return to Fort Wrangell


The day of our start for Wrangell was bright and the Hoon, the north
wind, strong. We passed around the east side of the larger island which
lies near the south extremity of the point of land between the Chilcat
and the Chilcoot channels and thence held a direct course down the east
shore of the canal. At sunset we encamped in a small bay at the head of
a beautiful harbor three or four miles south of Bernerâ€™s Bay, and the
next day, being Sunday, we remained in camp as usual, though the wind
was fair and it is not a sin to go home. The Indians spent most of the
day in washing, mending, eating, and singing hymns with Mr. Young, who
also gave them a Bible lesson, while I wrote notes and sketched.
Charley made a sweathouse and all the crew got good baths. This is one
of the most delightful little bays we have thus far enjoyed, girdled
with tall trees whose branches almost meet, and with views of
pure-white mountains across the broad, river-like canal.

Seeing smoke back in the dense woods, we went ashore to seek it and
discovered a Hootsenoo whiskey-factory in full blast. The Indians said
that an old man, a friend of theirs, was about to die and they were
making whiskey for his funeral.

Our Indians were already out of oily flesh, which they regard as a
necessity and consume in enormous quantities. The bacon was nearly gone
and they eagerly inquired for flesh at every camp we passed. Here we
found skinned carcasses of porcupines and a heap of wild mutton lying
on the confused hut floor. Our cook boiled the porcupines in a big pot
with a lot of potatoes we obtained at the same hut, and although the
potatoes were protected by their skins, the awfully wild penetrating
porcupine flavor found a way through the skins and flavored them to the
very heart. Bread and beans and dried fruit we had in abundance, and
none of these rank aboriginal dainties ever came nigh any meal of mine.
The Indians eat the hips of wild roses entire like berries, and I was
laughed at for eating only the outside of this fruit and rejecting the
seeds.

When we were approaching the village of the Auk tribe, venerable
Toyatte seemed to be unusually pensive, as if weighed down by some
melancholy thought. This was so unusual that I waited attentively to
find out the cause of his trouble.

When at last he broke silence it was to say, â€œMr. Young, Mr. Young,â€â€”he
usually repeated the name,â€”â€œI hope you will not stop at the Auk
village.â€

â€œWhy, Toyatte?â€ asked Mr. Young.

â€œBecause they are a bad lot, and preaching to them can do no good.â€

â€œToyatte,â€ said Mr. Young, â€œhave you forgotten what Christ said to his
disciples when he charged them to go forth and preach the gospel to
everybody; and that we should love our enemies and do good to those who
use us badly?â€

â€œWell,â€ replied Toyatte, â€œif you preach to them, you must not call on
me to pray, because I cannot pray for Auks.â€

â€œBut the Bible says we should pray for all men, however bad they may
be.â€

â€œOh, yes, I know that, Mr. Young; I know it very well. But Auks are not
men, good or bad,â€”they are dogs.â€

It was now nearly dark and quite so ere we found a harbor, not far from
the fine Auk Glacier which descends into the narrow channel that
separates Douglas Island from the mainland. Two of the Auks followed us
to our camp after eight oâ€™clock and inquired into our object in
visiting them, that they might carry the news to their chief. One of
the chiefâ€™s houses is opposite our camp a mile or two distant, and we
concluded to call on him next morning.

I wanted to examine the Auk Glacier in the morning, but tried to be
satisfied with a general view and sketch as we sailed around its wide
fan-shaped front. It is one of the most beautiful of all the coast
glaciers that are in the first stage of decadence. We called on the Auk
chief at daylight, when he was yet in bed, but he arose goodnaturedly,
put on a calico shirt, drew a blanket around his legs, and comfortably
seated himself beside a small fire that gave light enough to show his
features and those of his children and the three women that one by one
came out of the shadows. All listened attentively to Mr. Youngâ€™s
message of goodwill. The chief was a serious, sharp-featured,
dark-complexioned man, sensible-looking and with good manners. He was
very sorry, he said, that his people had been drinking in his absence
and had used us so ill; he would like to hear us talk and would call
his people together if we would return to the village. This offer we
had to decline. We gave him good words and tobacco and bade him
good-bye.

The scenery all through the channel is magnificent, something like
Yosemite Valley in its lofty avalanche-swept wall cliffs, especially on
the mainland side, which are so steep few trees can find footing. The
lower island side walls are mostly forested. The trees are heavily
draped with lichens, giving the woods a remarkably gray, ancient look.
I noticed a good many two-leafed pines in boggy spots. The water was
smooth, and the reflections of the lofty walls striped with cascades
were charmingly distinct.

It was not easy to keep my crew full of wild flesh. We called at an
Indian summer camp on the mainland about noon, where there were three
very squalid huts crowded and jammed full of flesh of many colors and
smells, among which we discovered a lot of bright fresh trout, lovely
creatures about fifteen inches long, their sides adorned with vivid red
spots. We purchased five of them and a couple of salmon for a box of
gun-caps and a little tobacco. About the middle of the afternoon we
passed through a fleet of icebergs, their number increasing as we
neared the mouth of the Taku Fiord, where we camped, hoping to explore
the fiord and see the glaciers where the bergs, the first we had seen
since leaving Icy Bay, are derived.

[Illustration: Stranded Icebergs, Taku Glacier.]

We left camp at six oâ€™clock, nearly an hour before daybreak. My Indians
were glad to find the fiord barred by a violent wind, against which we
failed to make any headway; and as it was too late in the season to
wait for better weather, I reluctantly gave up this promising work for
another year, and directed the crew to go straight ahead down the
coast. We sailed across the mouth of the happy inlet at fine speed,
keeping a man at the bow to look out for the smallest of the bergs, not
easily seen in the dim light, and another bailing the canoe as the tops
of some of the white caps broke over us. About two oâ€™clock we passed a
large bay or fiord, out of which a violent wind was blowing, though the
main Stephens Passage was calm. About dusk, when we were all tired and
anxious to get into camp, we reached the mouth of Sum Dum Bay, but
nothing like a safe landing could we find. Our experienced captain was
indignant, as well he might be, because we did not see fit to stop
early in the afternoon at a good camp-ground he had chosen. He seemed
determined to give us enough of night sailing as a punishment to last
us for the rest of the voyage. Accordingly, though the night was dark
and rainy and the bay full of icebergs, he pushed grimly on, saying
that we must try to reach an Indian village on the other side of the
bay or an old Indian fort on an island in the middle of it. We made
slow, weary, anxious progress while Toyatte, who was well acquainted
with every feature of this part of the coast and could find his way in
the dark, only laughed at our misery. After a mile or two of this
dismal night work we struck across toward the island, now invisible,
and came near being wrecked on a rock which showed a smooth round back
over which the waves were breaking. In the hurried Indian shouts that
followed and while we were close against the rock, Mr. Young shouted,
as he leaned over against me, â€œItâ€™s a whale, a whale!â€ evidently
fearing its tail, several specimens of these animals, which were
probably still on his mind, having been seen in the forenoon. While we
were passing along the east shore of the island we saw a light on the
opposite shore, a joyful sight, which Toyatte took for a fire in the
Indian village, and steered for it. John stood in the bow, as guide
through the bergs. Suddenly, we ran aground on a sand bar. Clearing
this, and running back half a mile or so, we again stood for the light,
which now shone brightly. I thought it strange that Indians should have
so large a fire. A broad white mass dimly visible back of the fire Mr.
Young took for the glow of the fire on the clouds. This proved to be
the front of a glacier. After we had effected a landing and stumbled up
toward the fire over a ledge of slippery, algÃ¦-covered rocks, and
through the ordinary tangle of shore grass, we were astonished to find
white men instead of Indians, the first we had seen for a month. They
proved to be a party of seven gold-seekers from Fort Wrangell. It was
now about eight oâ€™clock and they were in bed, but a jolly Irishman got
up to make coffee for us and find out who we were, where we had come
from, where going, and the objects of our travels. We unrolled our
chart and asked for information as to the extent and features of the
bay. But our benevolent friend took great pains to pull wool over our
eyes, and made haste to say that if â€œice and sceneriesâ€ were what we
were looking for, this was a very poor, dull place. There were â€œbig
rocks, gulches, and sceneriesâ€ of a far better quality down the coast
on the way to Wrangell. He and his party were prospecting, he said, but
thus far they had found only a few colors and they proposed going over
to Admiralty Island in the morning to try their luck.

In the morning, however, when the prospectors were to have gone over to
the island, we noticed a smoke half a mile back on a large stream, the
outlet of the glacier we had seen the night before, and an Indian told
us that the white men were building a big log house up there. It
appeared that they had found a promising placer mine in the moraine and
feared we might find it and spread the news. Daylight revealed a
magnificent fiord that brought Glacier Bay to mind. Miles of bergs lay
stranded on the shores, and the waters of the branch fiords, not on
Vancouverâ€™s chart, were crowded with them as far as the eye could
reach. After breakfast we set out to explore an arm of the bay that
trends southeastward, and managed to force a way through the bergs
about ten miles. Farther we could not go. The pack was so close no open
water was in sight, and, convinced at last that this part of my work
would have to be left for another year, we struggled across to the west
side of the fiord and camped.

I climbed a mountain next morning, hoping to gain a view of the great
fruitful glaciers at the head of the fiord or, at least, of their snowy
fountains. But in this also I failed; for at a distance of about
sixteen miles from the mouth of the fiord a change to the northward in
its general trend cut off all its upper course from sight.

Returning to camp baffled and weary, I ordered all hands to pack up and
get out of the ice as soon as possible. And how gladly was that order
obeyed! Toyatteâ€™s grand countenance glowed like a sun-filled glacier,
as he joyfully and teasingly remarked that â€œthe big Sum Dum
ice-mountain had hidden his face from me and refused to let me pay him
a visit.â€ All the crew worked hard boring a way down the west side of
the fiord, and early in the afternoon we reached comparatively open
water near the mouth of the bay. Resting a few minutes among the
drifting bergs, taking last lingering looks at the wonderful place I
might never see again, and feeling sad over my weary failure to explore
it, I was cheered by a friend I little expected to meet here. Suddenly,
I heard the familiar whir of an ouselâ€™s wings, and, looking up, saw my
little comforter coming straight from the shore. In a second or two he
was with me, and flew three times around my head with a happy salute,
as if saying, â€œCheer up, old friend, you see I am here and allâ€™s well.â€
He then flew back to the shore, alighted on the topmost jag of a
stranded iceberg, and began to nod and bow as though he were on one of
his favorite rocks in the middle of a sunny California mountain
cataract.

Mr. Young regretted not meeting the Indians here, but mission work also
had to be left until next season. Our happy crew hoisted sail to a fair
wind, shouted â€œGood-bye, Sum Dum!â€ and soon after dark reached a harbor
a few miles north of Hobart Point.

We made an early start the next day, a fine, calm morning, glided
smoothly down the coast, admiring the magnificent mountains arrayed in
their winter robes, and early in the afternoon reached a lovely harbor
on an island five or six miles north of Cape Fanshawe. Toyatte
predicted a heavy winter storm, though only a mild rain was falling as
yet. Everybody was tired and hungry, and as the voyage was nearing the
end, I consented to stop here. While the shelter tents were being set
up and our blankets stowed under cover, John went out to hunt and
killed a deer within two hundred yards of the camp. When we were at the
camp-fire in Sum Dum Bay, one of the prospectors, replying to Mr.
Youngâ€™s complaint that they were oftentimes out of meat, asked Toyatte
why he and his men did not shoot plenty of ducks for the minister.
â€œBecause the duckâ€™s friend would not let us,â€ said Toyatte; â€œwhen we
want to shoot, Mr. Muir always shakes the canoe.â€

Just as we were passing the south headland of Port Houghton Bay, we
heard a shout, and a few minutes later saw four Indians in a canoe
paddling rapidly after us. In about an hour they overtook us. They were
an Indian, his son, and two women with a load of fish-oil and dried
salmon to sell and trade at Fort Wrangell. They camped within a dozen
yards of us; with their sheets of cedar bark and poles they speedily
made a hut, spread spruce boughs in it for a carpet, unloaded the
canoe, and stored their goods under cover. Toward evening the old man
came smiling with a gift for Toyatte,â€”a large fresh salmon, which was
promptly boiled and eaten by our captain and crew as if it were only a
light refreshment like a biscuit between meals. A few minutes after the
big salmon had vanished, our generous neighbor came to Toyatte with a
second gift of dried salmon, which after being toasted a few minutes
tranquilly followed the fresh one as though it were a mere mouthful.
Then, from the same generous hands, came a third gift,â€”a large
milk-panful of huckleberries and grease boiled together,â€”and, strange
to say, this wonderful mess went smoothly down to rest on the broad and
deep salmon foundation. Thus refreshed, and appetite sharpened, my
sturdy crew made haste to begin on the buck, beans, bread, etc., and,
boiling and roasting, managed to get comfortably full on but little
more than half of it by sundown, making a good deal of sport of my pity
for the deer and refusing to eat any of it and nicknaming me the ice
_ancou_ and the deer and duckâ€™s _tillicum_.

Sunday was a wild, driving, windy day with but little rain but big
promise of more. I took a walk back in the woods. The timber here is
very fine, about as large as any I have seen in Alaska, much better
than farther north. The Sitka spruce and the common hemlock, one
hundred and fifty and two hundred feet high, are slender and handsome.
The Sitka spruce makes good firewood even when green, the hemlock very
poor. Back a little way from the sea, there was a good deal of yellow
cedar, the best I had yet seen. The largest specimen that I saw and
measured on the trip was five feet three inches in diameter and about
one hundred and forty feet high. In the evening Mr. Young gave the
Indians a lesson, calling in our Indian neighbors. He told them the
story of Christ coming to save the world. The Indians wanted to know
why the Jews had killed him. The lesson was listened to with very
marked attention. Toyatteâ€™s generous friend caught a devil-fish about
three feet in diameter to add to his stores of food. It would be very
good, he said, when boiled in berry and colicon-oil soup. Each arm of
this savage animal with its double row of button-like suction discs
closed upon any object brought within reach with a grip nothing could
escape. The Indians tell me that devil-fish live mostly on crabs,
mussels, and clams, the shells of which they easily crunch with their
strong, parrot-like beaks. That was a wild, stormy, rainy night. How
the rain soaked us in our tents!

â€œJust feel that,â€ said the minister in the night, as he took my hand
and plunged it into a pool about three inches deep in which he was
lying.

â€œNever mind,â€ I said, â€œit is only water. Everything is wet now. It will
soon be morning and we will dry at the fire.â€

Our Indian neighbors were, if possible, still wetter. Their hut had
been blown down several times during the night. Our tent leaked badly,
and we were lying in a mossy bog, but around the big camp-fire we were
soon warm and half dry. We had expected to reach Wrangell by this time.
Toyatte said the storm might last several days longer. We were out of
tea and coffee, much to Mr. Youngâ€™s distress. On my return from a walk
I brought in a good big bunch of glandular ledum and boiled it in the
teapot. The result of this experiment was a bright, clear
amber-colored, rank-smelling liquor which I did not taste, but my
suffering companion drank the whole potful and praised it. The rain was
so heavy we decided not to attempt to leave camp until the storm
somewhat abated, as we were assured by Toyatte that we would not be
able to round Cape Fanshawe, a sheer, outjutting headland, the nose as
he called it, past which the wind sweeps with great violence in these
southeastern storms. With what grateful enthusiasm the trees welcomed
the life-giving rain! Strong, towering spruces, hemlocks, and cedars
tossed their arms, bowing, waving, in every leap, quivering and
rejoicing together in the gray, roaring storm. John and Charley put on
their gun-coats and went hunting for another deer, but returned later
in the afternoon with clean hands, having fortunately failed to shed
any more blood. The wind still held in the south, and Toyatte, grimly
trying to comfort us, told us that we might be held here a week or
more, which we should not have minded much, for we had abundance of
provisions. Mr. Young and I shifted our tent and tried to dry blankets.
The wind moderated considerably, and at 7 A.M. we started but met a
rough sea and so stiff a wind we barely succeeded in rounding the cape
by all hands pulling their best. Thence we struggled down the coast,
creeping close to the shore and taking advantage of the shelter of
protecting rocks, making slow, hard-won progress until about the middle
of the afternoon, when the sky opened and the blessed sun shone out
over the beautiful waters and forests with rich amber light; and the
high, glacier-laden mountains, adorned with fresh snow, slowly came to
view in all their grandeur, the bluish-gray clouds crawling and
lingering and dissolving until every vestige of them vanished. The
sunlight made the upper snow-fields pale creamy yellow, like that seen
on the Chilcat mountains the first day of our return trip. Shortly
after the sky cleared, the wind abated and changed around to the north,
so that we ventured to hoist our sail, and then the weary Indians had
rest. It was interesting to note how speedily the heavy swell that had
been rolling for the last two or three days was subdued by the
comparatively light breeze from the opposite direction. In a few
minutes the sound was smooth and no trace of the storm was left, save
the fresh snow and the discoloration of the water. All the water of the
sound as far as I noticed was pale coffee-color like that of the
streams in boggy woods. How much of this color was due to the inflow of
the flooded streams many times increased in size and number by the
rain, and how much to the beating of the waves along the shore stirring
up vegetable matter in shallow bays, I cannot determine. The effect,
however, was very marked.

About four oâ€™clock we saw smoke on the shore and ran in for news. We
found a company of Taku Indians, who were on their way to Fort
Wrangell, some six men and about the same number of women. The men were
sitting in a bark hut, handsomely reinforced and embowered with fresh
spruce boughs. The women were out at the side of a stream, washing
their many bits of calico. A little girl, six or seven years old, was
sitting on the gravelly beach, building a playhouse of white quartz
pebbles, scarcely caring to stop her work to gaze at us. Toyatte found
a friend among the men, and wished to encamp beside them for the night,
assuring us that this was the only safe harbor to be found within a
good many miles. But we resolved to push on a little farther and make
use of the smooth weather after being stormbound so long, much to
Toyatte and his companionâ€™s disgust. We rowed about a couple of miles
and ran into a cozy cove where wood and water were close at hand. How
beautiful and homelike it was! plushy moss for mattresses decked with
red corner berries, noble spruce standing guard about us and spreading
kindly protecting arms. A few ferns, aspidiums, polypodiums, with
dewberry vines, coptis, pyrola, leafless huckleberry bushes, and ledum
grow beneath the trees. We retired at eight oâ€™clock, and just then
Toyatte, who had been attentively studying the sky, presaged rain and
another southeaster for the morrow.

The sky was a little cloudy next morning, but the air was still and the
water smooth. We all hoped that Toyatte, the old weather prophet, had
misread the sky signs. But before reaching Point Vanderpeut the rain
began to fall and the dreaded southeast wind to blow, which soon
increased to a stiff breeze, next thing to a gale, that lashed the
sound into ragged white caps. Cape Vanderpeut is part of the terminal
of an ancient glacier that once extended six or eight miles out from
the base of the mountains. Three large glaciers that once were
tributaries still descend nearly to the sea-level, though their fronts
are back in narrow fiords, eight or ten miles from the sound. A similar
point juts out into the sound five or six miles to the south, while the
missing portion is submerged and forms a shoal.

All the cape is forested save a narrow strip about a mile long,
composed of large boulders against which the waves beat with loud
roaring. A bar of foam a mile or so farther out showed where the waves
were breaking on a submerged part of the moraine, and I supposed that
we would be compelled to pass around it in deep water, but Toyatte,
usually so cautious, determined to cross it, and after giving
particular directions, with an encouraging shout every oar and paddle
was strained to shoot through a narrow gap. Just at the most critical
point a big wave heaved us aloft and dropped us between two huge
rounded boulders, where, had the canoe been a foot or two closer to
either of them, it must have been smashed. Though I had offered no
objection to our experienced pilotâ€™s plan, it looked dangerous, and I
took the precaution to untie my shoes so they could be quickly shaken
off for swimming. But after crossing the bar we were not yet out of
danger, for we had to struggle hard to keep from being driven ashore
while the waves were beating us broadside on. At length we discovered a
little inlet, into which we gladly escaped. A pure-white iceberg,
weathered to the form of a cross, stood amid drifts of kelp and the
black rocks of the wave-beaten shore in sign of safety and welcome. A
good fire soon warmed and dried us into common comfort. Our narrow
escape was the burden of conversation as we sat around the fire.
Captain Toyatte told us of two similar adventures while he was a strong
young man. In both of them his canoe was smashed and he swam ashore out
of the surge with a gun in his teeth. He says that if we had struck the
rocks he and Mr. Young would have been drowned, all the rest of us
probably would have been saved. Then, turning to me, he asked me if I
could have made a fire in such a case without matches, and found a way
to Wrangell without canoe or food.

We started about daybreak from our blessed white cross harbor, and,
after rounding a bluff cape opposite the mouth of Wrangell Narrows, a
fleet of icebergs came in sight, and of course I was eager to trace
them to their source. Toyatte naturally enough was greatly excited
about the safety of his canoe and begged that we should not venture to
force a way through the bergs, risking the loss of the canoe and our
lives now that we were so near the end of our long voyage.

â€œOh, never fear, Toyatte,â€ I replied. â€œYou know we are always luckyâ€”the
weather is good. I only want to see the Thunder Glacier for a few
minutes, and should the bergs be packed dangerously close, I promise to
turn back and wait until next summer.â€

Thus assured, he pushed rapidly on until we entered the fiord, where we
had to go cautiously slow. The bergs were close packed almost
throughout the whole extent of the fiord, but we managed to reach a
point about two miles from the headâ€”commanding a good view of the
down-plunging lower end of the glacier and blue, jagged ice-wall. This
was one of the most imposing of the first-class glaciers I had as yet
seen, and with its magnificent fiord formed a fine triumphant close for
our seasonâ€™s ice work. I made a few notes and sketches and turned back
in time to escape from the thickest packs of bergs before dark. Then
Kadachan was stationed in the bow to guide through the open portion of
the mouth of the fiord and across Soutchoi Strait. It was not until
several hours after dark that we were finally free from ice. We
occasionally encountered stranded packs on the delta, which in the
starlight seemed to extend indefinitely in every direction. Our danger
lay in breaking the canoe on small bergs hard to see and in getting too
near the larger ones that might split or roll over.

â€œOh, when will we escape from this ice?â€ moaned much-enduring old
Toyatte.

We ran aground in several places in crossing the Stickeen delta, but
finally succeeded in groping our way over muddy shallows before the
tide fell, and encamped on the boggy shore of a small island, where we
discovered a spot dry enough to sleep on, after tumbling about in a
tangle of bushes and mossy logs.

We left our last camp November 21 at daybreak. The weather was calm and
bright. Wrangell Island came into view beneath a lovely rosy sky, all
the forest down to the waterâ€™s edge silvery gray with a dusting of
snow. John and Charley seemed to be seriously distressed to find
themselves at the end of their journey while a portion of the stock of
provisions remained uneaten. â€œWhat is to be done about it?â€ they asked,
more than half in earnest. The fine, strong, and specious deliberation
of Indians was well illustrated on this eventful trip. It was fresh
every morning. They all behaved well, however, exerted themselves under
tedious hardships without flinching for days or weeks at a time; never
seemed in the least nonplussed; were prompt to act in every exigency;
good as servants, fellow travelers, and even friends.

We landed on an island in sight of Wrangell and built a big smoky
signal fire for friends in town, then set sail, unfurled our flag, and
about noon completed our long journey of seven or eight hundred miles.
As we approached the town, a large canoeful of friendly Indians came
flying out to meet us, cheering and handshaking in lusty Boston
fashion. The friends of Mr. Young had intended to come out in a body to
welcome him back, but had not had time to complete their arrangements
before we landed. Mr. Young was eager for news. I told him there could
be no news of importance about a town. We only had real news, drawn
from the wilderness. The mail steamer had left Wrangell eight days
before, and Mr. Vanderbilt and family had sailed on her to Portland. I
had to wait a month for the next steamer, and though I would have liked
to go again to Nature, the mountains were locked for the winter and
canoe excursions no longer safe.

So I shut myself up in a good garret alone to wait and work. I was
invited to live with Mr. Young but concluded to prepare my own food and
enjoy quiet work. How grandly long the nights were and short the days!
At noon the sun seemed to be about an hour high, the clouds colored
like sunset. The weather was rather stormy. North winds prevailed for a
week at a time, sending down the temperature to near zero and chilling
the vapor of the bay into white reek, presenting a curious appearance
as it streamed forward on the wind, like combed wool. At Sitka the
minimum was eight degrees plus; at Wrangell, near the storm-throat of
the Stickeen, zero. This is said to be the coldest weather ever
experienced in southeastern Alaska.




Chapter XIII
Alaska Indians


Looking back on my Alaska travels, I have always been glad that good
luck gave me Mr. Young as a companion, for he brought me into confiding
contact with the Thlinkit tribes, so that I learned their customs, what
manner of men they were, how they lived and loved, fought and played,
their morals, religion, hopes and fears, and superstitions, how they
resembled and differed in their characteristics from our own and other
races. It was easy to see that they differed greatly from the typical
American Indian of the interior of this continent. They were doubtless
derived from the Mongol stock. Their down-slanting oval eyes, wide
cheek-bones, and rather thick, outstanding upper lips at once suggest
their connection with the Chinese or Japanese. I have not seen a single
specimen that looks in the least like the best of the Sioux, or indeed
of any of the tribes to the east of the Rocky Mountains. They also
differ from other North American Indians in being willing to work, when
free from the contamination of bad whites. They manage to feed
themselves well, build good substantial houses, bravely fight their
enemies, love their wives and children and friends, and cherish a quick
sense of honor. The best of them prefer death to dishonor, and
sympathize with their neighbors in their misfortunes and sorrows. Thus
when a family loses a child by death, neighbors visit them to cheer and
console. They gather around the fire and smoke, talk kindly and
naturally, telling the sorrowing parents not to grieve too much,
reminding them of the better lot of their child in another world and of
the troubles and trials the little ones escape by dying young, all this
in a perfectly natural, straightforward way, wholly unlike the vacant,
silent, hesitating behavior of most civilized friends, who oftentimes
in such cases seem nonplussed, awkward, and afraid to speak, however
sympathetic.

The Thlinkits are fond and indulgent parents. In all my travels I never
heard a cross, fault-finding word, or anything like scolding inflicted
on an Indian child, or ever witnessed a single case of spanking, so
common in civilized communities. They consider the want of a son to
bear their name and keep it alive the saddest and most deplorable
ill-fortune imaginable.

The Thlinkit tribes give a hearty welcome to Christian missionaries. In
particular they are quick to accept the doctrine of the atonement,
because they themselves practice it, although to many of the civilized
whites it is a stumbling-block and rock of offense. As an example of
their own doctrine of atonement they told Mr. Young and me one evening
that twenty or thirty years ago there was a bitter war between their
own and the Sitka tribe, great fighters, and pretty evenly matched.
After fighting all summer in a desultory, squabbling way, fighting now
under cover, now in the open, watching for every chance for a shot,
none of the women dared venture to the salmon-streams or berry-fields
to procure their winter stock of food. At this crisis one of the
Stickeen chiefs came out of his block-house fort into an open space
midway between their fortified camps, and shouted that he wished to
speak to the leader of the Sitkas.

When the Sitka chief appeared he said:â€”

â€œMy people are hungry. They dare not go to the salmon-streams or
berry-fields for winter supplies, and if this war goes on much longer
most of my people will die of hunger. We have fought long enough; let
us make peace. You brave Sitka warriors go home, and we will go home,
and we will all set out to dry salmon and berries before it is too
late.â€

The Sitka chief replied:â€”

â€œYou may well say let us stop fighting, when you have had the best of
it. You have killed ten more of my tribe than we have killed of yours.
Give us ten Stickeen men to balance our blood-account; then, and not
till then, will we make peace and go home.â€

â€œVery well,â€ replied the Stickeen chief, â€œyou know my rank. You know
that I am worth ten common men and more. Take me and make peace.â€

This noble offer was promptly accepted; the Stickeen chief stepped
forward and was shot down in sight of the fighting bands. Peace was
thus established, and all made haste to their homes and ordinary work.
That chief literally gave himself a sacrifice for his people. He died
that they might live. Therefore, when missionaries preached the
doctrine of atonement, explaining that when all mankind had gone
astray, had broken Godâ€™s laws and deserved to die, Godâ€™s son came
forward, and, like the Stickeen chief, offered himself as a sacrifice
to heal the cause of Godâ€™s wrath and set all the people of the world
free, the doctrine was readily accepted.

â€œYes, your words are good,â€ they said. â€œThe Son of God, the Chief of
chiefs, the Maker of all the world, must be worth more than all mankind
put together; therefore, when His blood was shed, the salvation of the
world was made sure.â€

A telling illustration of the ready acceptance of this doctrine was
displayed by Shakes, head chief of the Stickeens at Fort Wrangell. A
few years before my first visit to the Territory, when the first
missionary arrived, he requested Shakes to call his people together to
hear the good word he had brought them. Shakes accordingly sent out
messengers throughout the village, telling his people to wash their
faces, put on their best clothing, and come to his block-house to hear
what their visitor had to say. When all were assembled, the missionary
preached a Christian sermon on the fall of man and the atonement
whereby Christ, the Son of God, the Chief of chiefs, had redeemed all
mankind, provided that this redemption was voluntarily accepted with
repentance of their sins and the keeping of his commandments.

When the missionary had finished his sermon, Chief Shakes slowly arose,
and, after thanking the missionary for coming so far to bring them good
tidings and taking so much unselfish interest in the welfare of his
tribe, he advised his people to accept the new religion, for he felt
satisfied that because the white man knew so much more than the Indian,
the white manâ€™s religion was likely to be better than theirs.

â€œThe white man,â€ said he, â€œmakes great ships. We, like children, can
only make canoes. He makes his big ships go with the wind, and he also
makes them go with fire. We chop down trees with stone axes; the Boston
man with iron axes, which are far better. In everything the ways of the
white man seem to be better than ours. Compared with the white man we
are only blind children, knowing not how best to live either here or in
the country we go to after we die. So I wish you to learn this new
religion and teach it to your children, that you may all go when you
die into that good heaven country of the white man and be happy. But I
am too old to learn a new religion, and besides, many of my people who
have died were bad and foolish people, and if this word the missionary
has brought us is true, and I think it is, many of my people must be in
that bad country the missionary calls â€˜Hell,â€™ and I must go there also,
for a Stickeen chief never deserts his people in time of trouble. To
that bad country, therefore, I will go, and try to cheer my people and
help them as best I can to endure their misery.â€

Toyatte was a famous orator. I was present at the meeting at Fort
Wrangell at which he was examined and admitted as a member of the
Presbyterian Church. When called upon to answer the questions as to his
ideas of God, and the principal doctrines of Christianity, he slowly
arose in the crowded audience, while the missionary said, â€œToyatte, you
do not need to rise. You can answer the questions seated.â€

To this he paid no attention, but stood several minutes without
speaking a word, never for a moment thinking of sitting down like a
tired woman while making the most important of all the speeches of his
life. He then explained in detail what his mother had taught him as to
the character of God, the great Maker of the world; also what the
shamans had taught him; the thoughts that often came to his mind when
he was alone on hunting expeditions, and what he first thought of the
religion which the missionaries had brought them. In all his gestures,
and in the language in which he expressed himself, there was a noble
simplicity and earnestness and majestic bearing which made the sermons
and behavior of the three distinguished divinity doctors present seem
commonplace in comparison.

Soon after our return to Fort Wrangell this grand old man was killed in
a quarrel in which he had taken no other part than that of peacemaker.
A number of the Taku tribe came to Fort Wrangell, camped near the
Stickeen village, and made merry, manufacturing and drinking
_hootchenoo_, a vile liquor distilled from a mash made of flour, dried
apples, sugar, and molasses, and drunk hot from the still. The
manufacture of _hootchenoo_ being illegal, and several of Toyatteâ€™s
tribe having been appointed deputy constables to prevent it, they went
to the Taku camp and destroyed as much of the liquor as they could
find. The Takus resisted, and during the quarrel one of the Stickeens
struck a Taku in the faceâ€”an unpardonable offense. The next day
messengers from the Taku camp gave notice to the Stickeens that they
must make atonement for that blow, or fight with guns. Mr. Young, of
course, was eager to stop the quarrel and so was Toyatte. They advised
the Stickeen who had struck the Taku to return to their camp and submit
to an equal blow in the face from the Taku. He did so; went to the
camp, said he was ready to make atonement, and invited the person whom
he had struck to strike him. This the Taku did with so much force that
the balance of justice was again disturbed. The attention of the Takus
was called to the fact that this atoning blow was far harder than the
one to be atoned for, and immediately a sort of general free fist-fight
began, and the quarrel was thus increased in bitterness rather than
diminished.

Next day the Takus sent word to the Stickeens to get their guns ready,
for to-morrow they would come up and fight them, thus boldly declaring
war. The Stickeens in great excitement assembled and loaded their guns
for the coming strife. Mr. Young ran hither and thither amongst the men
of his congregation, forbidding them to fight, reminding them that
Christ told them when they were struck to offer the other cheek instead
of giving a blow in return, doing everything in his power to still the
storm, but all in vain. Toyatte stood outside one of the big
blockhouses with his men about him, awaiting the onset of the Takus.
Mr. Young tried hard to get him away to a place of safety, reminding
him that he belonged to his church and no longer had any right to
fight. Toyatte calmly replied:â€”

â€œMr. Young, Mr. Young, I am not going to fight. You see I have no gun
in my hand; but I cannot go inside of the fort to a place of safety
like women and children while my young men are exposed to the bullets
of their enemies. I must stay with them and share their dangers, but I
will not fight. But you, Mr. Young, _you_ must go away; you are a
minister and you are an important man. It would not do for you to be
exposed to bullets. Go to your home in the fort; pretty soon â€˜hi yu
pooghâ€™â€ (much shooting).

At the first fire Toyatte fell, shot through the breast. Thus died for
his people the noblest old Roman of them all.

On this first Alaska excursion I saw Toyatte under all
circumstances,â€”in rain and snow, landing at night in dark storms,
making fires, building shelters, exposed to all kinds of discomfort,
but never under any circumstances did I ever see him do anything, or
make a single gesture, that was not dignified, or hear him say a word
that might not be uttered anywhere. He often deplored the fact that he
had no son to take his name at his death, and expressed himself as very
grateful when I told him that his name would not be forgotten,â€”that I
had named one of the Stickeen glaciers for him.




Part II
_The Trip of 1880_




Chapter XIV
Sum Dum Bay


I arrived early on the morning of the eighth of August on the steamer
California to continue my explorations of the fiords to the northward
which were closed by winter the previous November. The noise of our
cannon and whistle was barely sufficient to awaken the sleepy town. The
morning shout of one good rooster was the only evidence of life and
health in all the place. Everything seemed kindly and familiarâ€”the
glassy water; evergreen islands; the Indians with their canoes and
baskets and blankets and berries; the jet ravens, prying and flying
about the streets and spruce trees; and the bland, hushed atmosphere
brooding tenderly over all.

How delightful it is, and how it makes oneâ€™s pulses bound to get back
into this reviving northland wilderness! How truly wild it is, and how
joyously oneâ€™s heart responds to the welcome it gives, its waters and
mountains shining and glowing like enthusiastic human faces! Gliding
along the shores of its network of channels, we may travel thousands of
miles without seeing any mark of man, save at long intervals some
little Indian village or the faint smoke of a camp-fire. Even these are
confined to the shore. Back a few yards from the beach the forests are
as trackless as the sky, while the mountains, wrapped in their snow and
ice and clouds, seem never before to have been even looked at.

For those who really care to get into hearty contact with the coast
region, travel by canoe is by far the better way. The larger canoes
carry from one to three tons, rise lightly over any waves likely to be
met on the inland channels, go well under sail, and are easily paddled
alongshore in calm weather or against moderate winds, while snug
harbors where they may ride at anchor or be pulled up on a smooth beach
are to be found almost everywhere. With plenty of provisions packed in
boxes, and blankets and warm clothing in rubber or canvas bags, you may
be truly independent, and enter into partnership with Nature; to be
carried with the winds and currents, accept the noble invitations
offered all along your way to enter the mountain fiords, the homes of
the waterfalls and glaciers, and encamp almost every night beneath
hospitable trees.

I left Fort Wrangell the 16th of August, accompanied by Mr. Young, in a
canoe about twenty-five feet long and five wide, carrying two small
square sails and manned by two Stickeen Indiansâ€”Captain Tyeen and
Hunter Joeâ€”and a half-breed named Smart Billy. The day was calm, and
bright, fleecy, clouds hung about the lowest of the mountain-brows,
while far above the clouds the peaks were seen stretching grandly away
to the northward with their ice and snow shining in as calm a light as
that which was falling on the glassy waters. Our Indians welcomed the
work that lay before them, dipping their oars in exact time with hearty
good will as we glided past island after island across the delta of the
Stickeen into Soutchoi Channel.

By noon we came in sight of a fleet of icebergs from Hutli Bay. The
Indian name of this icy fiord is Hutli, or Thunder Bay, from the sound
made by the bergs in falling and rising from the front of the inflowing
glacier.

As we floated happily on over the shining waters, the beautiful
islands, in ever-changing pictures, were an unfailing source of
enjoyment; but chiefly our attention was turned upon the mountains.
Bold granite headlands with their feet in the channel, or some
broad-shouldered peak of surpassing grandeur, would fix the eye, or
some one of the larger glaciers, with far-reaching tributaries clasping
entire groups of peaks and its great crystal river pouring down through
the forest between gray ridges and domes. In these grand picture
lessons the day was spent, and we spread our blankets beneath a Menzies
spruce on moss two feet deep.

Next morning we sailed around an outcurving bank of boulders and sand
ten miles long, the terminal moraine of a grand old glacier on which
last November we met a perilous adventure. It is located just opposite
three large converging glaciers which formerly united to form the
vanished trunk of the glacier to which the submerged moraine belonged.
A few centuries ago it must have been the grandest feature of this part
of the coast, and, so well preserved are the monuments of its
greatness, the noble old ice-river may be seen again in imagination
about as vividly as if present in the flesh, with snow-clouds crawling
about its fountains, sunshine sparkling on its broad flood, and its
ten-mile ice-wall planted in the deep waters of the channel and sending
off its bergs with loud resounding thunder.

About noon we rounded Cape Fanshawe, scudding swiftly before a fine
breeze, to the delight of our Indians, who had now only to steer and
chat. Here we overtook two Hoona Indians and their families on their
way home from Fort Wrangell. They had exchanged five sea-otter furs,
worth about a hundred dollars apiece, and a considerable number of
fur-seal, land-otter, marten, beaver, and other furs and skins, some
$800 worth, for a new canoe valued at eighty dollars, some flour,
tobacco, blankets, and a few barrels of molasses for the manufacture of
whiskey. The blankets were not to wear, but to keep as money, for the
almighty dollar of these tribes is a Hudsonâ€™s Bay blanket. The wind
died away soon after we met, and as the two canoes glided slowly side
by side, the Hoonas made minute inquiries as to who we were and what we
were doing so far north. Mr. Youngâ€™s object in meeting the Indians as a
missionary they could in part understand, but mine in searching for
rocks and glaciers seemed past comprehension, and they asked our
Indians whether gold-mines might not be the main object. They
remembered, however, that I had visited their Glacier Bay ice-mountains
a year ago, and seemed to think there might be, after all, some
mysterious interest about them of which they were ignorant. Toward the
middle of the afternoon they engaged our crew in a race. We pushed a
little way ahead for a time, but, though possessing a considerable
advantage, as it would seem, in our long oars, they at length overtook
us and kept up until after dark, when we camped together in the rain on
the bank of a salmon-stream among dripping grass and bushes some
twenty-five miles beyond Cape Fanshawe.

These cold northern waters are at times about as brilliantly
phosphorescent as those of the warm South, and so they were this
evening in the rain and darkness, with the temperature of the water at
forty-nine degrees, the air fifty-one. Every stroke of the oar made a
vivid surge of white light, and the canoes left shining tracks.

As we neared the mouth of the well-known salmon-stream where we
intended making our camp, we noticed jets and flashes of silvery light
caused by the startled movement of the salmon that were on their way to
their spawning-grounds. These became more and more numerous and
exciting, and our Indians shouted joyfully, â€œHi yu salmon! Hi yu
muck-a-muck!â€ while the water about the canoe and beneath the canoe was
churned by thousands of fins into silver fire. After landing two of our
men to commence camp-work, Mr. Young and I went up the stream with
Tyeen to the foot of a rapid, to see him catch a few salmon for supper.
The stream ways so filled with them there seemed to be more fish than
water in it, and we appeared to be sailing in boiling, seething silver
light marvelously relieved in the jet darkness. In the midst of the
general auroral glow and the specially vivid flashes made by the
frightened fish darting ahead and to right and left of the canoe, our
attention was suddenly fixed by a long, steady, comet-like blaze that
seemed to be made by some frightful monster that was pursuing us. But
when the portentous object reached the canoe, it proved to be only our
little dog, Stickeen.

After getting the canoe into a side eddy at the foot of the rapids,
Tyeen caught half a dozen salmon in a few minutes by means of a large
hook fastened to the end of a pole. They were so abundant that he
simply groped for them in a random way, or aimed at them by the light
they themselves furnished. That food to last a month or two may thus be
procured in less than an hour is a striking illustration of the
fruitfulness of these Alaskan waters.

[Illustration: Vegetation at High-Tide Line, Sitka Harbor.]

Our Hoona neighbors were asleep in the morning at sunrise, lying in a
row, wet and limp like dead salmon. A little boy about six years old,
with no other covering than a remnant of a shirt, was lying peacefully
on his back, like Tam oâ€™ Shanter, despising wind and rain and fire. He
is up now, looking happy and fresh, with no clothes to dry and no need
of washing while this weather lasts. The two babies are firmly strapped
on boards, leaving only their heads and hands free. Their mothers are
nursing them, holding the boards on end, while they sit on the ground
with their breasts level with the little prisonersâ€™ mouths.

This morning we found out how beautiful a nook we had got into. Besides
the charming picturesqueness of its lines, the colors about it,
brightened by the rain, made a fine study. Viewed from the shore, there
was first a margin of dark-brown algÃ¦, then a bar of yellowish-brown,
next a dark bar on the rugged rocks marking the highest tides, then a
bar of granite boulders with grasses in the seams, and above this a
thick, bossy, overleaning fringe of bushes colored red and yellow and
green. A wall of spruces and hemlocks draped and tufted with gray and
yellow lichens and mosses embowered the campground and overarched the
little river, while the camp-fire smoke, like a stranded cloud, lay
motionless in their branches. Down on the beach ducks and sandpipers in
flocks of hundreds were getting their breakfasts, bald eagles were seen
perched on dead spars along the edge of the woods, heavy-looking and
overfed, gazing stupidly like gorged vultures, and porpoises were
blowing and plunging outside.

As for the salmon, as seen this morning urging their way up the swift
current,â€”tens of thousands of them, side by side, with their backs out
of the water in shallow places now that the tide was low,â€”nothing that
I could write might possibly give anything like a fair conception of
the extravagance of their numbers. There was more salmon apparently,
bulk for bulk, than water in the stream. The struggling multitudes,
crowding one against another, could not get out of our way when we
waded into the midst of them. One of our men amused himself by seizing
them above the tail and swinging them over his head. Thousands could
thus be taken by hand at low tide, while they were making their way
over the shallows among the stones.

Whatever may be said of other resources of the Territory, it is hardly
possible to exaggerate the importance of the fisheries. Not to mention
cod, herring, halibut, etc., there are probably not less than a
thousand salmon-streams in southeastern Alaska as large or larger than
this one (about forty feet wide) crowded with salmon several times a
year. The first run commenced that year in July, while the king salmon,
one of the five species recognized by the Indians, was in the Chilcat
River about the middle of the November before.

From this wonderful salmon-camp we sailed joyfully up the coast to
explore icy Sum Dum Bay, beginning my studies where I left off the
previous November. We started about six oâ€™clock, and pulled merrily on
through fog and rain, the beautiful wooded shore on our right, passing
bergs here and there, the largest of which, though not over two hundred
feet long, seemed many times larger as they loomed gray and indistinct
through the fog. For the first five hours the sailing was open and
easy, nor was there anything very exciting to be seen or heard, save
now and then the thunder of a falling berg rolling and echoing from
cliff to cliff, and the sustained roar of cataracts.

About eleven oâ€™clock we reached a point where the fiord was packed with
ice all the way across, and we ran ashore to fit a block of wood on the
cutwater of our canoe to prevent its being battered or broken. While
Captain Tyeen, who had had considerable experience among berg ice, was
at work on the canoe, Hunter Joe and Smart Billy prepared a warm lunch.

The sheltered hollow where we landed seems to be a favorite
camping-ground for the Sum Dum seal-hunters. The pole-frames of tents,
tied with cedar bark, stood on level spots strewn with seal bones, bits
of salmon, and spruce bark.

We found the work of pushing through the ice rather tiresome. An
opening of twenty or thirty yards would be found here and there, then a
close pack that had to be opened by pushing the smaller bergs aside
with poles. I enjoyed the labor, however, for the fine lessons I got,
and in an hour or two we found zigzag lanes of water, through which we
paddled with but little interruption, and had leisure to study the
wonderful variety of forms the bergs presented as we glided past them.
The largest we saw did not greatly exceed two hundred feet in length,
or twenty-five or thirty feet in height above the water. Such bergs
would draw from one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet of water. All
those that have floated long undisturbed have a projecting base at the
water-line, caused by the more rapid melting of the immersed portion.
When a portion of the berg breaks off, another base line is formed, and
the old one, sharply cut, may be seen rising at all angles, giving it a
marked character. Many of the oldest bergs are beautifully ridged by
the melting out of narrow furrows strictly parallel throughout the
mass, revealing the bedded structure of the ice, acquired perhaps
centuries ago, on the mountain snow fountains. A berg suddenly going to
pieces is a grand sight, especially when the water is calm and no
motion is visible save perchance the slow drift of the tide-current.
The prolonged roar of its fall comes with startling effect, and heavy
swells are raised that haste away in every direction to tell what has
taken place, and tens of thousands of its neighbors rock and swash in
sympathy, repeating the news over and over again. We were too near
several large ones that fell apart as we passed them, and our canoe had
narrow escapes. The seal-hunters, Tyeen says, are frequently lost in
these sudden berg accidents.

In the afternoon, while we were admiring the scenery, which, as we
approached the head of the fiord, became more and more sublime, one of
our Indians called attention to a flock of wild goats on a mountain
overhead, and soon afterwards we saw two other flocks, at a height of
about fifteen hundred feet, relieved against the mountains as white
spots. They are abundant here and throughout the Alaskan Alps in
general, feeding on the grassy slopes above the timber-line. Their
long, yellowish hair is shed at this time of year and they were snowy
white. None of natureâ€™s cattle are better fed or better protected from
the cold. Tyeen told us that before the introduction of guns they used
to hunt them with spears, chasing them with their wolf-dogs, and thus
bringing them to bay among the rocks, where they were easily approached
and killed.

The upper half of the fiord is about from a mile to a mile and a half
wide, and shut in by sublime Yosemite cliffs, nobly sculptured, and
adorned with waterfalls and fringes of trees, bushes, and patches of
flowers; but amid so crowded a display of novel beauty it was not easy
to concentrate the attention long enough on any portion of it without
giving more days and years than our lives could afford. I was
determined to see at least the grand fountain of all this ice. As we
passed headland after headland, hoping as each was rounded we should
obtain a view of it, it still remained hidden.

â€œIce-mountain hi yu kumtux hide,â€â€”glaciers know how to hide extremely
well,â€”said Tyeen, as he rested for a moment after rounding a huge
granite shoulder of the wall whence we expected to gain a view of the
extreme head of the fiord. The bergs, however, were less closely packed
and we made good progress, and at half-past eight oâ€™clock, fourteen and
a half hours after setting out, the great glacier came in sight at the
head of a branch of the fiord that comes in from the northeast.

The discharging front of this fertile, fast-flowing glacier is about
three quarters of a mile wide, and probably eight or nine hundred feet
deep, about one hundred and fifty feet of its depth rising above the
water as a grand blue barrier wall. It is much wider a few miles
farther back, the front being jammed between sheer granite walls from
thirty-five hundred to four thousand feet high. It shows grandly from
where it broke on our sight, sweeping boldly forward and downward in
its majestic channel, swaying from side to side in graceful fluent
lines around stern unflinching rocks. While I stood in the canoe making
a sketch of it, several bergs came off with tremendous dashing and
thunder, raising a cloud of ice-dust and spray to a height of a hundred
feet or more.

â€œThe ice-mountain is well disposed toward you,â€ said Tyeen. â€œHe is
firing his big guns to welcome you.â€

After completing my sketch and entering a few notes, I directed the
crew to pull around a lofty burnished rock on the west side of the
channel, where, as I knew from the trend of the caÃ±on, a large glacier
once came in; and what was my delight to discover that the glacier was
still there and still pouring its ice into a branch of the fiord. Even
the Indians shared my joy and shouted with me. I expected only one
first-class glacier here, and found two. They are only about two miles
apart. How glorious a mansion that precious pair dwell in! After sunset
we made haste to seek a camp-ground. I would fain have shared these
upper chambers with the two glaciers, but there was no landing-place in
sight, and we had to make our way back a few miles in the twilight to
the mouth of a side caÃ±on where we had seen timber on the way up. There
seemed to be a good landing as we approached the shore, but, coming
nearer, we found that the granite fell directly into deep water without
leading any level margin, though the slope a short distance back was
not very steep.

After narrowly scanning the various seams and steps that roughened the
granite, we concluded to attempt a landing rather than grope our way
farther down the fiord through the ice. And what a time we had climbing
on hands and knees up the slippery glacier-polished rocks to a shelf
some two hundred feet above the water and dragging provisions and
blankets after us! But it proved to be a glorious place, the very best
camp-ground of all the trip,â€”a perfect garden, ripe berries nodding
from a fringe of bushes around its edges charmingly displayed in the
light of our big fire. Close alongside there was a lofty mountain
capped with ice, and from the blue edge of that ice-cap there were
sixteen silvery cascades in a row, falling about four thousand feet,
each one of the sixteen large enough to be heard at least two miles.

How beautiful was the firelight on the nearest larkspurs and geraniums
and daisies of our garden! How hearty the wave greeting on the rocks
below brought to us from the two glaciers! And how glorious a song the
sixteen cascades sang!

The cascade songs made us sleep all the sounder, and we were so happy
as to find in the morning that the berg waves had spared our canoe. We
set off in high spirits down the fiord and across to the right side to
explore a remarkably deep and narrow branch of the main fiord that I
had noted on the way up, and that, from the magnitude of the glacial
characters on the two colossal rocks that guard the entrance, promised
a rich reward for our pains.

After we had sailed about three miles up this side fiord, we came to
what seemed to be its head, for trees and rocks swept in a curve around
from one side to the other without showing any opening, although the
walls of the caÃ±on were seen extending back indefinitely, one majestic
brow beyond the other.

When we were tracing this curve, however, in a leisurely way, in search
of a good landing, we were startled by Captain Tyeen shouting, â€œSkookum
chuck! Skookum chuck!â€ (strong water, strong water), and found our
canoe was being swept sideways by a powerful current, the roar of which
we had mistaken for a waterfall. We barely escaped being carried over a
rocky bar on the boiling flood, which, as we afterwards learned, would
have been only a happy shove on our way. After we had made a landing a
little distance back from the brow of the bar, we climbed the highest
rock near the shore to seek a view of the channel beyond the inflowing
tide rapids, to find out whether or no we could safely venture in. Up
over rolling, mossy, bushy, burnished rock waves we scrambled for an
hour or two, which resulted in a fair view of the deep-blue waters of
the fiord stretching on and on along the feet of the most majestic
Yosemite rocks we had yet seen. This determined our plan of shooting
the rapids and exploring it to its farthest recesses. This novel
interruption of the channel is a bar of exceedingly hard resisting
granite, over which the great glacier that once occupied it swept,
without degrading it to the general level, and over which tide-waters
now rush in and out with the violence of a mountain torrent.

Returning to the canoe, we pushed off, and in a few moments were racing
over the bar with lightning speed through hurrahing waves and eddies
and sheets of foam, our little shell of a boat tossing lightly as a
bubble. Then, rowing across a belt of back-flowing water, we found
ourselves on a smooth mirror reach between granite walls of the very
wildest and most exciting description, surpassing in some ways those of
the far-famed Yosemite Valley.

As we drifted silent and awe-stricken beneath the shadows of the mighty
cliffs, which, in their tremendous height and abruptness, seemed to
overhang at the top, the Indians gazing intently, as if they, too, were
impressed with the strange, awe-inspiring grandeur that shut them in,
one of them at length broke the silence by saying, â€œThis must be a good
place for woodchucks; I hear them calling.â€

When I asked them, further on, how they thought this gorge was made,
they gave up the question, but offered an opinion as to the formation
of rain and soil. The rain, they said, was produced by the rapid
whirling of the earth by a stout mythical being called Yek. The water
of the ocean was thus thrown up, to descend again in showers, just as
it is thrown off a wet grindstone. They did not, however, understand
why the ocean water should be salt, while the rain from it is fresh.
The soil, they said, for the plants to grow on is formed by the washing
of the rain on the rocks and gradually accumulating. The grinding
action of ice in this connection they had not recognized.

Gliding on and on, the scenery seemed at every turn to become more
lavishly fruitful in forms as well as more sublime in dimensionsâ€”snowy
falls booming in splendid dress; colossal domes and battle meets and
sculptured arches of a fine neutral-gray tint, their bases raved by the
blue fiord water; green ferny dells; bits of flower-bloom on ledges;
fringes of willow and birch; and glaciers above all. But when we
approached the base of a majestic rock like the Yosemite Half Dome at
the head of the fiord, where two short branches put out, and came in
sight of another glacier of the first order sending off bergs, our joy
was complete. I had a most glorious view of it, sweeping in grand
majesty from high mountain fountains, swaying around one mighty bastion
after another, until it fell into the fiord in shattered overleaning
fragments. When we had feasted awhile on this unhoped-for treasure, I
directed the Indians to pull to the head of the left fork of the fiord,
where we found a large cascade with a volume of water great enough to
be called a river, doubtless the outlet of a receding glacier not in
sight from the fiord.

This is in form and origin a typical Yosemite valley, though as yet its
floor is covered with ice and water,â€”ice above and beneath, a noble
mansion in which to spend a winter and a summer! It is about ten miles
long, and from three quarters of a mile to one mile wide. It contains
ten large falls and cascades, the finest one on the left side near the
head. After coming in an admirable rush over a granite brow where it is
first seen at a height of nine hundred or a thousand feet, it leaps a
sheer precipice of about two hundred and fifty feet, then divides and
reaches the tide-water in broken rapids over boulders. Another about a
thousand feet high drops at once on to the margin of the glacier two
miles back from the front. Several of the others are upwards of three
thousand feet high, descending through narrow gorges as richly
feathered with ferns as any channel that water ever flowed in, though
tremendously abrupt and deep. A grander array of rocks and waterfalls I
have never yet beheld in Alaska.

The amount of timber on the walls is about the same as that on the
Yosemite walls, but owing to greater moisture, there is more small
vegetation,â€”bushes, ferns, mosses, grasses, etc.; though by far the
greater portion of the area of the wall-surface is bare and shining
with the polish it received when occupied by the glacier that formed
the fiord. The deep-green patches seen on the mountains back of the
walls at the limits of vegetation are grass, where the wild goats, or
chamois rather, roam and feed. The still greener and more luxuriant
patches farther down in gullies and on slopes where the declivity is
not excessive, are made up mostly of willows, birch, and huckleberry
bushes, with a varying amount of prickly ribes and rubus and
echinopanax. This growth, when approached, especially on the lower
slopes near the level of the sea at the jaws of the great side caÃ±ons,
is found to be the most impenetrable and tedious and toilsome
combination of fighting bushes that the weary explorer ever fell into,
incomparably more punishing than the buckthorn and manzanita tangles of
the Sierra.

The cliff gardens of this hidden Yosemite are exceedingly rich in
color. On almost every rift and bench, however small, as well as on the
wider table-rocks where a little soil has lodged, we found gay
multitudes of flowers, far more brilliantly colored than would be
looked for in so cool and beclouded a region,â€”larkspurs, geraniums,
painted-cups, bluebells, gentians, saxifrages, epilobiums, violets,
parnassia, veratrum, spiranthes and other orchids, fritillaria, smilax,
asters, daisies, bryanthus, cassiope, linnÃ¦a, and a great variety of
flowering ribes and rubus and heathworts. Many of the above, though
with soft stems and leaves, are yet as brightly painted as those of the
warm sunlands of the south. The heathworts in particular are very
abundant and beautiful, both in flower and fruit, making delicate green
carpets for the rocks, flushed with pink bells, or dotted with red and
blue berries. The tallest of the grasses have ribbon leaves well
tempered and arched, and with no lack of bristly spikes and nodding
purple panicles. The alpine grasses of the Sierra, making close carpets
on the glacier meadows, I have not yet seen in Alaska.

The ferns are less numerous in species than in California, but about
equal in the number of fronds. I have seen three aspidiums, two
woodsias, a lomaria, polypodium, cheilanthes, and several species of
pteris.

In this eastern arm of Sum Dum Bay and its Yosemite branch, I counted
from my canoe, on my way up and down, thirty small glaciers back of the
walls, and we saw three of the first order; also thirty-seven cascades
and falls, counting only those large enough to make themselves heard
several miles. The whole bay, with its rocks and woods and ice,
reverberates with their roar. How many glaciers may be disclosed in the
other great arm that I have not seen as yet, I cannot say, but, judging
from the bergs it sends down, I guess not less than a hundred pour
their turbid streams into the fiord, making about as many joyful,
bouncing cataracts.

About noon we began to retrace our way back into the main fiord, and
arrived at the gold-mine camp after dark, rich and weary.

On the morning of August 21 I set out with my three Indians to explore
the right arm of this noble bay, Mr. Young having decided, on account
of mission work, to remain at the gold-mine. So here is another fine
lot of Sum Dum ice,â€”thirty-five or forty square miles of bergs, one
great glacier of the first class descending into the fiord at the head,
the fountain whence all these bergs were derived, and thirty-one
smaller glaciers that do not reach tidewater; also nine cascades and
falls, large size, and two rows of Yosemite rocks from three to four
thousand feet high, each row about eighteen or twenty miles long,
burnished and sculptured in the most telling glacier style, and well
trimmed with spruce groves and flower gardens; aâ€™ that and more of a
kind that cannot here be catalogued.

For the first five or six miles there is nothing excepting the icebergs
that is very striking in the scenery as compared with that of the
smooth unencumbered outside channels, where all is so evenly beautiful.
The mountain-wall on the right as you go up is more precipitous than
usual, and a series of small glaciers is seen along the top of it,
extending their blue-crevassed fronts over the rims of pure-white snow
fountains, and from the end of each front a hearty stream coming in a
succession of falls and rapids over the terminal moraines, through
patches of dwarf willows, and then through the spruce woods into the
bay, singing and dancing all the way down. On the opposite side of the
bay from here there is a small side bay about three miles deep, with a
showy group of glacier-bearing mountains back of it. Everywhere else
the view is bounded by comparatively low mountains densely forested to
the very top.

After sailing about six miles from the mine, the experienced
mountaineer could see some evidence of an opening from this wide lower
portion, and on reaching it, it proved to be the continuation of the
main west arm, contracted between stupendous walls of gray granite, and
crowded with bergs from shore to shore, which seem to bar the way
against everything but wings. Headland after headland, in most imposing
array, was seen plunging sheer and bare from dizzy heights, and
planting its feet in the ice-encumbered water without leaving a spot on
which one could land from a boat, while no part of the great glacier
that pours all these miles of ice into the fiord was visible. Pushing
our way slowly through the packed bergs, and passing headland after
headland, looking eagerly forward, the glacier and its fountain
mountains were still beyond sight, cut off by other projecting headland
capes, toward which I urged my way, enjoying the extraordinary grandeur
of the wild unfinished Yosemite. Domes swell against the sky in fine
lines as lofty and as perfect in form as those of the California
valley, and rock-fronts stand forward, as sheer and as nobly
sculptured. No ice-work that I have ever seen surpasses this, either in
the magnitude of the features or effectiveness of composition.

On some of the narrow benches and tables of the walls rows of spruce
trees and two-leaved pines were growing, and patches of considerable
size were found on the spreading bases of those mountains that stand
back inside the caÃ±ons, where the continuity of the walls is broken.
Some of these side caÃ±ons are cut down to the level of the water and
reach far back, opening views into groups of glacier fountains that
give rise to many a noble stream; while all along the tops of the walls
on both sides small glaciers are seen, still busily engaged in the work
of completing their sculpture. I counted twenty-five from the canoe.
Probably the drainage of fifty or more pours into this fiord. The
average elevation at which they melt is about eighteen hundred feet
above sea-level, and all of them are residual branches of the grand
trunk that filled the fiord and overflowed its walls when there was
only one Sum Dum glacier.

The afternoon was wearing away as we pushed on and on through the
drifting bergs without our having obtained a single glimpse of the
great glacier. A Sum Dum seal-hunter, whom we met groping his way
deftly through the ice in a very small, unsplitable cottonwood canoe,
told us that the ice-mountain was yet fifteen miles away. This was
toward the middle of the afternoon, and I gave up sketching and making
notes and worked hard with the Indians to reach it before dark. About
seven oâ€™clock we approached what seemed to be the extreme head of the
fiord, and still no great glacier in sightâ€”only a small one, three or
four miles long, melting a thousand feet above the sea. Presently, a
narrow side opening appeared between tremendous cliffs sheer to a
height of four thousand feet or more, trending nearly at right angles
to the general trend of the fiord, and apparently terminated by a
cliff, scarcely less abrupt or high, at a distance of a mile or two. Up
this bend we toiled against wind and tide, creeping closely along the
wall on the right side, which, as we looked upward, seemed to be
leaning over, while the waves beating against the bergs and rocks made
a discouraging kind of music. At length, toward nine oâ€™clock, just
before the gray darkness of evening fell, a long, triumphant shout told
that the glacier, so deeply and desperately hidden, was at last hunted
back to its benmost bore. A short distance around a second bend in the
caÃ±on, I reached a point where I obtained a good view of it as it pours
its deep, broad flood into the fiord in a majestic course from between
the noble mountains, its tributaries, each of which would be regarded
elsewhere as a grand glacier, converging from right and left from a
fountain set far in the silent fastnesses of the mountains.

â€œThere is your lost friend,â€ said the Indians laughing; â€œhe says,
â€˜Sagh-a-yaâ€™â€ (how do you do)? And while berg after berg was being born
with thundering uproar, Tyeen said, â€œYour friend has klosh tumtum (good
heart). Hear! Like the other big-hearted one he is firing his guns in
your honor.â€

I stayed only long enough to make an outline sketch, and then urged the
Indians to hasten back some six miles to the mouth of a side caÃ±on I
had noted on the way up as a place where we might camp in case we
should not find a better. After dark we had to move with great caution
through the ice. One of the Indians was stationed in the bow with a
pole to push aside the smaller fragments and look out for the most
promising openings, through which he guided us, shouting, â€œFriday!
Tucktay!â€ (shoreward, seaward) about ten times a minute. We reached
this landing-place after ten oâ€™clock, guided in the darkness by the
roar of a glacier torrent. The ground was all boulders and it was hard
to find a place among them, however small, to lie on. The Indians
anchored the canoe well out from the shore and passed the night in it
to guard against berg-waves and drifting waves, after assisting me to
set my tent in some sort of way among the stones well back beyond the
reach of the tide. I asked them as they were returning to the canoe if
they were not going to eat something. They answered promptly:â€”

â€œWe will sleep now, if your ice friend will let us. We will eat
to-morrow, but we can find some bread for you if you want it.â€

â€œNo,â€ I said, â€œgo to rest. I, too, will sleep now and eat to-morrow.â€
Nothing was attempted in the way of light or fire. Camping that night
was simply lying down. The boulders seemed to make a fair bed after
finding the best place to take their pressure.

During the night I was awakened by the beating of the spent ends of
berg-waves against the side of my tent, though I had fancied myself
well beyond their reach. These special waves are not raised by wind or
tide, but by the fall of large bergs from the snout of the glacier, or
sometimes by the overturning or breaking of large bergs that may have
long floated in perfect poise. The highest berg-waves oftentimes travel
half a dozen miles or farther before they are much spent, producing a
singularly impressive uproar in the far recesses of the mountains on
calm dark nights when all beside is still. Far and near they tell the
news that a berg is born, repeating their story again and again,
compelling attention and reminding us of earthquake-waves that roll on
for thousands of miles, taking their story from continent to continent.

When the Indians came ashore in the morning and saw the condition of my
tent they laughed heartily and said, â€œYour friend [meaning the big
glacier] sent you a good word last night, and his servant knocked at
your tent and said, â€˜Sagh-a-ya, are you sleeping well?â€™â€

I had fasted too long to be in very good order for hard work, but while
the Indians were cooking, I made out to push my way up the caÃ±on before
breakfast to seek the glacier that once came into the fiord, knowing
from the size and muddiness of the stream that drains it that it must
be quite large and not far off. I came in sight of it after a hard
scramble of two hours through thorny chaparral and across steep
avalanche taluses of rocks and snow. The front reaches across the caÃ±on
from wall to wall, covered with rocky detritus, and looked dark and
forbidding in the shadow cast by the cliffs, while from a low, cavelike
hollow its draining stream breaks forth, a river in size, with a
reverberating roar that stirs all the caÃ±on. Beyond, in a cloudless
blaze of sunshine, I saw many tributaries, pure and white as new-fallen
snow, drawing their sources from clusters of peaks and sweeping down
waving slopes to unite their crystal currents with the trunk glacier in
the central caÃ±on. This fine glacier reaches to within two hundred and
fifty feet of the level of the sea, and would even yet reach the fiord
and send off bergs but for the waste it suffers in flowing slowly
through the trunk caÃ±on, the declivity of which is very slight.

Returning, I reached camp and breakfast at ten oâ€™clock; then had
everything packed into the canoe, and set off leisurely across the
fiord to the mouth of another wide and low caÃ±on, whose lofty outer
cliffs, facing the fiord, are telling glacial advertisements. Gladly I
should have explored it all, traced its streams of water and streams of
ice, and entered its highest chambers, the homes and fountains of the
snow. But I had to wait. I only stopped an hour or two, and climbed to
the top of a rock through the common underbrush, whence I had a good
general view. The front of the main glacier is not far distant from the
fiord, and sends off small bergs into a lake. The walls of its
tributary caÃ±ons are remarkably jagged and high, cut in a red
variegated rock, probably slate. On the way back to the canoe I
gathered ripe salmon-berries an inch and a half in diameter, ripe
huckleberries, too, in great abundance, and several interesting plants
I had not before met in the territory.

About noon, when the tide was in our favor, we set out on the return
trip to the gold-mine camp. The sun shone free and warm. No wind
stirred. The water spaces between the bergs were as smooth as glass,
reflecting the unclouded sky, and doubling the ravishing beauty of the
bergs as the sunlight streamed through their innumerable angles in
rainbow colors.

Soon a light breeze sprang up, and dancing lily spangles on the water
mingled their glory of light with that burning on the angles of the
ice.

On days like this, true sun-days, some of the bergs show a purplish
tinge, though most are white from the disintegrating of their weathered
surfaces. Now and then a new-born one is met that is pure blue crystal
throughout, freshly broken from the fountain or recently exposed to the
air by turning over. But in all of them, old and new, there are azure
caves and rifts of ineffable beauty, in which the purest tones of light
pulse and shimmer, lovely and untainted as anything on earth or in the
sky.

As we were passing the Indian village I presented a little tobacco to
the headmen as an expression of regard, while they gave us a few smoked
salmon, after putting many questions concerning my exploration of their
bay and bluntly declaring their disbelief in the ice business.

About nine oâ€™clock we arrived at the gold camp, where we found Mr.
Young ready to go on with us the next morning, and thus ended two of
the brightest and best of all my Alaska days.




Chapter XV
From Taku River to Taylor Bay


I never saw Alaska looking better than it did when we bade farewell to
Sum Dum on August 22 and pushed on northward up the coast toward Taku.
The morning was clear, calm, brightâ€”not a cloud in all the purple sky,
nor wind, however gentle, to shake the slender spires of the spruces or
dew-laden grass around the shores. Over the mountains and over the
broad white bosoms of the glaciers the sunbeams poured, rosy as ever
fell on fields of ripening wheat, drenching the forests and kindling
the glassy waters and icebergs into a perfect blaze of colored light.
Every living thing seemed joyful, and natureâ€™s work was going on in
glowing enthusiasm, not less appreciable in the deep repose that
brooded over every feature of the landscape, suggesting the coming
fruitfulness of the icy land and showing the advance that has already
been made from glacial winter to summer. The care-laden commercial
lives we lead close our eyes to the operations of God as a workman,
though openly carried on that all who will look may see. The scarred
rocks here and the moraines make a vivid showing of the old winter-time
of the glacial period, and mark the bounds of the _mer-de-glace_ that
once filled the bay and covered the surrounding mountains. Already that
sea of ice is replaced by water, in which multitudes of fishes are fed,
while the hundred glaciers lingering about the bay and the streams that
pour from them are busy night and day bringing in sand and mud and
stones, at the rate of tons every minute, to fill it up. Then, as the
seasons grow warmer, there will be fields here for the plough.

Our Indians, exhilarated by the sunshine, were garrulous as the gulls
and plovers, and pulled heartily at their oars, evidently glad to get
out of the ice with a whole boat.

â€œNow for Taku,â€ they said, as we glided over the shining water.
â€œGood-bye, Ice-Mountains; good-bye, Sum Dum.â€ Soon a light breeze came,
and they unfurled the sail and laid away their oars and began, as usual
in such free times, to put their goods in order, unpacking and sunning
provisions, guns, ropes, clothing, etc. Joe has an old flintlock musket
suggestive of Hudsonâ€™s Bay times, which he wished to discharge and
reload. So, stepping in front of the sail, he fired at a gull that was
flying past before I could prevent him, and it fell slowly with
outspread wings alongside the canoe, with blood dripping from its bill.
I asked him why he had killed the bird, and followed the question by a
severe reprimand for his stupid cruelty, to which he could offer no
other excuse than that he had learned from the whites to be careless
about taking life. Captain Tyeen denounced the deed as likely to bring
bad luck.

Before the whites came most of the Thlinkits held, with Agassiz, that
animals have souls, and that it was wrong and unlucky to even speak
disrespectfully of the fishes or any of the animals that supplied them
with food. A case illustrating their superstitious beliefs in this
connection occurred at Fort Wrangell while I was there the year before.
One of the sub-chiefs of the Stickeens had a little son five or six
years old, to whom he was very much attached, always taking him with
him in his short canoe-trips, and leading him by the hand while going
about town. Last summer the boy was taken sick, and gradually grew weak
and thin, whereupon his father became alarmed, and feared, as is usual
in such obscure cases, that the boy had been bewitched. He first
applied in his trouble to Dr. Carliss, one of the missionaries, who
gave medicine, without effecting the immediate cure that the fond
father demanded. He was, to some extent, a believer in the powers of
missionaries, both as to material and spiritual affairs, but in so
serious an exigency it was natural that he should go back to the faith
of his fathers. Accordingly, he sent for one of the shamans, or
medicine-men, of his tribe, and submitted the case to him, who, after
going through the customary incantations, declared that he had
discovered the cause of the difficulty.

â€œYour boy,â€ he said, â€œhas lost his soul, and this is the way it
happened. He was playing among the stones down on the beach when he saw
a crawfish in the water, and made fun of it, pointing his finger at it
and saying, â€˜Oh, you crooked legs! Oh, you crooked legs! You canâ€™t walk
straight; you go sidewise,â€™ which made the crab so angry that he
reached out his long nippers, seized the ladâ€™s soul, pulled it out of
him and made off with it into deep water. And,â€ continued the
medicine-man, â€œunless his stolen soul is restored to him and put back
in its place he will die. Your boy is really dead already; it is only
his lonely, empty body that is living now, and though it may continue
to live in this way for a year or two, the boy will never be of any
account, not strong, nor wise, nor brave.â€

The father then inquired whether anything could be done about it; was
the soul still in possession of the crab, and if so, could it be
recovered and re-installed in his forlorn son? Yes, the doctor rather
thought it might be charmed back and re-united, but the job would be a
difficult one, and would probably cost about fifteen blankets.

After we were fairly out of the bay into Stephens Passage, the wind
died away, and the Indians had to take to their oars again, which ended
our talk. On we sped over the silvery level, close alongshore. The dark
forests extending far and near, planted like a field of wheat, might
seem monotonous in general views, but the appreciative observer,
looking closely, will find no lack of interesting variety, however far
he may go. The steep slopes on which they grow allow almost every
individual tree, with its peculiarities of form and color, to be seen
like an audience on seats rising above one anotherâ€”the blue-green,
sharply tapered spires of the Menzies spruce, the warm yellow-green
Mertens spruce with their finger-like tops all pointing in the same
direction, or drooping gracefully like leaves of grass, and the airy,
feathery, brownish-green Alaska cedar. The outer fringe of bushes along
the shore and hanging over the brows of the cliffs, the white mountains
above, the shining water beneath, the changing sky over all, form
pictures of divine beauty in which no healthy eye may ever grow weary.

Toward evening at the head of a picturesque bay we came to a village
belonging to the Taku tribe. We found it silent and deserted. Not a
single shaman or policeman had been left to keep it. These people are
so happily rich as to have but little of a perishable kind to keep,
nothing worth fretting about. They were away catching salmon, our
Indians said. All the Indian villages hereabout are thus abandoned at
regular periods every year, just as a tent is left for a day, while
they repair to fishing, berrying, and hunting stations, occupying each
in succession for a week or two at a time, coming and going from the
main, substantially built villages. Then, after their summerâ€™s work is
done, the winter supply of salmon dried and packed, fish-oil and
seal-oil stored in boxes, berries and spruce bark pressed into cakes,
their trading-trips completed, and the yearâ€™s stock of quarrels with
the neighboring tribe patched up in some way, they devote themselves to
feasting, dancing, and hootchenoo drinking. The Takus, once a powerful
and warlike tribe, were at this time, like most of the neighboring
tribes, whiskied nearly out of existence. They had a larger village on
the Taku River, but, according to the census taken that year by the
missionaries, they numbered only 269 in all,â€”109 men, 79 women, and 81
children, figures that show the vanishing condition of the tribe at a
glance.

Our Indians wanted to camp for the night in one of the deserted houses,
but I urged them on into the clean wilderness until dark, when we
landed on a rocky beach fringed with devilâ€™s-clubs, greatly to the
disgust of our crew. We had to make the best of it, however, as it was
too dark to seek farther. After supper was accomplished among the
boulders, they retired to the canoe, which they anchored a little way
out, beyond low tide, while Mr. Young and I at the expense of a good
deal of scrambling and panax stinging, discovered a spot on which we
managed to sleep.

The next morning, about two hours after leaving our thorny camp, we
rounded a great mountain rock nearly a mile in height and entered the
Taku fiord. It is about eighteen miles long and from three to five
miles wide, and extends directly back into the heart of the mountains,
draining hundreds of glaciers and streams. The ancient glacier that
formed it was far too deep and broad and too little concentrated to
erode one of those narrow caÃ±ons, usually so impressive in sculpture
and architecture, but it is all the more interesting on this account
when the grandeur of the ice work accomplished is recognized. This
fiord, more than any other I have examined, explains the formation of
the wonderful system of channels extending along the coast from Puget
Sound to about latitude 59 degrees, for it is a marked portion of the
system,â€”a branch of Stephens Passage. Its trends and general sculpture
are as distinctly glacial as those of the narrowest fiord, while the
largest tributaries of the great glacier that occupied it are still in
existence. I counted some forty-five altogether, big and little, in
sight from the canoe in sailing up the middle of the fiord. Three of
them, drawing their sources from magnificent groups of snowy mountains,
came down to the level of the sea and formed a glorious spectacle. The
middle one of the three belongs to the first class, pouring its
majestic flood, shattered and crevassed, directly into the fiord, and
crowding about twenty-five square miles of it with bergs. The next
below it also sends off bergs occasionally, though a narrow strip of
glacial detritus separates it from the tidewater. That forenoon a large
mass fell from it, damming its draining stream, which at length broke
the dam, and the resulting flood swept forward thousands of small bergs
across the mud-flat into the fiord. In a short time all was quiet
again; the flood-waters receded, leaving only a large blue scar on the
front of the glacier and stranded bergs on the moraine flat to tell the
tale.

These two glaciers are about equal in sizeâ€”two miles wideâ€”and their
fronts are only about a mile and a half apart. While I sat sketching
them from a point among the drifting icebergs where I could see far
back into the heart of their distant fountains, two Taku seal-hunters,
father and son, came gliding toward us in an extremely small canoe.
Coming alongside with a goodnatured â€œSagh-a-ya,â€ they inquired who we
were, our objects, etc., and gave us information about the river, their
village, and two other large glaciers that descend nearly to the
sea-level a few miles up the river caÃ±on. Crouching in their little
shell of a boat among the great bergs, with paddle and barbed spear,
they formed a picture as arctic and remote from anything to be found in
civilization as ever was sketched for us by the explorers of the Far
North.

Making our way through the crowded bergs to the extreme head of the
fiord, we entered the mouth of the river, but were soon compelled to
turn back on account of the strength of the current. The Taku River is
a large stream, nearly a mile wide at the mouth, and, like the
Stickeen, Chilcat, and Chilcoot, draws its sources from far inland,
crossing the mountain-chain from the interior through a majestic caÃ±on,
and draining a multitude of glaciers on its way.

The Taku Indians, like the Chilcats, with a keen appreciation of the
advantages of their position for trade, hold possession of the river
and compel the Indians of the interior to accept their services as
middle-men, instead of allowing them to trade directly with the whites.

When we were baffled in our attempt to ascend the river, the day was
nearly done, and we began to seek a camp-ground. After sailing two or
three miles along the left side of the fiord, we were so fortunate as
to find a small nook described by the two Indians, where firewood was
abundant, and where we could drag our canoe up the bank beyond reach of
the berg-waves. Here we were safe, with a fine outlook across the fiord
to the great glaciers and near enough to see the birth of the icebergs
and the wonderful commotion they make, and hear their wild, roaring
rejoicing. The sunset sky seemed to have been painted for this one
mountain mansion, fitting it like a ceiling. After the fiord was in
shadow the level sunbeams continued to pour through the miles of bergs
with ravishing beauty, reflecting and refracting the purple light like
cut crystal. Then all save the tips of the highest became dead white.
These, too, were speedily quenched, the glowing points vanishing like
stars sinking beneath the horizon. And after the shadows had crept
higher, submerging the glaciers and the ridges between them, the divine
alpenglow still lingered on their highest fountain peaks as they stood
transfigured in glorious array. Now the last of the twilight purple has
vanished, the stars begin to shine, and all trace of the day is gone.
Looking across the fiord the water seems perfectly black, and the two
great glaciers are seen stretching dim and ghostly into the shadowy
mountains now darkly massed against the starry sky.

Next morning it was raining hard, everything looked dismal, and on the
way down the fiord a growling head wind battered the rain in our faces,
but we held doggedly on and by 10 A.M. got out of the fiord into
Stephens Passage. A breeze sprung up in our favor that swept us bravely
on across the passage and around the end of Admiralty Island by dark.
We camped in a boggy hollow on a bluff among scraggy, usnea-bearded
spruces. The rain, bitterly cold and driven by a stormy wind, thrashed
us well while we floundered in the stumpy bog trying to make a fire and
supper.

When daylight came we found our camp-ground a very savage place. How we
reached it and established ourselves in the thick darkness it would be
difficult to tell. We crept along the shore a few miles against strong
head winds, then hoisted sail and steered straight across Lynn Canal to
the mainland, which we followed without great difficulty, the wind
having moderated toward evening. Near the entrance to Icy Strait we met
a Hoona who had seen us last year and who seemed glad to see us. He
gave us two salmon, and we made him happy with tobacco and then pushed
on and camped near Sitka Jackâ€™s deserted village.

Though the wind was still ahead next morning, we made about twenty
miles before sundown and camped on the west end of Farewell Island. We
bumped against a hidden rock and sprung a small leak that was easily
stopped with resin. The salmon-berries were ripe. While climbing a
bluff for a view of our course, I discovered moneses, one of my
favorites, and saw many well-traveled deer-trails, though the island is
cut off from the mainland and other islands by at least five or six
miles of icy, berg-encumbered water.

We got under way early next day,â€”a gray, cloudy morning with rain and
wind. Fair and head winds were about evenly balanced throughout the
day. Tides run fast here, like great rivers. We rowed and paddled
around Point Wimbledon against both wind and tide, creeping close to
the feet of the huge, bold rocks of the north wall of Cross Sound,
which here were very steep and awe-inspiring as the heavy swells from
the open sea coming in past Cape Spencer dashed white against them,
tossing our frail canoe up and down lightly as a feather. The point
reached by vegetation shows that the surf dashes up to a height of
about seventy-five or a hundred feet. We were awe-stricken and began to
fear that we might be upset should the ocean waves rise still higher.
But little Stickeen seemed to enjoy the storm, and gazed at the
foam-wreathed cliffs like a dreamy, comfortable tourist admiring a
sunset. We reached the mouth of Taylor Bay about two or three oâ€™clock
in the afternoon, when we had a view of the open ocean before we
entered the bay. Many large bergs from Glacier Bay were seen drifting
out to sea past Cape Spencer. We reached the head of the fiord now
called Taylor Bay at five oâ€™clock and camped near an immense glacier
with a front about three miles wide stretching across from wall to
wall. No icebergs are discharged from it, as it is separated from the
water of the fiord at high tide by a low, smooth mass of outspread,
overswept moraine material, netted with torrents and small shallow
rills from the glacier-front, with here and there a lakelet, and
patches of yellow mosses and garden spots bright with epilobium,
saxifrage, grass-tufts, sedges, and creeping willows on the higher
ground. But only the mosses were sufficiently abundant to make
conspicuous masses of color to relieve the dull slaty gray of the
glacial mud and gravel. The front of the glacier, like all those which
do not discharge icebergs, is rounded like a brow, smooth-looking in
general views, but cleft and furrowed, nevertheless, with chasms and
grooves in which the light glows and shimmers in glorious beauty. The
granite walls of the fiord, though very high, are not deeply
sculptured. Only a few deep side caÃ±ons with trees, bushes, grassy and
flowery spots interrupt their massive simplicity, leaving but few of
the cliffs absolutely sheer and bare like those of Yosemite, Sum Dum,
or Taku. One of the side caÃ±ons is on the left side of the fiord, the
other on the right, the tributaries of the former leading over by a
narrow tide-channel to the bay next to the eastward, and by a short
portage over into a lake into which pours a branch glacier from the
great glacier. Still another branch from the main glacier turns to the
right. Counting all three of these separate fronts, the width of this
great Taylor Bay Glacier must be about seven or eight miles.

While camp was being made, Hunter Joe climbed the eastern wall in
search of wild mutton, but found none. He fell in with a brown bear,
however, and got a shot at it, but nothing more. Mr. Young and I
crossed the moraine slope, splashing through pools and streams up to
the ice-wall, and made the interesting discovery that the glacier had
been advancing of late years, ploughing up and shoving forward moraine
soil that had been deposited long ago, and overwhelming and grinding
and carrying away the forests on the sides and front of the glacier.
Though not now sending off icebergs, the front is probably far below
sea-level at the bottom, thrust forward beneath its wave-washed
moraine.

Along the base of the mountain-wall we found abundance of
salmon-berries, the largest measuring an inch and a half in diameter.
Strawberries, too, are found hereabouts. Some which visiting Indians
brought us were as fine in size and color and flavor as any I ever saw
anywhere. After wandering and wondering an hour or two, admiring the
magnificent rock and crystal scenery about us, we returned to camp at
sundown, planning a grand excursion for the morrow.

I set off early the morning of August 30 before any one else in camp
had stirred, not waiting for breakfast, but only eating a piece of
bread. I had intended getting a cup of coffee, but a wild storm was
blowing and calling, and I could not wait. Running out against the
rain-laden gale and turning to catch my breath, I saw that the
ministerâ€™s little dog had left his bed in the tent and was coming
boring through the storm, evidently determined to follow me. I told him
to go back, that such a day as this had nothing for him.

â€œGo back,â€ I shouted, â€œand get your breakfast.â€ But he simply stood
with his head down, and when I began to urge my way again, looking
around, I saw he was still following me. So I at last told him to come
on if he must and gave him a piece of the bread I had in my pocket.

Instead of falling, the rain, mixed with misty shreds of clouds, was
flying in level sheets, and the wind was roaring as I had never heard
wind roar before. Over the icy levels and over the woods, on the
mountains, over the jagged rocks and spires and chasms of the glacier
it boomed and moaned and roared, filling the fiord in even, gray,
structureless gloom, inspiring and awful. I first struggled up in the
face of the blast to the east end of the ice-wall, where a patch of
forest had been carried away by the glacier when it was advancing. I
noticed a few stumps well out on the moraine flat, showing that its
present bare, raw condition was not the condition of fifty or a hundred
years ago. In front of this part of the glacier there is a small
moraine lake about half a mile in length, around the margin of which
are a considerable number of trees standing knee-deep, and of course
dead. This also is a result of the recent advance of the ice.

Pushing up through the ragged edge of the woods on the left margin of
the glacier, the storm seemed to increase in violence, so that it was
difficult to draw breath in facing it; therefore I took shelter back of
a tree to enjoy it and wait, hoping that it would at last somewhat
abate. Here the glacier, descending over an abrupt rock, falls forward
in grand cascades, while a stream swollen by the rain was now a
torrent,â€”wind, rain, ice-torrent, and water-torrent in one grand
symphony.

At length the storm seemed to abate somewhat, and I took off my heavy
rubber boots, with which I had waded the glacial streams on the flat,
and laid them with my overcoat on a log, where I might find them on my
way back, knowing I would be drenched anyhow, and firmly tied my
mountain shoes, tightened my belt, shouldered my ice-axe, and, thus
free and ready for rough work, pushed on, regardless as possible of
mere rain. Making my way up a steep granite slope, its projecting
polished bosses encumbered here and there by boulders and the ground
and bruised ruins of the ragged edge of the forest that had been
uprooted by the glacier during its recent advance, I traced the side of
the glacier for two or three miles, finding everywhere evidence of its
having encroached on the woods, which here run back along its edge for
fifteen or twenty miles. Under the projecting edge of this vast
ice-river I could see down beneath it to a depth of fifty feet or so in
some places, where logs and branches were being crushed to pulp, some
of it almost fine enough for paper, though most of it stringy and
coarse.

After thus tracing the margin of the glacier for three or four miles, I
chopped steps and climbed to the top, and as far as the eye could
reach, the nearly level glacier stretched indefinitely away in the gray
cloudy sky, a prairie of ice. The wind was now almost moderate, though
rain continued to fall, which I did not mind, but a tendency to mist in
the drooping draggled clouds made me hesitate about attempting to cross
to the opposite shore. Although the distance was only six or seven
miles, no traces at this time could be seen of the mountains on the
other side, and in case the sky should grow darker, as it seemed
inclined to do, I feared that when I got out of sight of land and
perhaps into a maze of crevasses I might find difficulty in winning a
way back.

Lingering a while and sauntering about in sight of the shore, I found
this eastern side of the glacier remarkably free from large crevasses.
Nearly all I met were so narrow I could step across them almost
anywhere, while the few wide ones were easily avoided by going up or
down along their sides to where they narrowed. The dismal cloud ceiling
showed rifts here and there, and, thus encouraged, I struck out for the
west shore, aiming to strike it five or six miles above the front wall,
cautiously taking compass bearings at short intervals to enable me to
find my way back should the weather darken again with mist or rain or
snow. The structure lines of the glacier itself were, however, my main
guide. All went well. I came to a deeply furrowed section about two
miles in width where I had to zigzag in long, tedious tacks and make
narrow doublings, tracing the edges of wide longitudinal furrows and
chasms until I could find a bridge connecting their sides, oftentimes
making the direct distance ten times over. The walking was good of its
kind, however, and by dint of patient doubling and axe-work on
dangerous places, I gained the opposite shore in about three hours, the
width of the glacier at this point being about seven miles.
Occasionally, while making my way, the clouds lifted a little,
revealing a few bald, rough mountains sunk to the throat in the broad,
icy sea which encompassed them on all sides, sweeping on forever and
forever as we count time, wearing them away, giving them the shape they
are destined to take when in the fullness of time they shall be parts
of new landscapes.

Ere I lost sight of the east-side mountains, those on the west came in
sight, so that holding my course was easy, and, though making haste, I
halted for a moment to gaze down into the beautiful pure blue crevasses
and to drink at the lovely blue wells, the most beautiful of all
Natureâ€™s water-basins, or at the rills and streams outspread over the
ice-land prairie, never ceasing to admire their lovely color and music
as they glided and swirled in their blue crystal channels and potholes,
and the rumbling of the moulins, or mills, where streams poured into
blue-walled pits of unknown depth, some of them as regularly circular
as if bored with augers. Interesting, too, were the cascades over blue
cliffs, where streams fell into crevasses or slid almost noiselessly
down slopes so smooth and frictionless their motion was concealed. The
round or oval wells, however, from one to ten feet wide, and from one
to twenty or thirty feet deep, were perhaps the most beautiful of all,
the water so pure as to be almost invisible. My widest views did not
probably exceed fifteen miles, the rain and mist making distances seem
greater.

On reaching the farther shore and tracing it a few miles to northward,
I found a large portion of the glacier-current sweeping out westward in
a bold and beautiful curve around the shoulder of a mountain as if
going direct to the open sea. Leaving the main trunk, it breaks into a
magnificent uproar of pinnacles and spires and up-heaving, splashing
wave-shaped masses, a crystal cataract incomparably greater and wilder
than a score of Niagaras.

Tracing its channel three or four miles, I found that it fell into a
lake, which it fills with bergs. The front of this branch of the
glacier is about three miles wide. I first took the lake to be the head
of an arm of the sea, but, going down to its shore and tasting it, I
found it fresh, and by my aneroid perhaps less than a hundred feet
above sea-level. It is probably separated from the sea only by a
moraine dam. I had not time to go around its shores, as it was now near
five oâ€™clock and I was about fifteen miles from camp, and I had to make
haste to recross the glacier before dark, which would come on about
eight oâ€™clock. I therefore made haste up to the main glacier, and,
shaping my course by compass and the structure lines of the ice, set
off from the land out on to the grand crystal prairie again. All was so
silent and so concentred, owing to the low dragging mist, the beauty
close about me was all the more keenly felt, though tinged with a dim
sense of danger, as if coming events were casting shadows. I was soon
out of sight of land, and the evening dusk that on cloudy days precedes
the real night gloom came stealing on and only ice was in sight, and
the only sounds, save the low rumbling of the mills and the rattle of
falling stones at long intervals, were the low, terribly earnest
moanings of the wind or distant waterfalls coming through the
thickening gloom. After two hours of hard work I came to a maze of
crevasses of appalling depth and width which could not be passed
apparently either up or down. I traced them with firm nerve developed
by the danger, making wide jumps, poising cautiously on dizzy edges
after cutting footholds, taking wide crevasses at a grand leap at once
frightful and inspiring. Many a mile was thus traveled, mostly up and
down the glacier, making but little real headway, running much of the
time as the danger of having to pass the night on the ice became more
and more imminent. This I could do, though with the weather and my
rain-soaked condition it would be trying at best. In treading the mazes
of this crevassed section I had frequently to cross bridges that were
only knife-edges for twenty or thirty feet, cutting off the sharp tops
and leaving them flat so that little Stickeen could follow me. These I
had to straddle, cutting off the top as I progressed and hitching
gradually ahead like a boy riding a rail fence. All this time the
little dog followed me bravely, never hesitating on the brink of any
crevasse that I had jumped, but now that it was becoming dark and the
crevasses became more troublesome, he followed close at my heels
instead of scampering far and wide, where the ice was at all smooth, as
he had in the forenoon. No land was now in sight. The mist fell lower
and darker and snow began to fly. I could not see far enough up and
down the glacier to judge how best to work out of the bewildering
labyrinth, and how hard I tried while there was yet hope of reaching
camp that night! a hope which was fast growing dim like the sky. After
dark, on such ground, to keep from freezing, I could only jump up and
down until morning on a piece of flat ice between the crevasses, dance
to the boding music of the winds and waters, and as I was already tired
and hungry I would be in bad condition for such ice work. Many times I
was put to my mettle, but with a firm-braced nerve, all the more
unflinching as the dangers thickened, I worked out of that terrible
ice-web, and with blood fairly up Stickeen and I ran over common danger
without fatigue. Our very hardest trial was in getting across the very
last of the sliver bridges. After examining the first of the two widest
crevasses, I followed its edge half a mile or so up and down and
discovered that its narrowest spot was about eight feet wide, which was
the limit of what I was able to jump. Moreover, the side I was onâ€”that
is, the west sideâ€”was about a foot higher than the other, and I feared
that in case I should be stopped by a still wider impassable crevasse
ahead that I would hardly be able to take back that jump from its lower
side. The ice beyond, however, as far as I could see it, looked
temptingly smooth. Therefore, after carefully making a socket for my
foot on the rounded brink, I jumped, but found that I had nothing to
spare and more than ever dreaded having to retrace my way. Little
Stickeen jumped this, however, without apparently taking a second look
at it, and we ran ahead joyfully over smooth, level ice, hoping we were
now leaving all danger behind us. But hardly had we gone a hundred or
two yards when to our dismay we found ourselves on the very widest of
all the longitudinal crevasses we had yet encountered. It was about
forty feet wide. I ran anxiously up the side of it to northward,
eagerly hoping that I could get around its head, but my worst fears
were realized when at a distance of about a mile or less it ran into
the crevasse that I had just jumped. I then ran down the edge for a
mile or more below the point where I had first met it, and found that
its lower end also united with the crevasse I had jumped, showing
dismally that we were on an island two or three hundred yards wide and
about two miles long and the only way of escape from this island was by
turning back and jumping again that crevasse which I dreaded, or
venturing ahead across the giant crevasse by the very worst of the
sliver bridges I had ever seen. It was so badly weathered and melted
down that it formed a knife-edge, and extended across from side to side
in a low, drooping curve like that made by a loose rope attached at
each end at the same height. But the worst difficulty was that the ends
of the down-curving sliver were attached to the sides at a depth of
about eight or ten feet below the surface of the glacier. Getting down
to the end of the bridge, and then after crossing it getting up the
other side, seemed hardly possible. However, I decided to dare the
dangers of the fearful sliver rather than to attempt to retrace my
steps. Accordingly I dug a low groove in the rounded edge for my knees
to rest in and, leaning over, began to cut a narrow foothold on the
steep, smooth side. When I was doing this, Stickeen came up behind me,
pushed his head over my shoulder, looked into the crevasses and along
the narrow knife-edge, then turned and looked in my face, muttering and
whining as if trying to say, â€œSurely you are not going down there.â€ I
said, â€œYes, Stickeen, this is the only way.â€ He then began to cry and
ran wildly along the rim of the crevasse, searching for a better way,
then, returning baffled, of course, he came behind me and lay down and
cried louder and louder.

After getting down one step I cautiously stooped and cut another and
another in succession until I reached the point where the sliver was
attached to the wall. There, cautiously balancing, I chipped down the
upcurved end of the bridge until I had formed a small level platform
about a foot wide, then, bending forward, got astride of the end of the
sliver, steadied myself with my knees, then cut off the top of the
sliver, hitching myself forward an inch or two at a time, leaving it
about four inches wide for Stickeen. Arrived at the farther end of the
sliver, which was about seventy-five feet long, I chipped another
little platform on its upcurved end, cautiously rose to my feet, and
with infinite pains cut narrow notch steps and finger-holds in the wall
and finally got safely across. All this dreadful time poor little
Stickeen was crying as if his heart was broken, and when I called to
him in as reassuring a voice as I could muster, he only cried the
louder, as if trying to say that he never, never could get down
thereâ€”the only time that the brave little fellow appeared to know what
danger was. After going away as if I was leaving him, he still howled
and cried without venturing to try to follow me. Returning to the edge
of the crevasse, I told him that I must go, that he could come if he
only tried, and finally in despair he hushed his cries, slid his little
feet slowly down into my footsteps out on the big sliver, walked slowly
and cautiously along the sliver as if holding his breath, while the
snow was falling and the wind was moaning and threatening to blow him
off. When he arrived at the foot of the slope below me, I was kneeling
on the brink ready to assist him in case he should be unable to reach
the top. He looked up along the row of notched steps I had made, as if
fixing them in his mind, then with a nervous spring he whizzed up and
passed me out on to the level ice, and ran and cried and barked and
rolled about fairly hysterical in the sudden revulsion from the depth
of despair to triumphant joy. I tried to catch him and pet him and tell
him how good and brave he was, but he would not be caught. He ran round
and round, swirling like autumn leaves in an eddy, lay down and rolled
head over heels. I told him we still had far to go and that we must now
stop all nonsense and get off the ice before dark. I knew by the
ice-lines that every step was now taking me nearer the shore and soon
it came in sight. The head-land four or five miles back from the front,
covered with spruce trees, loomed faintly but surely through the mist
and light fall of snow not more than two miles away. The ice now proved
good all the way across, and we reached the lateral moraine just at
dusk, then with trembling limbs, now that the danger was over, we
staggered and stumbled down the bouldery edge of the glacier and got
over the dangerous rocks by the cascades while yet a faint light
lingered. We were safe, and then, too, came limp weariness such as no
ordinary work ever produces, however hard it may be. Wearily we
stumbled down through the woods, over logs and brush and roots,
devilâ€™s-clubs pricking us at every faint blundering tumble. At last we
got out on the smooth mud slope with only a mile of slow but sure
dragging of weary limbs to camp. The Indians had been firing guns to
guide me and had a fine supper and fire ready, though fearing they
would be compelled to seek us in the morning, a care not often applied
to me. Stickeen and I were too tired to eat much, and, strange to say,
too tired to sleep. Both of us, springing up in the night again and
again, fancied we were still on that dreadful ice bridge in the shadow
of death.

Nevertheless, we arose next morning in newness of life. Never before
had rocks and ice and trees seemed so beautiful and wonderful, even the
cold, biting rainstorm that was blowing seemed full of loving-kindness,
wonderful compensation for all that we had endured, and we sailed down
the bay through the gray, driving rain rejoicing.




Chapter XVI
Glacier Bay


While Stickeen and I were away, a Hoona, one of the head men of the
tribe, paid Mr. Young a visit, and presented him with porpoise-meat and
berries and much interesting information. He naturally expected a
return visit, and when we called at his house, a mile or two down the
fiord, he said his wives were out in the rain gathering fresh berries
to complete a feast prepared for us. We remained, however, only a few
minutes, for I was not aware of this arrangement or of Mr. Youngâ€™s
promise until after leaving the house. Anxiety to get around Cape
Wimbledon was the cause of my haste, fearing the storm might increase.
On account of this ignorance, no apologies were offered him, and the
upshot was that the good Hoona became very angry. We succeeded,
however, in the evening of the same day, in explaining our haste, and
by sincere apologies and presents made peace.

After a hard struggle we got around stormy Wimbledon and into the next
fiord to the northward (Klunastucksanaâ€”Dundas Bay). A cold, drenching
rain was falling, darkening but not altogether hiding its extraordinary
beauty, made up of lovely reaches and side fiords, feathery headlands
and islands, beautiful every one and charmingly collocated. But how it
rained, and how cold it was, and how weary we were pulling most of the
time against the wind! The branches of this bay are so deep and so
numerous that, with the rain and low clouds concealing the mountain
landmarks, we could hardly make out the main trends. While groping and
gazing among the islands through the misty rain and clouds, we
discovered wisps of smoke at the foot of a sheltering rock in front of
a mountain, where a choir of cascades were chanting their rain songs.
Gladly we made for this camp, which proved to belong to a rare old
Hoona sub-chief, so tall and wide and dignified in demeanor he looked
grand even in the sloppy weather, and every inch a chief in spite of
his bare legs and the old shirt and draggled, ragged blanket in which
he was dressed. He was given to much handshaking, gripping hard,
holding on and looking you gravely in the face while most emphatically
speaking in Thlinkit, not a word of which we understood until
interpreter John came to our help. He turned from one to the other of
us, declaring, as John interpreted, that our presence did him good like
food and fire, that he would welcome white men, especially teachers,
and that he and all his people compared to ourselves were only
children. When Mr. Young informed him that a missionary was about to be
sent to his people, he said he would call them all together four times
and explain that a teacher and preacher were coming and that they
therefore must put away all foolishness and prepare their hearts to
receive them and their words. He then introduced his three children,
one a naked lad five or six years old who, as he fondly assured us,
would soon be a chief, and later to his wife, an intelligent-looking
woman of whom he seemed proud. When we arrived she was out at the foot
of the cascade mountain gathering salmon-berries. She came in dripping
and loaded. A few of the fine berries saved for the children she
presented, proudly and fondly beginning with the youngest, whose only
clothing was a nose-ring and a string of beads. She was lightly
appareled in a cotton gown and bit of blanket, thoroughly bedraggled,
but after unloading her berries she retired with a dry calico gown
around the corner of a rock and soon returned fresh as a daisy and with
becoming dignity took her place by the fireside. Soon two other
berry-laden women came in, seemingly enjoying the rain like the bushes
and trees. They put on little clothing so that they may be the more
easily dried, and as for the children, a thin shirt of sheeting is the
most they encumber themselves with, and get wet and half dry without
seeming to notice it while we shiver with two or three dry coats. They
seem to prefer being naked. The men also wear but little in wet
weather. When they go out for all day they put on a single blanket, but
in choring around camp, getting firewood, cooking, or looking after
their precious canvas, they seldom wear anything, braving wind and rain
in utter nakedness to avoid the bother of drying clothes. It is a rare
sight to see the children bringing in big chunks of firewood on their
shoulders, balancing in crossing boulders with firmly set bow-legs and
bulging back muscles.

We gave Ka-hood-oo-shough, the old chief, some tobacco and rice and
coffee, and pitched our tent near his hut among tall grass. Soon after
our arrival the Taylor Bay sub-chief came in from the opposite
direction from ours, telling us that he came through a cut-off passage
not on our chart. As stated above, we took pains to conciliate him and
soothe his hurt feelings. Our words and gifts, he said, had warmed his
sore heart and made him glad and comfortable.

The view down the bay among the islands was, I thought, the finest of
this kind of scenery that I had yet observed.

The weather continued cold and rainy. Nevertheless Mr. Young and I and
our crew, together with one of the Hoonas, an old man who acted as
guide, left camp to explore one of the upper arms of the bay, where we
were told there was a large glacier. We managed to push the canoe
several miles up the stream that drains the glacier to a point where
the swift current was divided among rocks and the banks were overhung
with alders and willows. I left the canoe and pushed up the right bank
past a magnificent waterfall some twelve hundred feet high, and over
the shoulder of a mountain, until I secured a good view of the lower
part of the glacier. It is probably a lobe of the Taylor Bay or Brady
Glacier.

On our return to camp, thoroughly drenched and cold, the old chief came
to visit us, apparently as wet and cold as ourselves.

â€œI have been thinking of you all day,â€ he said, â€œand pitying you,
knowing how miserable you were, and as soon as I saw your canoe coming
back I was ashamed to think that I had been sitting warm and dry at my
fire while you were out in the storm; therefore I made haste to strip
off my dry clothing and put on these wet rags to share your misery and
show how much I love you.â€

I had another long talk with Ka-hood-oo-shough the next day.

â€œI am not able,â€ he said, â€œto tell you how much good your words have
done me. Your words are good, and they are strong words. Some of my
people are foolish, and when they make their salmon-traps they do not
take care to tie the poles firmly together, and when the big
rain-floods come the traps break and are washed away because the people
who made them are foolish people. But your words are strong words and
when storms come to try them they will stand the storms.â€

There was much hand shaking as we took our leave and assurances of
eternal friendship. The grand old man stood on the shore watching us
and waving farewell until we were out of sight.

We now steered for the Muir Glacier and arrived at the front on the
east side the evening of the third, and camped on the end of the
moraine, where there was a small stream. Captain Tyeen was inclined to
keep at a safe distance from the tremendous threatening cliffs of the
discharging wall. After a good deal of urging he ventured within half a
mile of them, on the east side of the fiord, where with Mr. Young I
went ashore to seek a camp-ground on the moraine, leaving the Indians
in the canoe. In a few minutes after we landed a huge berg sprung aloft
with awful commotion, and the frightened Indians incontinently fled
down the fiord, plying their paddles with admirable energy in the
tossing waves until a safe harbor was reached around the south end of
the moraine. I found a good place for a camp in a slight hollow where a
few spruce stumps afforded firewood. But all efforts to get Tyeen out
of his harbor failed. â€œNobody knew,â€ he said, â€œhow far the angry ice
mountain could throw waves to break his canoe.â€ Therefore I had my
bedding and some provisions carried to my stump camp, where I could
watch the bergs as they were discharged and get night views of the brow
of the glacier and its sheer jagged face all the way across from side
to side of the channel. One night the water was luminous and the surge
from discharging icebergs churned the water into silver fire, a
glorious sight in the darkness. I also went back up the east side of
the glacier five or six miles and ascended a mountain between its first
two eastern tributaries, which, though covered with grass near the top,
was exceedingly steep and difficult. A bulging ridge near the top I
discovered was formed of ice, a remnant of the glacier when it stood at
this elevation which had been preserved by moraine material and later
by a thatch of dwarf bushes and grass.

Next morning at daybreak I pushed eagerly back over the comparatively
smooth eastern margin of the glacier to see as much as possible of the
upper fountain region. About five miles back from the front I climbed a
mountain twenty-five hundred feet high, from the flowery summit of
which, the day being clear, the vast glacier and its principal branches
were displayed in one magnificent view. Instead of a stream of ice
winding down a mountain-walled valley like the largest of the Swiss
glaciers, the Muir looks like a broad undulating prairie streaked with
medial moraines and gashed with crevasses, surrounded by numberless
mountains from which flow its many tributary glaciers. There are seven
main tributaries from ten to twenty miles long and from two to six
miles wide where they enter the trunk, each of them fed by many
secondary tributaries; so that the whole number of branches, great and
small, pouring from the mountain fountains perhaps number upward of two
hundred, not counting the smallest. The area drained by this one grand
glacier can hardly be less than seven or eight hundred miles, and
probably contains as much ice as all the eleven hundred Swiss glaciers
combined. Its length from the frontal wall back to the head of its
farthest fountain seemed to be about forty or fifty miles, and the
width just below the confluence of the main tributaries about
twenty-five miles. Though apparently motionless as the mountains, it
flows on forever, the speed varying in every part with the seasons, but
mostly with the depth of the current, and the declivity, smoothness and
directness of the different portions of the basin. The flow of the
central cascading portion near the front, as determined by Professor
Reid, is at the rate of from two and a half to five inches an hour, or
from five to ten feet a day. A strip of the main trunk about a mile in
width, extending along the eastern margin about fourteen miles to a
lake filled with bergs, has so little motion and is so little
interrupted by crevasses, a hundred horsemen might ride abreast over it
without encountering very much difficulty.

But far the greater portion of the vast expanse looking smooth in the
distance is torn and crumpled into a bewildering network of hummocky
ridges and blades, separated by yawning gulfs and crevasses, so that
the explorer, crossing it from shore to shore, must always have a hard
time. In hollow spots here and there in the heart of the icy wilderness
are small lakelets fed by swift-glancing streams that flow without
friction in blue shining channels, making delightful melody, singing
and ringing in silvery tones of peculiar sweetness, radiant crystals
like flowers ineffably fine growing in dazzling beauty along their
banks. Few, however, will be likely to enjoy them. Fortunately to most
travelers the thundering ice-wall, while comfortably accessible, is
also the most strikingly interesting portion of the glacier.

The mountains about the great glacier were also seen from this
standpoint in exceedingly grand and telling views, ranged and grouped
in glorious array. Along the valleys of the main tributaries to the
northwestward I saw far into their shadowy depths, one noble peak in
its snowy robes appearing beyond another in fine perspective. One of
the most remarkable of them, fashioned like a superb crown with
delicately fluted sides, stands in the middle of the second main
tributary, counting from left to right. To the westward the magnificent
Fairweather Range is displayed in all its glory, lifting its peaks and
glaciers into the blue sky. Mt. Fairweather, though not the highest, is
the noblest and most majestic in port and architecture of all the
sky-dwelling company. La PÃ©rouse, at the south end of the range, is
also a magnificent mountain, symmetrically peaked and sculptured, and
wears its robes of snow and glaciers in noble style. Lituya, as seen
from here, is an immense tower, severely plain and massive. It makes a
fine and terrible and lonely impression. Crillon, though the loftiest
of all (being nearly sixteen thousand feet high), presents no
well-marked features. Its ponderous glaciers have ground it away into
long, curling ridges until, from this point of view, it resembles a
huge twisted shell. The lower summits about the Muir Glacier, like this
one, the first that I climbed, are richly adorned and enlivened with
flowers, though they make but a faint show in general views. Lines and
dashes of bright green appear on the lower slopes as one approaches
them from the glacier, and a fainter green tinge may be noticed on the
subordinate summits at a height of two thousand or three thousand feet.
The lower are mostly alder bushes and the topmost a lavish profusion of
flowering plants, chiefly cassiope, vaccinium, pyrola, erigeron,
gentiana, campanula, anemone, larkspur, and columbine, with a few
grasses and ferns. Of these cassiope is at once the commonest and the
most beautiful and influential. In some places its delicate stems make
mattresses more than a foot thick over several acres, while the bloom
is so abundant that a single handful plucked at random contains
hundreds of its pale pink bells. The very thought of this Alaska garden
is a joyful exhilaration. Though the storm-beaten ground it is growing
on is nearly half a mile high, the glacier centuries ago flowed over it
as a river flows over a boulder; but out of all the cold darkness and
glacial crushing and grinding comes this warm, abounding beauty and
life to teach us that what we in our faithless ignorance and fear call
destruction is creation finer and finer.

When night was approaching I scrambled down out of my blessed garden to
the glacier, and returned to my lonely camp, and, getting some coffee
and bread, again went up the moraine to the east end of the great
ice-wall. It is about three miles long, but the length of the jagged,
berg-producing portion that stretches across the fiord from side to
side like a huge green-and-blue barrier is only about two miles and
rises above the water to a height of from two hundred and fifty to
three hundred feet. Soundings made by Captain Carroll show that seven
hundred and twenty feet of the wall is below the surface, and a third
unmeasured portion is buried beneath the moraine detritus deposited at
the foot of it. Therefore, were the water and rocky detritus cleared
away, a sheer precipice of ice would be presented nearly two miles long
and more than a thousand feet high. Seen from a distance, as you come
up the fiord, it seems comparatively regular in form, but it is far
otherwise; bold, jagged capes jut forward into the fiord, alternating
with deep reentering angles and craggy hollows with plain bastions,
while the top is roughened with innumerable spires and pyramids and
sharp hacked blades leaning and toppling or cutting straight into the
sky.

The number of bergs given off varies somewhat with the weather and the
tides, the average being about one every five or six minutes, counting
only those that roar loud enough to make themselves heard at a distance
of two or three miles. The very largest, however, may under favorable
conditions be heard ten miles or even farther. When a large mass sinks
from the upper fissured portion of the wall, there is first a keen,
prolonged, thundering roar, which slowly subsides into a low muttering
growl, followed by numerous smaller grating clashing sounds from the
agitated bergs that dance in the waves about the newcomer as if in
welcome; and these again are followed by the swash and roar of the
waves that are raised and hurled up the beach against the moraines. But
the largest and most beautiful of the bergs, instead of thus falling
from the upper weathered portion of the wall, rise from the submerged
portion with a still grander commotion, springing with tremendous voice
and gestures nearly to the top of the wall, tons of water streaming
like hair down their sides, plunging and rising again and again before
they finally settle in perfect poise, free at last, after having formed
part of the slow-crawling glacier for centuries. And as we contemplate
their history, as they sail calmly away down the fiord to the sea, how
wonderful it seems that ice formed from pressed snow on the far-off
mountains two or three hundred years ago should still be pure and
lovely in color after all its travel and toil in the rough mountain
quarries, grinding and fashioning the features of predestined
landscapes.

When sunshine is sifting through the midst of the multitude of icebergs
that fill the fiord and through the jets of radiant spray ever rising
from the tremendous dashing and splashing of the falling and
upspringing bergs, the effect is indescribably glorious. Glorious, too,
are the shows they make in the night when the moon and stars are
shining. The berg-thunder seems far louder than by day, and the
projecting buttresses seem higher as they stand forward in the pale
light, relieved by gloomy hollows, while the new-born bergs are dimly
seen, crowned with faint lunar rainbows in the up-dashing spray. But it
is in the darkest nights when storms are blowing and the waves are
phosphorescent that the most impressive displays are made. Then the
long range of ice-bluffs is plainly seen stretching through the gloom
in weird, unearthly splendor, luminous wave foam dashing against every
bluff and drifting berg; and ever and anon amid all this wild auroral
splendor some huge new-born berg dashes the living water into yet
brighter foam, and the streaming torrents pouring from its sides are
worn as robes of light, while they roar in awful accord with the winds
and waves, deep calling unto deep, glacier to glacier, from fiord to
fiord over all the wonderful bay.

After spending a few days here, we struck across to the main Hoona
village on the south side of Icy Strait, thence by a long cut-off with
one short portage to Chatham Strait, and thence down through Peril
Strait, sailing all night, hoping to catch the mail steamer at Sitka.
We arrived at the head of the strait about daybreak. The tide was
falling, and rushing down with the swift current as if descending a
majestic cataract was a memorable experience. We reached Sitka the same
night, and there I paid and discharged my crew, making allowance for a
couple of days or so for the journey back home to Fort Wrangell, while
I boarded the steamer for Portland and thus ended my explorations for
this season.




Part III
_The Trip of 1890_




Chapter XVII
In Camp at Glacier Bay


I left San Francisco for Glacier Bay on the steamer City of Pueblo,
June 14, 1890, at 10 A.M., this being my third trip to southeastern
Alaska and fourth to Alaska, including northern and western Alaska as
far as Unalaska and Pt. Barrow and the northeastern coast of Siberia.
The bar at the Golden Gate was smooth, the weather cool and pleasant.
The redwoods in sheltered coves approach the shore closely, their
dwarfed and shorn tops appearing here and there in ravines along the
coast up to Oregon. The wind-swept hills, beaten with scud, are of
course bare of trees. Along the Oregon and Washington coast the trees
get nearer the sea, for spruce and contorted pine endure the briny
winds better than the redwoods. We took the inside passage between the
shore and Race Rocks, a long range of islets on which many a good ship
has been wrecked. The breakers from the deep Pacific, driven by the
gale, made a glorious display of foam on the bald islet rocks, sending
spray over the tops of some of them a hundred feet high or more in
sublime, curving, jagged-edged and flame-shaped sheets. The gestures of
these upspringing, purple-tinged waves as they dashed and broke were
sublime and serene, combining displays of graceful beauty of motion and
form with tremendous powerâ€”a truly glorious show. I noticed several
small villages on the green slopes between the timbered mountains and
the shore. Long Beach made quite a display of new houses along the
beach, north of the mouth of the Columbia.

I had pleasant company on the Pueblo and sat at the chief engineerâ€™s
table, who was a good and merry talker. An old San Francisco lawyer,
rather stiff and dignified, knew my father-in-law, Dr. Strentzel. Three
ladies, opposed to the pitching of the ship, were absent from table the
greater part of the way. My best talker was an old Scandinavian
sea-captain, who was having a new bark built at Port Blakely,â€”an
interesting old salt, every sentence of his conversation flavored with
sea-brine, bluff and hearty as a sea-wave, keen-eyed, courageous,
self-reliant, and so stubbornly skeptical he refused to believe even in
glaciers.

â€œAfter you see your bark,â€ I said, â€œand find everything being done to
your mind, you had better go on to Alaska and see the glaciers.â€

â€œOh, I haf seen many glaciers already.â€

â€œBut are you sure that you know what a glacier is?â€ I asked.

â€œVell, a glacier is a big mountain all covered up vith ice.â€

â€œThen a river,â€ said I, â€œmust be a big mountain all covered with
water.â€

I explained what a glacier was and succeeded in exciting his interest.
I told him he must reform, for a man who neither believed in God nor
glaciers must be very bad, indeed the worst of all unbelievers.

At Port Townsend I met Mr. Loomis, who had agreed to go with me as far
as the Muir Glacier. We sailed from here on the steamer Queen. We
touched again at Victoria, and I took a short walk into the adjacent
woods and gardens and found the flowery vegetation in its glory,
especially the large wild rose for which the region is famous, and the
spirÃ¦a and English honeysuckle of the gardens.

_June 18_. We sailed from Victoria on the Queen at 10.30 A.M. The
weather all the way to Fort Wrangell was cloudy and rainy, but the
scenery is delightful even in the dullest weather. The marvelous wealth
of forests, islands, and waterfalls, the cloud-wreathed heights, the
many avalanche slopes and slips, the pearl-gray tones of the sky, the
browns of the woods, their purple flower edges and mist fringes, the
endless combinations of water and land and ever-shifting cloudsâ€”none of
these greatly interest the tourists. I noticed one of the small whales
that frequent these channels and mentioned the fact, then called
attention to a charming group of islands, but they turned their eyes
from the islands, saying, â€œYes, yes, they are very fine, but where did
you see the whale?â€

The timber is larger and apparently better every way as you go north
from Victoria, that is on the islands, perhaps on account of fires from
less rain to the southward. All the islands have been overswept by the
ice-sheet and are but little changed as yet, save a few of the highest
summits which have been sculptured by local residual glaciers. All have
approximately the form of greatest strength with reference to the
overflow of an ice-sheet, excepting those mentioned above, which have
been more or less eroded by local residual glaciers. Every channel also
has the form of greatest strength with reference to ice-action.
Islands, as we have seen, are still being born in Glacier Bay and
elsewhere to the northward.

I found many pleasant people aboard, but strangely ignorant on the
subject of earth-sculpture and landscape-making. Professor Niles, of
the Boston Institute of Technology, is aboard; also Mr. Russell and Mr.
Kerr of the Geological Survey, who are now on their way to Mt. St.
Elias, hoping to reach the summit; and a granddaughter of Peter
Burnett, the first governor of California.

We arrived at Wrangell in the rain at 10.30 P.M. There was a grand rush
on shore to buy curiosities and see totem poles. The shops were jammed
and mobbed, high prices paid for shabby stuff manufactured expressly
for tourist trade. Silver bracelets hammered out of dollars and half
dollars by Indian smiths are the most popular articles, then baskets,
yellow cedar toy canoes, paddles, etc. Most people who travel look only
at what they are directed to look at. Great is the power of the
guidebook-maker, however ignorant. I inquired for my old friends Tyeen
and Shakes, who were both absent.

_June 20_. We left Wrangell early this morning and passed through the
Wrangell Narrows at high tide. I noticed a few bergs near Cape Fanshawe
from Wrangell Glacier. The water ten miles from Wrangell is colored
with particles derived mostly from the Stickeen River glaciers and Le
Conte Glacier. All the waters of the channels north of Wrangell are
green or yellowish from glacier erosion. We had a good view of the
glaciers all the way to Juneau, but not of their high, cloud-veiled
fountains. The stranded bergs on the moraine bar at the mouth of Sum
Dum Bay looked just as they did when I first saw them ten years ago.

Before reaching Juneau, the Queen proceeded up the Taku Inlet that the
passengers might see the fine glacier at its head, and ventured to
within half a mile of the berg-discharging front, which is about three
quarters of a mile wide. Bergs fell but seldom, perhaps one in half an
hour. The glacier makes a rapid descent near the front. The inlet,
therefore, will not be much extended beyond its present limit by the
recession of the glacier. The grand rocks on either side of its channel
show ice-action in telling style. The Norris Glacier, about two miles
below the Taku is a good example of a glacier in the first stage of
decadence. The Taku River enters the head of the inlet a little to the
east of the glaciers, coming from beyond the main coast range. All the
tourists are delighted at seeing a grand glacier in the flesh. The
scenery is very fine here and in the channel at Juneau. On Douglas
Island there is a large mill of 240 stamps, all run by one small
water-wheel, which, however, is acted on by water at enormous pressure.
The forests around the mill are being rapidly nibbled away. Wind is
here said to be very violent at times, blowing away people and houses
and sweeping scud far up the mountain-side. Winter snow is seldom more
than a foot or two deep.

_June 21_. We arrived at Douglas Island at five in the afternoon and
went sight-seeing through the mill. Six hundred tons of low-grade
quartz are crushed per day. Juneau, on the mainland opposite the
Douglas Island mills, is quite a village, well supplied with stores,
churches, etc. A dance-house in which Indians are supposed to show
native dances of all sorts is perhaps the best-patronized of all the
places of amusement. A Mr. Brooks, who prints a paper here, gave us
some information on Mt. St. Elias, Mt. Wrangell, and the Cook Inlet and
Prince William Sound region. He told Russell that he would never reach
the summit of St. Elias, that it was inaccessible. He saw no glaciers
that discharged bergs into the sea at Cook Inlet, but many in Prince
William Sound.

_June 22_. Leaving Juneau at noon, we had a good view of the Auk
Glacier at the mouth of the channel between Douglas Island and the
mainland, and of Eagle Glacier a few miles north of the Auk on the east
side of Lynn Canal. Then the Davidson Glacier came in sight, finely
curved, striped with medial moraines, and girdled in front by its
magnificent tree-fringed terminal moraine; and besides these many
others of every size and pattern on the mountains bounding Lynn Canal,
most of them comparatively small, completing their sculpture. The
mountains on either hand and at the head of the canal are strikingly
beautiful at any time of the year. The sky to-day is mostly clear, with
just clouds enough hovering about the mountains to show them to best
advantage as they stretch onward in sustained grandeur like two
separate and distinct ranges, each mountain with its glaciers and
clouds and fine sculpture glowing bright in smooth, graded light. Only
a few of them exceed five thousand feet in height; but as one naturally
associates great height with ice-and-snow-laden mountains and with
glacial sculpture so pronounced, they seem much higher. There are now
two canneries at the head of Lynn Canal. The Indians furnish some of
the salmon at ten cents each. Everybody sits up to see the midnight
sky. At this time of the year there is no night here, though the sun
drops a degree or two below the horizon. One may read at twelve oâ€™clock
San Francisco time.

_June 23_. Early this morning we arrived in Glacier Bay. We passed
through crowds of bergs at the mouth of the bay, though, owing to wind
and tide, there were but few at the front of Muir Glacier. A fine,
bright day, the last of a group of a week or two, as shown by the
dryness of the sand along the shore and on the moraineâ€”rare weather
hereabouts. Most of the passengers went ashore and climbed the morame
on the east side to get a view of the glacier from a point a little
higher than the top of the front wall. A few ventured on a mile or two
farther. The day was delightful, and our one hundred and eighty
passengers were happy, gazing at the beautiful blue of the bergs and
the shattered pinnacled crystal wall, awed by the thunder and commotion
of the falling and rising ice bergs, which ever and anon sent spray
flying several hundred feet into the air and raised swells that set all
the fleet of bergs in motion and roared up the beach, telling the story
of the birth of every iceberg far and near. The number discharged
varies much, influenced in part no doubt by the tides and weather and
seasons, sometimes one every five minutes for half a day at a time on
the average, though intervals of twenty or thirty minutes may occur
without any considerable fall, then three or four immense discharges
will take place in as many minutes. The sound they make is like heavy
thunder, with a prolonged roar after deep thudding soundsâ€”a perpetual
thunderstorm easily heard three or four miles away. The roar in our
tent and the shaking of the ground one or two miles distant from points
of discharge seems startlingly near.

I had to look after camp-supplies and left the ship late this morning,
going with a crowd to the glacier; then, taking advantage of the fine
weather, I pushed off alone into the silent icy prairie to the east, to
Nunatak Island, about five hundred feet above the ice. I discovered a
small lake on the larger of the two islands, and many battered and
ground fragments of fossil wood, large and small. They seem to have
come from trees that grew on the island perhaps centuries ago. I mean
to use this island as a station in setting out stakes to measure the
glacial flow. The top of Mt. Fairweather is in sight at a distance of
perhaps thirty miles, the ice all smooth on the eastern border, wildly
broken in the central portion. I reached the ship at 2.30 P.M. I had
intended getting back at noon and sending letters and bidding friends
good-bye, but could not resist this glacier saunter. The ship moved off
as soon as I was seen on the moraine bluff, and Loomis and I waved our
hats in farewell to the many wavings of handkerchiefs of acquaintances
we had made on the trip.

Our goodsâ€”blankets, provisions, tent, etc.â€”lay in a rocky moraine
hollow within a mile of the great terminal wall of the glacier, and the
discharge of the rising and falling icebergs kept up an almost
continuous thundering and echoing, while a few gulls flew about on easy
wing or stood like specks of foam on the shore. These were our
neighbors.

After my twelve-mile walk, I ate a cracker and planned the camp. I
found that one of my boxes had been left on the steamer, but still we
have more than enough of everything. We obtained two cords of dry wood
at Juneau which Captain Carroll kindly had his men carry up the moraine
to our camp-ground. We piled the wood as a wind-break, then laid a
floor of lumber brought from Seattle for a square tent, nine feet by
nine. We set the tent, stored our provisions in it, and made our beds.
This work was done by 11.30 P.M., good daylight lasting to this time.
We slept well in our roomy cotton house, dreaming of California home
nests in the wilderness of ice.

_June 25._ A rainy day. For a few hours I kept count of the number of
bergs discharged, then sauntered along the beach to the end of the
crystal wall. A portion of the way is dangerous, the moraine bluff
being capped by an overlying lobe of the glacier, which as it melts
sends down boulders and fragments of ice, while the strip of sandy
shore at high tide is only a few rods wide, leaving but little room to
escape from the falling moraine material and the berg-waves. The view
of the ice-cliffs, pinnacles, spires and ridges was very telling, a
magnificent picture of natureâ€™s power and industry and love of beauty.
About a hundred or a hundred and fifty feet from the shore a large
stream issues from an arched, tunnel-like channel in the wall of the
glacier, the blue of the ice hall being of an exquisite tone,
contrasting with the strange, sooty, smoky, brown-colored stream. The
front wall of the Muir Glacier is about two and a half or three miles
wide. Only the central portion about two miles wide discharges
icebergs. The two wings advanced over the washed and stratified moraine
deposits have little or no motion, melting and receding as fast, or
perhaps faster, than it advances. They have been advanced at least a
mile over the old re-formed moraines, as is shown by the overlying,
angular, recent moraine deposits, now being laid down, which are
continuous with the medial moraines of the glacier.

In the old stratified moraine banks, trunks and branches of trees
showing but little sign of decay occur at a height of about a hundred
feet above tide-water. I have not yet compared this fossil wood with
that of the opposite shore deposits. That the glacier was once
withdrawn considerably back of its present limit seems plain. Immense
torrents of water had filled in the inlet with stratified
moraine-material, and for centuries favorable climatic conditions
allowed forests to grow upon it. At length the glacier advanced,
probably three or four miles, uprooting and burying the trees which had
grown undisturbed for centuries. Then came a great thaw, which produced
the flood that deposited the uprooted trees. Also the trees which grew
around the shores above reach of floods were shed off, perhaps by the
thawing of the soil that was resting on the buried margin of the
glacier, left on its retreat and protected by a covering of
moraine-material from melting as fast as the exposed surface of the
glacier. What appear to be remnants of the margin of the glacier when
it stood at a much higher level still exist on the left side and
probably all along its banks on both sides just below its present
terminus.

_June 26_. We fixed a mark on the left wing to measure the motion if
any. It rained all day, but I had a grand tramp over mud, ice, and rock
to the east wall of the inlet. Brown metamorphic slate, close-grained
in places, dips away from the inlet, presenting edges to ice-action,
which has given rise to a singularly beautiful and striking surface,
polished and grooved and fluted.

All the next day it rained. The mountains were smothered in
dull-colored mist and fog, the great glacier looming through the gloomy
gray fog fringes with wonderful effect. The thunder of bergs booms and
rumbles through the foggy atmosphere. It is bad weather for exploring
but delightful nevertheless, making all the strange, mysterious region
yet stranger and more mysterious.

_June 28_. A light rain. We were visited by two parties of Indians. A
man from each canoe came ashore, leaving the women in the canoe to
guard against the berg-waves. I tried my Chinook and made out to say
that I wanted to hire two of them in a few days to go a little way back
on the glacier and around the bay. They are seal-hunters and promised
to come again with â€œCharley,â€ who â€œhi yu kumtux wawa Bostonâ€â€”knew well
how to speak English.

I saw three huge bergs born. Spray rose about two hundred feet. Lovely
reflections showed of the pale-blue tones of the ice-wall and mountains
in the calm water. Mirages are common, making the stranded bergs along
the shore look like the sheer frontal wall of the glacier from which
they were discharged.

I am watching the ice-wall, berg life and behavior, etc. Yesterday and
to-day a solitary small flycatcher was feeding about camp. A sandpiper
on the shore, loons, ducks, gulls, and crows, a few of each, and a bald
eagle are all the birds I have noticed thus far. The glacier is
thundering gloriously.

_June 30_. Clearing clouds and sunshine. In less than a minute I saw
three large bergs born. First there is usually a preliminary thundering
of comparatively small masses as the large mass begins to fall, then
the grand crash and boom and reverberating roaring. Oftentimes three or
four heavy main throbbing thuds and booming explosions are heard as the
main mass falls in several pieces, and also secondary thuds and
thunderings as the mass or masses plunge and rise again and again ere
they come to rest. Seldom, if ever, do the towers, battlements, and
pinnacles into which the front of the glacier is broken fall forward
headlong from their bases like falling trees at the water-level or
above or below it. They mostly sink vertically or nearly so, as if
undermined by the melting action of the water of the inlet,
occasionally maintaining their upright position after sinking far below
the level of the water, and rising again a hundred feet or more into
the air with water streaming like hair down their sides from their
crowns, then launch forward and fall flat with yet another thundering
report, raising spray in magnificent, flamelike, radiating jets and
sheets, occasionally to the very top of the front wall. Illumined by
the sun, the spray and angular crystal masses are indescribably
beautiful. Some of the discharges pour in fragments from clefts in the
wall like waterfalls, white and mealy-looking, even dusty with minute
swirling ice-particles, followed by a rushing succession of
thunder-tones combining into a huge, blunt, solemn roar. Most of these
crumbling discharges are from the excessively shattered central part of
the ice-wall; the solid deep-blue masses from the ends of the wall
forming the large bergs rise from the bottom of the glacier.

Many lesser reports are heard at a distance of a mile or more from the
fall of pinnacles into crevasses or from the opening of new crevasses.
The berg discharges are very irregular, from three to twenty-two an
hour. On one rising tide, six hours, there were sixty bergs discharged,
large enough to thunder and be heard at distances of from three
quarters to one and a half miles; and on one succeeding falling tide,
six hours, sixty-nine were discharged.

_July 1_. We were awakened at four oâ€™clock this morning by the whistle
of the steamer George W. Elder. I went out on the moraine and waved my
hand in salute and was answered by a toot from the whistle. Soon a
party came ashore and asked if I was Professor Muir. The leader,
Professor Harry Fielding Reid of Cleveland, Ohio, introduced himself
and his companion, Mr. Cushing, also of Cleveland, and six or eight
young students who had come well provided with instruments to study the
glacier. They landed seven or eight tons of freight and pitched camp
beside ours. I am delighted to have companions so congenialâ€”we have now
a village.

As I set out to climb the second mountain, three thousand feet high, on
the east side of the glacier, I met many tourists returning from a walk
on the smooth east margin of the glacier, and had to answer many
questions. I had a hard climb, but wonderful views were developed and I
sketched the glacier from this high point and most of its upper
fountains.

Many fine alpine plants grew here, an anemone on the summit, two
species of cassiope in shaggy mats, three or four dwarf willows, large
blue hairy lupines eighteen inches high, parnassia, phlox, solidago,
dandelion, white-flowered bryanthus, daisy, pedicularis, epilobium,
etc., with grasses, sedges, mosses, and lichens, forming a delightful
deep spongy sod. Woodchucks stood erect and piped dolefully for an hour
â€œChee-chee!â€ with jaws absurdly stretched to emit so thin a
noteâ€”rusty-looking, seedy fellows, also a smaller striped species which
stood erect and cheeped and whistled like a Douglas squirrel. I saw
three or four species of birds. A finch flew from her nest at my feet;
and I almost stepped on a family of young ptarmigan ere they scattered,
little bunches of downy brown silk, small but able to run well. They
scattered along a snow-bank, over boulders, through willows, grass, and
flowers, while the mother, very lame, tumbled and sprawled at my feet.
I stood still until the little ones began to peep; the mother answered
â€œToo-too-tooâ€ and showed admirable judgment and devotion. She was in
brown plumage with white on the wing primaries. She had fine grounds on
which to lead and feed her young.

Not a cloud in the sky to-day; a faint film to the north vanished by
noon, leaving all the sky full of soft, hazy light. The magnificent
mountains around the widespread tributaries of the glacier; the great,
gently undulating, prairie-like expanse of the main trunk, bluish on
the east, pure white on the west and north; its trains of moraines in
magnificent curving lines and many colorsâ€”black, gray, red, and brown;
the stormy, cataract-like, crevassed sections; the hundred fountains;
the lofty, pure white Fairweather Range; the thunder of the plunging
bergs; the fleet of bergs sailing tranquilly in the inletâ€”formed a
glowing picture of natureâ€™s beauty and power.

_July 2_. I crossed the inlet with Mr. Reid and Mr. Adams to-day. The
stratified drift on the west side all the way from top to base contains
fossil wood. On the east side, as far as I have seen it, the wood
occurs only in one stratum at a height of about a hundred and twenty
feet in sand and clay. Some in a bank of the west side are rooted in
clay soil. I noticed a large grove of stumps in a washed-out channel
near the glacier-front but had no time to examine closely. Evidently a
flood carrying great quantities of sand and gravel had overwhelmed and
broken off these trees, leaving high stumps. The deposit, about a
hundred feet or more above them, had been recently washed out by one of
the draining streams of the glacier, exposing a part of the old forest
floor certainly two or three centuries old.

I climbed along the right bank of the lowest of the tributaries and set
a signal flag on a ridge fourteen hundred feet high. This tributary is
about one and a fourth or one and a half miles wide and has four
secondary tributaries. It reaches tide-water but gives off no bergs.
Later I climbed the large Nunatak Island, seven thousand feet high,
near the west margin of the glacier. It is composed of crumbling
granite draggled with washed boulders, but has some enduring bosses
which on sides and top are polished and scored rigidly, showing that it
had been heavily overswept by the glacier when it was thousands of feet
deeper than now, like a submerged boulder in a river-channel. This
island is very irregular in form, owing to the variations in the
structure joints of the granite. It has several small lakelets and has
been loaded with glacial drift, but by the melting of the ice about its
flanks is shedding it off, together with some of its own crumbling
surface. I descended a deep rock gully on the north side, the rawest,
dirtiest, dustiest, most dangerous that I have seen hereabouts. There
is also a large quantity of fossil wood scattered on this island,
especially on the north side, that on the south side having been
cleared off and carried away by the first tributary glacier, which,
being lower and melting earlier, has allowed the soil of the moraine
material to fall, together with its forest, and be carried off. That on
the north side is now being carried off or buried. The last of the main
ice foundation is melting and the moraine material re-formed over and
over again, and the fallen tree-trunks, decayed or half decayed or in a
fair state of preservation, are also unburied and buried again or
carried off to the terminal or lateral moraine.

I found three small seedling Sitka spruces, feeble beginnings of a new
forest. The circumference of the island is about seven miles. I arrived
at camp about midnight, tired and cold. Sailing across the inlet in a
cranky rotten boat through the midst of icebergs was dangerous, and I
was glad to get ashore.

_July 4_. I climbed the east wall to the summit, about thirty-one
hundred feet or so, by the northernmost ravine next to the yellow
ridge, finding about a mile of snow in the upper portion of the ravine
and patches on the summit. A few of the patches probably lie all the
year, the ground beneath them is so plantless. On the edge of some of
the snow-banks I noticed cassiope. The thin, green, mosslike patches
seen from camp are composed of a rich, shaggy growth of cassiope,
white-flowered bryanthus, dwarf vaccinium with bright pink flowers,
saxifrages, anemones, bluebells, gentians, small erigeron, pedicularis,
dwarf-willow and a few species of grasses. Of these, _Cassiope
tetragona_ is far the most influential and beautiful. Here it forms
mats a foot thick and an acre or more in area, the sections being
measured by the size and drainage of the soil-patches. I saw a few
plants anchored in the less crumbling parts of the steep-faced bosses
and stepsâ€”parnassia, potentilla, hedysarum, lutkea, etc. The lower,
rough-looking patches half way up the mountain are mostly alder bushes
ten or fifteen feet high. I had a fine view of the top of the
mountain-mass which forms the boundary wall of the upper portion of the
inlet on the west side, and of several glaciers, tributary to the first
of the eastern tributaries of the main Muir Glacier. Five or six of
these tributaries were seen, most of them now melted off from the trunk
and independent. The highest peak to the eastward has an elevation of
about five thousand feet or a little less. I also had glorious views of
the Fairweather Range, La PÃ©rouse, Crillon, Lituya, and Fairweather.
Mt. Fairweather is the most beautiful of all the giants that stand
guard about Glacier Bay. When the sun is shining on it from the east or
south its magnificent glaciers and colors are brought out in most
telling display. In the late afternoon its features become less
distinct. The atmosphere seems pale and hazy, though around to the
north and northeastward of Fairweather innumerable white peaks are
displayed, the highest fountain-heads of the Muir Glacier crowded
together in bewildering array, most exciting and inviting to the
mountaineer. Altogether I have had a delightful day, a truly glorious
celebration of the fourth.

_July 6_. I sailed three or four miles down the east coast of the inlet
with the Reid partyâ€™s cook, who is supposed to be an experienced camper
and prospector, and landed at a stratified moraine-bank. It was here
that I camped in 1880, a point at that time less than half a mile from
the front of the glacier, now one and a half miles. I found my Indianâ€™s
old camp made just ten years ago, and Professor Wrightâ€™s of five years
ago. Their alder-bough beds and fireplace were still marked and but
little decayed. I found thirty-three species of plants in flower, not
counting willowsâ€”a showy garden on the shore only a few feet above high
tide, watered by a fine stream. Lutkea, hedysarum, parnassia,
epilobium, bluebell, solidago, habenaria, strawberry with fruit half
grown, arctostaphylos, mertensia, erigeron, willows, tall grasses and
alder are the principal species. There are many butterflies in this
garden. Gulls are breeding near here. I saw young in the water to-day.

On my way back to camp I discovered a group of monumental stumps in a
washed-out valley of the moraine and went ashore to observe them. They
are in the dry course of a flood-channel about eighty feet above mean
tide and four or five hundred yards back from the shore, where they
have been pounded and battered by boulders rolling against them and
over them, making them look like gigantic shaving-brushes. The largest
is about three feet in diameter and probably three hundred years old. I
mean to return and examine them at leisure. A smaller stump, still
firmly rooted, is standing astride of an old crumbling trunk, showing
that at least two generations of trees flourished here undisturbed by
the advance or retreat of the glacier or by its draining stream-floods.
They are Sitka spruces and the wood is mostly in a good state of
preservation. How these trees were broken off without being uprooted is
dark to me at present. Perhaps most of their companions were up rooted
and carried away.

[Illustration: Ruins of Buried Forest, East Side of Muir Glacier.]

_July 7_. Another fine day; scarce a cloud in the sky. The icebergs in
the bay are miraged in the distance to look like the frontal wall of a
great glacier. I am writing letters in anticipation of the next
steamer, the Queen.

She arrived about 2.30 P.M. with two hundred and thirty tourists. What
a show they made with their ribbons and kodaks! All seemed happy and
enthusiastic, though it was curious to see how promptly all of them
ceased gazing when the dinner-bell rang, and how many turned from the
great thundering crystal world of ice to look curiously at the Indians
that came alongside to sell trinkets, and how our little camp and
kitchen arrangements excited so many to loiter and waste their precious
time prying into our poor hut.

_July 8_. A fine clear day. I went up the glacier to observe stakes and
found that a marked point near the middle of the current had flowed
about a hundred feet in eight days. On the medial moraine one mile from
the front there was no measureable displacement. I found a raven
devouring a tom-cod that was alive on a shallow at the mouth of the
creek. It had probably been wounded by a seal or eagle.

_July 10_. I have been getting acquainted with the main features of the
glacier and its fountain mountains with reference to an exploration of
its main tributaries and the upper part of its prairie-like trunk, a
trip I have long had in mind. I have been building a sled and must now
get fully ready to start without reference to the weather. Yesterday
evening I saw a large blue berg just as it was detached sliding down
from the front. Two of Professor Reidâ€™s party rowed out to it as it
sailed past the camp, estimating it to be two hundred and forty feet in
length and one hundred feet high.




Chapter XVIII
My Sled-Trip on the Muir Glacier


I started off the morning of July 11 on my memorable sled-trip to
obtain general views of the main upper part of the Muir Glacier and its
seven principal tributaries, feeling sure that I would learn something
and at the same time get rid of a severe bronchial cough that followed
an attack of the grippe and had troubled me for three months. I
intended to camp on the glacier every night, and did so, and my throat
grew better every day until it was well, for no lowland microbe could
stand such a trip. My sled was about three feet long and made as light
as possible. A sack of hardtack, a little tea and sugar, and a
sleeping-bag were firmly lashed on it so that nothing could drop off
however much it might be jarred and dangled in crossing crevasses.

Two Indians carried the baggage over the rocky moraine to the clear
glacier at the side of one of the eastern Nunatak Islands. Mr. Loomis
accompanied me to this first camp and assisted in dragging the empty
sled over the moraine. We arrived at the middle Nunatak Island about
nine oâ€™clock. Here I sent back my Indian carriers, and Mr. Loomis
assisted me the first day in hauling the loaded sled to my second camp
at the foot of Hemlock Mountain, returning the next morning.

_July 13_. I skirted the mountain to eastward a few miles and was
delighted to discover a group of trees high up on its ragged rocky
side, the first trees I had seen on the shores of Glacier Bay or on
those of any of its glaciers. I left my sled on the ice and climbed the
mountain to see what I might learn. I found that all the trees were
mountain hemlock (_Tsuga mertensiana_), and were evidently the remnant
of an old well-established forest, standing on the only ground that was
stable, all the rest of the forest below it having been sloughed off
with the soil from the disintegrating slate bed rock. The lowest of the
trees stood at an elevation of about two thousand feet above the sea,
the highest at about three thousand feet or a little higher. Nothing
could be more striking than the contrast between the raw, crumbling,
deforested portions of the mountain, looking like a quarry that was
being worked, and the forested part with its rich, shaggy beds of
cassiope and bryanthus in full bloom, and its sumptuous cushions of
flower-enameled mosses. These garden-patches are full of gay colors of
gentian, erigeron, anemone, larkspur, and columbine, and are enlivened
with happy birds and bees and marmots. Climbing to an elevation of
twenty-five hundred feet, which is about fifteen hundred feet above the
level of the glacier at this point, I saw and heard a few marmots, and
three ptarmigans that were as tame as barnyard fowls. The sod is
sloughing off on the edges, keeping it ragged. The trees are storm-bent
from the southeast. A few are standing at an elevation of nearly three
thousand feet; at twenty-five hundred feet, pyrola, veratrum,
vaccinium, fine grasses, sedges, willows, mountain-ash, buttercups, and
acres of the most luxuriant cassiope are in bloom.

A lake encumbered with icebergs lies at the end of Divide Glacier. A
spacious, level-floored valley beyond it, eight or ten miles long, with
forested mountains on its west side, perhaps discharges to the
southeastward into Lynn Canal. The divide of the glacier is about
opposite the third of the eastern tributaries. Another berg-dotted lake
into which the drainage of the Braided Glacier flows, lies a few miles
to the westward and is one and a half miles long. Berg Lake is next the
remarkable Girdled Glacier to the southeastward.

When the ice-period was in its prime, much of the Muir Glacier that now
flows northward into Howling Valley flowed southward into Glacier Bay
as a tributary of the Muir. All the rock contours show this, and so do
the medial moraines. Berg Lake is crowded with bergs because they have
no outlet and melt slowly. I heard none discharged. I had a hard time
crossing the Divide Glacier, on which I camped. Half a mile back from
the lake I gleaned a little fossil wood and made a fire on moraine
boulders for tea. I slept fairly well on the sled. I heard the roar of
four cascades on a shaggy green mountain on the west side of Howling
Valley and saw three wild goats fifteen hundred feet up in the steep
grassy pastures.

_July 14_. I rose at four oâ€™clock this cloudy and dismal morning and
looked for my goats, but saw only one. I thought there must be wolves
where there were goats, and in a few minutes heard their low, dismal,
far-reaching howling. One of them sounded very near and came nearer
until it seemed to be less than a quarter of a mile away on the edge of
the glacier. They had evidently seen me, and one or more had come down
to observe me, but I was unable to catch sight of any of them. About
half an hour later, while I was eating breakfast, they began howling
again, so near I began to fear they had a mind to attack me, and I made
haste to the shelter of a big square boulder, where, though I had no
gun, I might be able to defend myself from a front attack with my
alpenstock. After waiting half an hour or so to see what these wild
dogs meant to do, I ventured to proceed on my journey to the foot of
Snow Dome, where I camped for the night.

There are six tributaries on the northwest side of Divide arm, counting
to the Gray Glacier, next after Granite CaÃ±on Glacier going northwest.
Next is Dirt Glacier, which is dead. I saw bergs on the edge of the
main glacier a mile back from here which seem to have been left by the
draining of a pool in a sunken hollow. A circling rim of driftwood,
back twenty rods on the glacier, marks the edge of the lakelet shore
where the bergs lie scattered and stranded. It is now half past ten
oâ€™clock and getting dusk as I sit by my little fossil-wood fire writing
these notes. A strange bird is calling and complaining. A stream is
rushing into a glacier well on the edge of which I am camped, back a
few yards from the base of the mountain for fear of falling stones. A
few small ones are rattling down the steep slope. I must go to bed.

_July 15_. I climbed the dome to plan a way, scan the glacier, and take
bearings, etc., in case of storms. The main divide is about fifteen
hundred feet; the second divide, about fifteen hundred also, is about
one and one half miles southeastward. The flow of water on the glacier
noticeably diminished last night though there was no frost. It is now
already increasing. Stones begin to roll into the crevasses and into
new positions, sliding against each other, half turning over or falling
on moraine ridges. Mud pellets with small pebbles slip and roll slowly
from ice-hummocks again and again. How often and by how many ways are
boulders finished and finally brought to anything like permanent form
and place in beds for farms and fields, forests and gardens. Into
crevasses and out again, into moraines, shifted and reinforced and
reformed by avalanches, melting from pedestals, etc. Rain, frost, and
dew help in the work; they are swept in rills, caught and ground in
pot-hole mills. Moraines of washed pebbles, like those on glacier
margins, are formed by snow avalanches deposited in crevasses, then
weathered out and projected on the ice as shallow raised moraines.
There is one such at this camp.

A ptarmigan is on a rock twenty yards distant, as if on show. It has
red over the eye, a white line, not conspicuous, over the red, belly
white, white markings over the upper parts on ground of brown and black
wings, mostly white as seen when flying, but the coverts the same as
the rest of the body. Only about three inches of the folded primaries
show white. The breast seems to have golden iridescent colors, white
under the wings. It allowed me to approach within twenty feet. It
walked down a sixty degree slope of the rock, took flight with a few
whirring wing-beats, then sailed with wings perfectly motionless four
hundred yards down a gentle grade, and vanished over the brow of a
cliff. Ten days ago Loomis told me that he found a nest with nine eggs.
On the way down to my sled I saw four more ptarmigans. They utter harsh
notes when alarmed. â€œCrack, chuck, crack,â€ with the _r_ rolled and
prolonged. I also saw fresh and old goat-tracks and some bones that
suggest wolves.

There is a pass through the mountains at the head of the third glacier.
Fine mountains stand at the head on each side. The one on the northeast
side is the higher and finer every way. It has three glaciers,
tributary to the third. The third glacier has altogether ten
tributaries, five on each side. The mountain on the left side of White
Glacier is about six thousand feet high. The moraines of Girdled
Glacier seem scarce to run anywhere. Only a little material is carried
to Berg Lake. Most of it seems to be at rest as a terminal on the main
glacier-field, which here has little motion. The curves of these last
as seen from this mountain-top are very beautiful.

It has been a glorious day, all pure sunshine. An hour or more before
sunset the distant mountains, a vast host, seemed more softly ethereal
than ever, pale blue, ineffably fine, all angles and harshness melted
off in the soft evening light. Even the snow and the grinding,
cascading glaciers became divinely tender and fine in this celestial
amethystine light. I got back to camp at 7.15, not tired. After my
hardtack supper I could have climbed the mountain again and got back
before sunrise, but dragging the sled tires me. I have been out on the
glacier examining a moraine-like mass about a third of a mile from
camp. It is perhaps a mile long, a hundred yards wide, and is thickly
strewn with wood. I think that it has been brought down the mountain by
a heavy snow avalanche, loaded on the ice, then carried away from the
shore in the direction of the flow of the glacier. This explains
detached moraine-masses. This one seems to have been derived from a big
roomy cirque or amphitheatre on the northwest side of this Snow Dome
Mountain.

To shorten the return journey I was tempted to glissade down what
appeared to be a snow-filled ravine, which was very steep. All went
well until I reached a bluish spot which proved to be ice, on which I
lost control of myself and rolled into a gravel talus at the foot
without a scratch. Just as I got up and was getting myself orientated,
I heard a loud fierce scream, uttered in an exulting, diabolical tone
of voice which startled me, as if an enemy, having seen me fall, was
glorying in my death. Then suddenly two ravens came swooping from the
sky and alighted on the jag of a rock within a few feet of me,
evidently hoping that I had been maimed and that they were going to
have a feast. But as they stared at me, studying my condition,
impatiently waiting for bone-picking time, I saw what they were up to
and shouted, â€œNot yet, not yet!â€

_July 16_. At 7 A.M. I left camp to cross the main glacier. Six ravens
came to the camp as soon as I left. What wonderful eyes they must have!
Nothing that moves in all this icy wilderness escapes the eyes of these
brave birds. This is one of the loveliest mornings I ever saw in
Alaska; not a cloud or faintest hint of one in all the wide sky. There
is a yellowish haze in the east, white in the west, mild and mellow as
a Wisconsin Indian Summer, but finer, more ethereal, Godâ€™s holy light
making all divine.

In an hour or so I came to the confluence of the first of the seven
grand tributaries of the main Muir Glacier and had a glorious view of
it as it comes sweeping down in wild cascades from its magnificent,
pure white, mountain-girt basin to join the main crystal sea, its many
fountain peaks, clustered and crowded, all pouring forth their tribute
to swell its grand current. I crossed its front a little below its
confluence, where its shattered current, about two or three miles wide,
is reunited, and many rills and good-sized brooks glide gurgling and
ringing in pure blue channels, giving delightful animation to the icy
solitude.

Most of the ice-surface crossed to-day has been very uneven, and
hauling the sled and finding a way over hummocks has been fatiguing. At
times I had to lift the sled bodily and to cross many narrow,
nerve-trying, ice-sliver bridges, balancing astride of them, and
cautiously shoving the sled ahead of me with tremendous chasms on
either side. I had made perhaps not more than six or eight miles in a
straight line by six oâ€™clock this evening when I reached ice so
hummocky and tedious I concluded to camp and not try to take the sled
any farther. I intend to leave it here in the middle of the basin and
carry my sleeping-bag and provisions the rest of the way across to the
west side. I am cozy and comfortable here resting in the midst of
glorious icy scenery, though very tired. I made out to get a cup of tea
by means of a few shavings and splinters whittled from the bottom board
of my sled, and made a fire in a little can, a small campfire, the
smallest I ever made or saw, yet it answered well enough as far as tea
was concerned. I crept into my sack before eight oâ€™clock as the wind
was cold and my feet wet. One of my shoes is about worn out. I may have
to put on a wooden sole. This day has been cloudless throughout, with
lovely sunshine, a purple evening and morning. The circumference of
mountains beheld from the midst of this world of ice is marvelous, the
vast plain reposing in such soft tender light, the fountain mountains
so clearly cut, holding themselves aloft with their loads of ice in
supreme strength and beauty of architecture. I found a skull and most
of the other bones of a goat on the glacier about two miles from the
nearest land. It had probably been chased out of its mountain home by
wolves and devoured here. I carried its horns with me. I saw many
considerable depressions in the glacial surface, also a pitlike hole,
irregular, not like the ordinary wells along the slope of the many
small dirt-clad hillocks, faced to the south. Now the sun is down and
the sky is saffron yellow, blending and fading into purple around to
the south and north. It is a curious experience to be lying in bed
writing these notes, hummock waves rising in every direction, their
edges marking a multitude of crevasses and pits, while all around the
horizon rise peaks innumerable of most intricate style of architecture.
Solemnly growling and grinding moulins contrast with the sweet
low-voiced whispering and warbling of a network of rills, singing like
water-ouzels, glinting, gliding with indescribable softness and
sweetness of voice. They are all around, one within a few feet of my
hard sled bed.

_July 17_. Another glorious cloudless day is dawning in yellow and
purple and soon the sun over the eastern peak will blot out the blue
peak shadows and make all the vast white ice prairie sparkle. I slept
well last night in the middle of the icy sea. The wind was cold but my
sleeping-bag enabled me to lie neither warm nor intolerably cold. My
three-months cough is gone. Strange that with such work and exposure
one should know nothing of sore throats and of what are called colds.
My heavy, thick-soled shoes, resoled just before starting on the trip
six days ago, are about worn out and my feet have been wet every night.
But no harm comes of it, nothing but good. I succeeded in getting a
warm breakfast in bed. I reached over the edge of my sled, got hold of
a small cedar stick that I had been carrying, whittled a lot of thin
shavings from it, stored them on my breast, then set fire to a piece of
paper in a shallow tin can, added a pinch of shavings, held the cup of
water that always stood at my bedside over the tiny blaze with one
hand, and fed the fire by adding little pinches of shavings until the
water boiled, then pulling my bread sack within reach, made a good warm
breakfast, cooked and eaten in bed. Thus refreshed, I surveyed the
wilderness of crevassed, hummocky ice and concluded to try to drag my
little sled a mile or two farther, then, finding encouragement,
persevered, getting it across innumerable crevasses and streams and
around several lakes and over and through the midst of hummocks, and at
length reached the western shore between five and six oâ€™clock this
evening, extremely fatigued. This I consider a hard job well done,
crossing so wildly broken a glacier, fifteen miles of it from Snow Dome
Mountain, in two days with a sled weighing altogether not less than a
hundred pounds. I found innumerable crevasses, some of them brimful of
water. I crossed in most places just where the ice was close pressed
and welded after descending cascades and was being shoved over an
upward slope, thus closing the crevasses at the bottom, leaving only
the upper sun-melted beveled portion open for water to collect in.

Vast must be the drainage from this great basin. The waste in sunshine
must be enormous, while in dark weather rains and winds also melt the
ice and add to the volume produced by the rain itself. The winds also,
though in temperature they may be only a degree or two above
freezing-point, dissolve the ice as fast, or perhaps faster, than clear
sunshine. Much of the water caught in tight crevasses doubtless freezes
during the winter and gives rise to many of the irregular veins seen in
the structure of the glacier. Saturated snow also freezes at times and
is incorporated with the ice, as only from the lower part of the
glacier is the snow melted during the summer. I have noticed many
traces of this action. One of the most beautiful things to be seen on
the glacier is the myriads of minute and intensely brilliant radiant
lights burning in rows on the banks of streams and pools and lakelets
from the tips of crystals melting in the sun, making them look as if
bordered with diamonds. These gems are rayed like stars and twinkle; no
diamond radiates keener or more brilliant light. It was perfectly
glorious to think of this divine light burning over all this vast
crystal sea in such ineffably fine effulgence, and over how many other
of icy Alaskaâ€™s glaciers where nobody sees it. To produce these effects
I fancy the ice must be melting rapidly, as it was being melted to-day.
The ice in these pools does not melt with anything like an even
surface, but in long branches and leaves, making fairy forests of
points, while minute bubbles of air are constantly being set free. I am
camped to-night on what I call Quarry Mountain from its raw, loose,
plantless condition, seven or eight miles above the front of the
glacier. I found enough fossil wood for tea. Glorious is the view to
the eastward from this camp. The sun has set, a few clouds appear, and
a torrent rushing down a gully and under the edge of the glacier is
making a solemn roaring. No tinkling, whistling rills this night. Ever
and anon I hear a falling boulder. I have had a glorious and
instructive day, but am excessively weary and to bed I go.

_July 18_. I felt tired this morning and meant to rest to-day. But
after breakfast at 8 A.M. I felt I must be up and doing, climbing,
sketching new views up the great tributaries from the top of Quarry
Mountain. Weariness vanished and I could have climbed, I think, five
thousand feet. Anything seems easy after sled-dragging over hummocks
and crevasses, and the constant nerve-strain in jumping crevasses so as
not to slip in making the spring. Quarry Mountain is the barest I have
seen, a raw quarry with infinite abundance of loose decaying granite
all on the go. Its slopes are excessively steep. A few patches of
epilobium make gay purple spots of color. Its seeds fly everywhere
seeking homes. Quarry Mountain is cut across into a series of parallel
ridges by oversweeping ice. It is still overswept in three places by
glacial flows a half to three quarters of a mile wide, finely arched at
the top of the divides. I have been sketching, though my eyes are much
inflamed and I can scarce see. All the lines I make appear double. I
fear I shall not be able to make the few more sketches I want
to-morrow, but must try. The day has been gloriously sunful, the
glacier pale yellow toward five oâ€™clock. The hazy air, white with a
yellow tinge, gives an Indian-summerish effect. Now the blue evening
shadows are creeping out over the icy plain, some ten miles long, with
sunny yellow belts between them. Boulders fall now and again with dull,
blunt booming, and the gravel pebbles rattle.

_July 19_. Nearly blind. The light is intolerable and I fear I may be
long unfitted for work. I have been lying on my back all day with a
snow poultice bound over my eyes. Every object I try to look at seems
double; even the distant mountain-ranges are doubled, the upper an
exact copy of the lower, though somewhat faint. This is the first time
in Alaska that I have had too much sunshine. About four oâ€™clock this
afternoon, when I was waiting for the evening shadows to enable me to
get nearer the main camp, where I could be more easily found in case my
eyes should become still more inflamed and I should be unable to
travel, thin clouds cast a grateful shade over all the glowing
landscape. I gladly took advantage of these kindly clouds to make an
effort to cross the few miles of the glacier that lay between me and
the shore of the inlet. I made a pair of goggles but am afraid to wear
them. Fortunately the ice here is but little broken, therefore I pulled
my cap well down and set off about five oâ€™clock. I got on pretty well
and camped on the glacier in sight of the main camp, which from here in
a straight line is only five or six miles away. I went ashore on
Granite Island and gleaned a little fossil wood with which I made tea
on the ice.

_July 20_. I kept wet bandages on my eyes last night as long as I
could, and feel better this morning, but all the mountains still seem
to have double summits, giving a curiously unreal aspect to the
landscape. I packed everything on the sled and moved three miles
farther down the glacier, where I want to make measurements. Twice
to-day I was visited on the ice by a hummingbird, attracted by the red
lining of the bear-skin sleeping-bag.

I have gained some light on the formation of gravel-beds along the
inlet. The material is mostly sifted and sorted by successive railings
and washings along the margins of the glacier-tributaries, where the
supply is abundant beyond anything I ever saw elsewhere. The lowering
of the surface of a glacier when its walls are not too steep leaves a
part of the margin dead and buried and protected from the wasting
sunshine beneath the lateral moraines. Thus a marginal valley is
formed, clear ice on one side, or nearly so, buried ice on the other.
As melting goes on, the marginal trough, or valley, grows deeper and
wider, since both sides are being melted, the land side slower. The
dead, protected ice in melting first sheds off the large boulders, as
they are not able to lie on slopes where smaller ones can. Then the
next larger ones are rolled off, and pebbles and sand in succession.
Meanwhile this material is subjected to torrent-action, as if it were
cast into a trough. When floods come it is carried forward and
stratified, according to the force of the current, sand, mud, or larger
material. This exposes fresh surfaces of ice and melting goes on again,
until enough material has been undermined to form a veil in front; then
follows another washing and carrying-away and depositing where the
current is allowed to spread. In melting, protected margin terraces are
oftentimes formed. Perhaps these terraces mark successive heights of
the glacial surface. From terrace to terrace the grist of stone is
rolled and sifted. Some, meeting only feeble streams, have only the
fine particles carried away and deposited in smooth beds; others,
coarser, from swifter streams, overspread the fine beds, while many of
the large boulders no doubt roll back upon the glacier to go on their
travels again.

It has been cloudy mostly to-day, though sunny in the afternoon, and my
eyes are getting better. The steamer Queen is expected in a day or two,
so I must try to get down to the inlet to-morrow and make signal to
have some of the Reid party ferry me over. I must hear from home, write
letters, get rest and more to eat.

Near the front of the glacier the ice was perfectly free, apparently,
of anything like a crevasse, and in walking almost carelessly down it I
stopped opposite the large granite Nunatak Island, thinking that I
would there be partly sheltered from the wind. I had not gone a dozen
steps toward the island when I suddenly dropped into a concealed
water-filled crevasse, which on the surface showed not the slightest
sign of its existence. This crevasse like many others was being used as
the channel of a stream, and at some narrow point the small cubical
masses of ice into which the glacier surface disintegrates were jammed
and extended back farther and farther till they completely covered and
concealed the water. Into this I suddenly plunged, after crossing
thousands of really dangerous crevasses, but never before had I
encountered a danger so completely concealed. Down I plunged over head
and ears, but of course bobbed up again, and after a hard struggle
succeeded in dragging myself out over the farther side. Then I pulled
my sled over close to Nunatak cliff, made haste to strip off my
clothing, threw it in a sloppy heap and crept into my sleeping-bag to
shiver away the night as best I could.

_July 21_. Dressing this rainy morning was a miserable job, but might
have been worse. After wringing my sloppy underclothing, getting it on
was far from pleasant. My eyes are better and I feel no bad effect from
my icy bath. The last trace of my three monthsâ€™ cough is gone. No
lowland grippe microbe could survive such experiences.

I have had a fine telling day examining the ruins of the old forest of
Sitka spruce that no great time ago grew in a shallow mud-filled basin
near the southwest corner of the glacier. The trees were protected by a
spur of the mountain that puts out here, and when the glacier advanced
they were simply flooded with fine sand and overborne. Stumps by the
hundred, three to fifteen feet high, rooted in a stream of fine blue
mud on cobbles, still have their bark on. A stratum of decomposed bark,
leaves, cones, and old trunks is still in place. Some of the stumps are
on rocky ridges of gravelly soil about one hundred and twenty-five feet
above the sea. The valley has been washed out by the stream now
occupying it, one of the glacierâ€™s draining streams a mile long or more
and an eighth of a mile wide.

I got supper early and was just going to bed, when I was startled by
seeing a man coming across the moraine, Professor Reid, who had seen me
from the main camp and who came with Mr. Loomis and the cook in their
boat to ferry me over. I had not intended making signals for them until
to-morrow but was glad to go. I had been seen also by Mr. Case and one
of his companions, who were on the western mountain-side above the
fossil forest, shooting ptarmigans. I had a good rest and sleep and
leisure to find out how rich I was in new facts and pictures and how
tired and hungry I was.




Chapter XIX
Auroras


A few days later I set out with Professor Reidâ€™s party to visit some of
the other large glaciers that flow into the bay, to observe what
changes have taken place in them since October, 1879, when I first
visited and sketched them. We found the upper half of the bay closely
choked with bergs, through which it was exceedingly difficult to force
a way. After slowly struggling a few miles up the east side, we dragged
the whale-boat and canoe over rough rocks into a fine garden and
comfortably camped for the night.

[Illustration: Floating Iceberg, Taku Inlet.]

The next day was spent in cautiously picking a way across to the west
side of the bay; and as the strangely scanty stock of provisions was
already about done, and the ice-jam to the northward seemed
impenetrable, the party decided to return to the main camp by a
comparatively open, roundabout way to the southward, while with the
canoe and a handful of food-scraps I pushed on northward. After a hard,
anxious struggle, I reached the mouth of the Hugh Miller fiord about
sundown, and tried to find a camp-spot on its steep, boulder-bound
shore. But no landing-place where it seemed possible to drag the canoe
above high-tide mark was discovered after examining a mile or more of
this dreary, forbidding barrier, and as night was closing down, I
decided to try to grope my way across the mouth of the fiord in the
starlight to an open sandy spot on which I had camped in October, 1879,
a distance of about three or four miles.

With the utmost caution I picked my way through the sparkling bergs,
and after an hour or two of this nerve-trying work, when I was perhaps
less than halfway across and dreading the loss of the frail canoe which
would include the loss of myself, I came to a pack of very large bergs
which loomed threateningly, offering no visible thoroughfare. Paddling
and pushing to right and left, I at last discovered a sheer-walled
opening about four feet wide and perhaps two hundred feet long, formed
apparently by the splitting of a huge iceberg. I hesitated to enter
this passage, fearing that the slightest change in the tide-current
might close it, but ventured nevertheless, judging that the dangers
ahead might not be greater than those I had already passed. When I had
got about a third of the way in, I suddenly discovered that the
smooth-walled ice-lane was growing narrower, and with desperate haste
backed out. Just as the bow of the canoe cleared the sheer walls they
came together with a growling crunch. Terror-stricken, I turned back,
and in an anxious hour or two gladly reached the rock-bound shore that
had at first repelled me, determined to stay on guard all night in the
canoe or find some place where with the strength that comes in a fight
for life I could drag it up the boulder wall beyond ice danger. This at
last was happily done about midnight, and with no thought of sleep I
went to bed rejoicing.

My bed was two boulders, and as I lay wedged and bent on their
up-bulging sides, beguiling the hard, cold time in gazing into the
starry sky and across the sparkling bay, magnificent upright bars of
light in bright prismatic colors suddenly appeared, marching swiftly in
close succession along the northern horizon from west to east as if in
diligent haste, an auroral display very different from any I had ever
before beheld. Once long ago in Wisconsin I saw the heavens draped in
rich purple auroral clouds fringed and folded in most magnificent
forms; but in this glory of light, so pure, so bright, so enthusiastic
in motion, there was nothing in the least cloud-like. The short
color-bars, apparently about two degrees in height, though blending,
seemed to be as well defined as those of the solar spectrum.

How long these glad, eager soldiers of light held on their way I cannot
tell; for sense of time was charmed out of mind and the blessed night
circled away in measureless rejoicing enthusiasm.

In the early morning after so inspiring a night I launched my canoe
feeling able for anything, crossed the mouth of the Hugh Miller fiord,
and forced a way three or four miles along the shore of the bay, hoping
to reach the Grand Pacific Glacier in front of Mt. Fairweather. But the
farther I went, the ice-pack, instead of showing inviting little open
streaks here and there, became so much harder jammed that on some parts
of the shore the bergs, drifting south with the tide, were shoving one
another out of the water beyond high-tide line. Farther progress to
northward was thus rigidly stopped, and now I had to fight for a way
back to my cabin, hoping that by good tide luck I might reach it before
dark. But at sundown I was less than half-way home, and though very
hungry was glad to land on a little rock island with a smooth beach for
the canoe and a thicket of alder bushes for fire and bed and a little
sleep. But shortly after sundown, while these arrangements were being
made, lo and behold another aurora enriching the heavens! and though it
proved to be one of the ordinary almost colorless kind, thrusting long,
quivering lances toward the zenith from a dark cloudlike base, after
last nightâ€™s wonderful display oneâ€™s expectations might well be
extravagant and I lay wide awake watching.

On the third night I reached my cabin and food. Professor Reid and his
party came in to talk over the results of our excursions, and just as
the last one of the visitors opened the door after bidding good-night,
he shouted, â€œMuir, come look here. Hereâ€™s something fine.â€

I ran out in auroral excitement, and sure enough here was another
aurora, as novel and wonderful as the marching rainbow-colored
columnsâ€”a glowing silver bow spanning the Muir Inlet in a magnificent
arch right under the zenith, or a little to the south of it, the ends
resting on the top of the mountain-walls. And though colorless and
steadfast, its intense, solid, white splendor, noble proportions, and
fineness of finish excited boundless admiration. In form and proportion
it was like a rainbow, a bridge of one span five miles wide; and so
brilliant, so fine and solid and homogeneous in every part, I fancy
that if all the stars were raked together into one windrow, fused and
welded and run through some celestial rolling-mill, all would be
required to make this one glowing white colossal bridge.

After my last visitor went to bed, I lay down on the moraine in front
of the cabin and gazed and watched. Hour after hour the wonderful arch
stood perfectly motionless, sharply defined and substantial-looking as
if it were a permanent addition to the furniture of the sky. At length
while it yet spanned the inlet in serene unchanging splendor, a band of
fluffy, pale gray, quivering ringlets came suddenly all in a row over
the eastern mountain-top, glided in nervous haste up and down the under
side of the bow and over the western mountain-wall. They were about one
and a half times the apparent diameter of the bow in length, maintained
a vertical posture all the way across, and slipped swiftly along as if
they were suspended like a curtain on rings. Had these lively auroral
fairies marched across the fiord on the top of the bow instead of
shuffling along the under side of it, one might have fancied they were
a happy band of spirit people on a journey making use of the splendid
bow for a bridge. There must have been hundreds of miles of them; for
the time required for each to cross from one end of the bridge to the
other seemed only a minute or less, while nearly an hour elapsed from
their first appearance until the last of the rushing throng vanished
behind the western mountain, leaving the bridge as bright and solid and
steadfast as before they arrived. But later, half an hour or so, it
began to fade. Fissures or cracks crossed it diagonally through which a
few stars were seen, and gradually it became thin and nebulous until it
looked like the Milky Way, and at last vanished, leaving no visible
monument of any sort to mark its place.

I now returned to my cabin, replenished the fire, warmed myself, and
prepared to go to bed, though too aurorally rich and happy to go to
sleep. But just as I was about to retire, I thought I had better take
another look at the sky, to make sure that the glorious show was over;
and, contrary to all reasonable expectations, I found that the pale
foundation for another bow was being laid right overhead like the
first. Then losing all thought of sleep, I ran back to my cabin,
carried out blankets and lay down on the moraine to keep watch until
daybreak, that none of the sky wonders of the glorious night within
reach of my eyes might be lost.

I had seen the first bow when it stood complete in full splendor, and
its gradual fading decay. Now I was to see the building of a new one
from the beginning. Perhaps in less than half an hour the silvery
material was gathered, condensed, and welded into a glowing, evenly
proportioned arc like the first and in the same part of the sky. Then
in due time over the eastern mountain-wall came another throng of
restless electric auroral fairies, the infinitely fine pale-gray
garments of each lightly touching those of their neighbors as they
swept swiftly along the under side of the bridge and down over the
western mountain like the merry band that had gone the same way before
them, all keeping quivery step and time to music too fine for mortal
ears.

While the gay throng was gliding swiftly along, I watched the bridge
for any change they might make upon it, but not the slightest could I
detect. They left no visible track, and after all had passed the
glowing arc stood firm and apparently immutable, but at last faded
slowly away like its glorious predecessor.

Excepting only the vast purple aurora mentioned above, said to have
been visible over nearly all the continent, these two silver bows in
supreme, serene, supernal beauty surpassed everything auroral I ever
beheld.

The Land God Forgot



     The lonely sunsets flare forlorn
      Down valleys dreadly desolate;
     The lordly mountains soar in scorn
      As still as death, as stern as fate.

          _The lonely sunsets flame and die;
           The giant valleys gulp the night;
          The monster mountains scrape the sky,
           Where eager stars are diamond-bright._

     So gaunt against the gibbous moon,
      Piercing the silence velvet-piled,
     A lone wolf howls his ancient rune --
      The fell arch-spirit of the Wild.

          _O outcast land!  O leper land!
           Let the lone wolf-cry all express
          The hate insensate of thy hand,
           Thy heart's abysmal loneliness._

The Spell of the Yukon



   I wanted the gold, and I sought it,
    I scrabbled and mucked like a slave.
   Was it famine or scurvy -- I fought it;
    I hurled my youth into a grave.
   I wanted the gold, and I got it --
    Came out with a fortune last fall, --
   Yet somehow life's not what I thought it,
    And somehow the gold isn't all.

   No!  There's the land.  (Have you seen it?)
    It's the cussedest land that I know,
   From the big, dizzy mountains that screen it
    To the deep, deathlike valleys below.
   Some say God was tired when He made it;
    Some say it's a fine land to shun;
   Maybe; but there's some as would trade it
    For no land on earth -- and I'm one.

   You come to get rich (damned good reason);
    You feel like an exile at first;
   You hate it like hell for a season,
    And then you are worse than the worst.
   It grips you like some kinds of sinning;
    It twists you from foe to a friend;
   It seems it's been since the beginning;
    It seems it will be to the end.

   I've stood in some mighty-mouthed hollow
    That's plumb-full of hush to the brim;
   I've watched the big, husky sun wallow
    In crimson and gold, and grow dim,
   Till the moon set the pearly peaks gleaming,
    And the stars tumbled out, neck and crop;
   And I've thought that I surely was dreaming,
    With the peace o' the world piled on top.

   The summer -- no sweeter was ever;
    The sunshiny woods all athrill;
   The grayling aleap in the river,
    The bighorn asleep on the hill.
   The strong life that never knows harness;
    The wilds where the caribou call;
   The freshness, the freedom, the farness --
    O God! how I'm stuck on it all.

   The winter! the brightness that blinds you,
    The white land locked tight as a drum,
   The cold fear that follows and finds you,
    The silence that bludgeons you dumb.
   The snows that are older than history,
    The woods where the weird shadows slant;
   The stillness, the  moonlight, the mystery,
    I've bade 'em good-by -- but I can't.

   There's a land where the mountains are nameless,
    And the rivers all run God knows where;
   There are lives that are erring and aimless,
    And deaths that just hang by a hair;
   There are hardships that nobody reckons;
    There are valleys unpeopled and still;
   There's a land -- oh, it beckons and beckons,
    And I want to go back -- and I will.

   They're making my money diminish;
    I'm sick of the taste of champagne.
   Thank God! when I'm skinned to a finish
    I'll pike to the Yukon again.
   I'll fight -- and you bet it's no sham-fight;
    It's hell! -- but I've been there before;
   And it's better than this by a damsite --
    So me for the Yukon once more.

   There's gold, and it's haunting and haunting;
    It's luring me on as of old;
   Yet it isn't the gold that I'm wanting
    So much as just finding the gold.
   It's the great, big, broad land 'way up yonder,
    It's the forests where silence has lease;
   It's the beauty that thrills me with wonder,
    It's the stillness that fills me with peace.




The Heart of the Sourdough



   There where the mighty mountains bare their fangs unto the moon,
   There where the sullen sun-dogs glare in the snow-bright, bitter noon,
   And the glacier-glutted streams sweep down at the clarion call of June.

   There where the livid tundras keep their tryst with the tranquil snows;
   There where the silences are spawned, and the light of hell-fire flows
   Into the bowl of the midnight sky, violet, amber and rose.

   There where the rapids churn and roar, and the ice-floes bellowing run;
   Where the tortured, twisted rivers of blood rush to the setting sun --
   I've packed my kit and I'm going, boys, ere another day is done.

        *    *    *    *    *

   I knew it would call, or soon or late, as it calls the whirring wings;
   It's the olden lure, it's the golden lure,
     it's the lure of the timeless things,
   And to-night, oh, God of the trails untrod,
     how it whines in my heart-strings!

   I'm sick to death of your well-groomed gods, your make believe and your show;
   I long for a whiff of bacon and beans, a snug shakedown in the snow;
   A trail to break, and a life at stake, and another bout with the foe.

   With the raw-ribbed Wild that abhors all life,
     the Wild that would crush and rend,
   I have clinched and closed with the naked North,
     I have learned to defy and defend;
   Shoulder to shoulder we have fought it out --
     yet the Wild must win in the end.

   I have flouted the Wild.  I have followed its lure,
     fearless, familiar, alone;
   By all that the battle means and makes I claim that land for mine own;
   Yet the Wild must win, and a day will come when I shall be overthrown.

   Then when as wolf-dogs fight we've fought, the lean wolf-land and I;
   Fought and bled till the snows are red under the reeling sky;
   Even as lean wolf-dog goes down will I go down and die.




The Three Voices



   The waves have a story to tell me,
    As I lie on the lonely beach;
   Chanting aloft in the pine-tops,
    The wind has a lesson to teach;
   But the stars sing an anthem of glory
    I cannot put into speech.

   The waves tell of ocean spaces,
    Of hearts that are wild and brave,
   Of populous city places,
    Of desolate shores they lave,
   Of men who sally in quest of gold
    To sink in an ocean grave.

   The wind is a mighty roamer;
    He bids me keep me free,
   Clean from the taint of the gold-lust,
    Hardy and pure as he;
   Cling with my love to nature,
    As a child to the mother-knee.

   But the stars throng out in their glory,
    And they sing of the God in man;
   They sing of the Mighty Master,
    Of the loom his fingers span,
   Where a star or a soul is a part of the whole,
    And weft in the wondrous plan.

   Here by the camp-fire's flicker,
    Deep in my blanket curled,
   I long for the peace of the pine-gloom,
    When the scroll of the Lord is unfurled,
   And the wind and the wave are silent,
    And world is singing to world.




The Law of the Yukon



   This is the law of the Yukon, and ever she makes it plain:
   "Send not your foolish and feeble; send me your strong and your sane --
   Strong for the red rage of battle; sane for I harry them sore;
   Send me men girt for the combat, men who are grit to the core;
   Swift as the panther in triumph, fierce as the bear in defeat,
   Sired of a bulldog parent, steeled in the furnace heat.
   Send me the best of your breeding, lend me your chosen ones;
   Them will I take to my bosom, them will I call my sons;
   Them will I gild with my treasure, them will I glut with my meat;
   But the others -- the misfits, the failures -- I trample under my feet.
   Dissolute, damned and despairful, crippled and palsied and slain,
   Ye would send me the spawn of your gutters -- Go! take back your spawn again.

   "Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway;
   From my ruthless throne I have ruled alone for a million years and a day;
   Hugging my mighty treasure, waiting for man to come,
   Till he swept like a turbid torrent, and after him swept -- the scum.
   The pallid pimp of the dead-line, the enervate of the pen,
   One by one I weeded them out, for all that I sought was -- Men.
   One by one I dismayed them, frighting them sore with my glooms;
   One by one I betrayed them unto my manifold dooms.
   Drowned them like rats in my rivers, starved them like curs on my plains,
   Rotted the flesh that was left them, poisoned the blood in their veins;
   Burst with my winter upon them, searing forever their sight,
   Lashed them with fungus-white faces, whimpering wild in the night;

   "Staggering blind through the storm-whirl, stumbling mad through the snow,
   Frozen stiff in the ice-pack, brittle and bent like a bow;
   Featureless, formless, forsaken, scented by wolves in their flight,
   Left for the wind to make music through ribs that are glittering white;
   Gnawing the black crust of failure, searching the pit of despair,
   Crooking the toe in the trigger, trying to patter a prayer;
   Going outside with an escort, raving with lips all afoam,
   Writing a cheque for a million, driveling feebly of home;
   Lost like a louse in the burning... or else in the tented town
   Seeking a drunkard's solace, sinking and sinking down;
   Steeped in the slime at the bottom, dead to a decent world,
   Lost 'mid the human flotsam, far on the frontier hurled;
   In the camp at the bend of the river, with its dozen saloons aglare,
   Its gambling dens ariot, its gramophones all ablare;
   Crimped with the crimes of a city, sin-ridden and bridled with lies,
   In the hush of my mountained vastness, in the flush of my midnight skies.
   Plague-spots, yet tools of my purpose, so natheless I suffer them thrive,
   Crushing my Weak in their clutches, that only my Strong may survive.

   "But the others, the men of my mettle, the men who would 'stablish my fame
   Unto its ultimate issue, winning me honor, not shame;
   Searching my uttermost valleys, fighting each step as they go,
   Shooting the wrath of my rapids, scaling my ramparts of snow;
   Ripping the guts of my mountains, looting the beds of my creeks,
   Them will I take to my bosom, and speak as a mother speaks.
   I am the land that listens, I am the land that broods;
   Steeped in eternal beauty, crystalline waters and woods.
   Long have I waited lonely, shunned as a thing accurst,
   Monstrous, moody, pathetic, the last of the lands and the first;
   Visioning camp-fires at twilight, sad with a longing forlorn,
   Feeling my womb o'er-pregnant with the seed of cities unborn.
   Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway,
   And I wait for the men who will win me -- and I will not be won in a day;
   And I will not be won by weaklings, subtle, suave and mild,
   But by men with the hearts of vikings, and the simple faith of a child;
   Desperate, strong and resistless, unthrottled by fear or defeat,
   Them will I gild with my treasure, them will I glut with my meat.

   "Lofty I stand from each sister land, patient and wearily wise,
   With the weight of a world of sadness in my quiet, passionless eyes;
   Dreaming alone of a people, dreaming alone of a day,
   When men shall not rape my riches, and curse me and go away;
   Making a bawd of my bounty, fouling the hand that gave --
   Till I rise in my wrath and I sweep on their path
     and I stamp them into a grave.
   Dreaming of men who will bless me, of women esteeming me good,
   Of children born in my borders of radiant motherhood,
   Of cities leaping to stature, of fame like a flag unfurled,
   As I pour the tide of my riches in the eager lap of the world."

   This is the Law of the Yukon, that only the Strong shall thrive;
   That surely the Weak shall perish, and only the Fit survive.
   Dissolute, damned and despairful, crippled and palsied and slain,
   This is the Will of the Yukon, -- Lo, how she makes it plain!




The Parson's Son



        _This is the song of the parson's son, as he squats in his shack alone,
        On the wild, weird nights, when the Northern Lights
          shoot up from the frozen zone,
        And it's sixty below, and couched in the snow the hungry huskies moan:_

   "I'm one of the Arctic brotherhood, I'm an old-time pioneer.
   I came with the first -- O God! how I've cursed
     this Yukon -- but still I'm here.
   I've sweated athirst in its summer heat, I've frozen and starved in its cold;
   I've followed my dreams by its thousand streams,
     I've toiled and moiled for its gold.

   "Look at my eyes -- been snow-blind twice; look where my foot's half gone;
   And that gruesome scar on my left cheek,
     where the frost-fiend bit to the bone.
   Each one a brand of this devil's land,
     where I've played and I've lost the game,
   A broken wreck with a craze for `hooch', and never a cent to my name.

   "This mining is only a gamble; the worst is as good as the best;
   I was in with the bunch and I might have come out right on top with the rest;
   With Cormack, Ladue and Macdonald -- O God! but it's hell to think
   Of the thousands and thousands I've squandered on cards and women and drink.

   "In the early days we were just a few, and we hunted and fished around,
   Nor dreamt by our lonely camp-fires of the wealth that lay under the ground.
   We traded in skins and whiskey, and I've often slept under the shade
   Of that lone birch tree on Bonanza, where the first big find was made.

   "We were just like a great big family, and every man had his squaw,
   And we lived such a wild, free, fearless life beyond the pale of the law;
   Till sudden there came a whisper, and it maddened us every man,
   And I got in on Bonanza before the big rush began.

   "Oh, those Dawson days, and the sin and the blaze,
     and the town all open wide!
   (If God made me in His likeness, sure He let the devil inside.)
   But we all were mad, both the good and the bad, and as for the women, well --
   No spot on the map in so short a space has hustled more souls to hell.

   "Money was just like dirt there, easy to get and to spend.
   I was all caked in on a dance-hall jade, but she shook me in the end.
   It put me queer, and for near a year I never drew sober breath,
   Till I found myself in the bughouse ward with a claim staked out on death.

   "Twenty years in the Yukon, struggling along its creeks;
   Roaming its giant valleys, scaling its god-like peaks;
   Bathed in its fiery sunsets, fighting its fiendish cold --
   Twenty years in the Yukon... twenty years -- and I'm old.

   "Old and weak, but no matter, there's `hooch' in the bottle still.
   I'll hitch up the dogs to-morrow, and mush down the trail to Bill.
   It's so long dark, and I'm lonesome -- I'll just lay down on the bed;
   To-morrow I'll go... to-morrow... I guess I'll play on the red.

   "... Come, Kit, your pony is saddled.
     I'm waiting, dear, in the court...
  ... Minnie, you devil, I'll kill you
     if you skip with that flossy sport...
  ... How much does it go to the pan, Bill?...
     play up, School, and play the game...
  ... Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name..."

        _This was the song of the parson's son, as he lay in his bunk alone,
        Ere the fire went out and the cold crept in,
          and his blue lips ceased to moan,
        And the hunger-maddened malamutes had torn him flesh from bone._




The Call of the Wild



   Have you gazed on naked grandeur where there's nothing else to gaze on,
    Set pieces and drop-curtain scenes galore,
   Big mountains heaved to heaven, which the blinding sunsets blazon,
    Black canyons where the rapids rip and roar?
   Have you swept the visioned valley
     with the green stream streaking through it,
    Searched the Vastness for a something you have lost?
   Have you strung your soul to silence?  Then for God's sake go and do it;
    Hear the challenge, learn the lesson, pay the cost.

   Have you wandered in the wilderness, the sagebrush desolation,
    The bunch-grass levels where the cattle graze?
   Have you whistled bits of rag-time at the end of all creation,
    And learned to know the desert's little ways?
   Have you camped upon the foothills, have you galloped o'er the ranges,
    Have you roamed the arid sun-lands through and through?
   Have you chummed up with the mesa?  Do you know its moods and changes?
    Then listen to the Wild -- it's calling you.

   Have you known the Great White Silence, not a snow-gemmed twig aquiver?
    (Eternal truths that shame our soothing lies.)
   Have you broken trail on snowshoes? mushed your huskies up the river,
    Dared the unknown, led the way, and clutched the prize?
   Have you marked the map's void spaces, mingled with the mongrel races,
    Felt the savage strength of brute in every thew?
   And though grim as hell the worst is, can you round it off with curses?
    Then hearken to the Wild -- it's wanting you.

   Have you suffered, starved and triumphed,
     groveled down, yet grasped at glory,
    Grown bigger in the bigness of the whole?
   "Done things" just for the doing, letting babblers tell the story,
    Seeing through the nice veneer the naked soul?
   Have you seen God in His splendors, heard the text that nature renders?
    (You'll never hear it in the family pew.)
   The simple things, the true things, the silent men who do things --
    Then listen to the Wild -- it's calling you.

   They have cradled you in custom, they have primed you with their preaching,
    They have soaked you in convention through and through;
   They have put you in a showcase; you're a credit to their teaching --
    But can't you hear the Wild? -- it's calling you.
   Let us probe the silent places, let us seek what luck betide us;
    Let us journey to a lonely land I know.
   There's a whisper on the night-wind, there's a star agleam to guide us,
    And the Wild is calling, calling... let us go.




The Lone Trail



        _Ye who know the Lone Trail fain would follow it,
        Though it lead to glory or the darkness of the pit.
        Ye who take the Lone Trail, bid your love good-by;
        The Lone Trail, the Lone Trail follow till you die._

   The trails of the world be countless, and most of the trails be tried;
   You tread on the heels of the many, till you come where the ways divide;
   And one lies safe in the sunlight, and the other is dreary and wan,
   Yet you look aslant at the Lone Trail, and the Lone Trail lures you on.
   And somehow you're sick of the highway, with its noise and its easy needs,
   And you seek the risk of the by-way, and you reck not where it leads.
   And sometimes it leads to the desert, and the tongue swells out of the mouth,
   And you stagger blind to the mirage, to die in the mocking drouth.
   And sometimes it leads to the mountain, to the light of the lone camp-fire,
   And you gnaw your belt in the anguish of hunger-goaded desire.
   And sometimes it leads to the Southland, to the swamp where the orchid glows,
   And you rave to your grave with the fever,
     and they rob the corpse for its clothes.
   And sometimes it leads to the Northland, and the scurvy softens your bones,
   And your flesh dints in like putty, and you spit out your teeth like stones.
   And sometimes it leads to a coral reef in the wash of a weedy sea,
   And you sit and stare at the empty glare where the gulls wait greedily.
   And sometimes it leads to an Arctic trail,
     and the snows where your torn feet freeze,
   And you whittle away the useless clay, and crawl on your hands and knees.
   Often it leads to the dead-pit; always it leads to pain;
   By the bones of your brothers ye know it, but oh, to follow you're fain.
   By your bones they will follow behind you,
     till the ways of the world are made plain.

        _Bid good-by to sweetheart, bid good-by to friend;
        The Lone Trail, the Lone Trail follow to the end.
        Tarry not, and fear not, chosen of the true;
        Lover of the Lone Trail, the Lone Trail waits for you._




The Pines



   We sleep in the sleep of ages, the bleak, barbarian pines;
   The gray moss drapes us like sages, and closer we lock our lines,
   And deeper we clutch through the gelid gloom where never a sunbeam shines.

   On the flanks of the storm-gored ridges are our black battalions massed;
   We surge in a host to the sullen coast, and we sing in the ocean blast;
   From empire of sea to empire of snow we grip our empire fast.

   To the niggard lands were we driven, 'twixt desert and floes are we penned;
   To us was the Northland given, ours to stronghold and defend;
   Ours till the world be riven in the crash of the utter end;

   Ours from the bleak beginning, through the aeons of death-like sleep;
   Ours from the shock when the naked rock was hurled from the hissing deep;
   Ours through the twilight ages of weary glacier creep.

   Wind of the East, Wind of the West, wandering to and fro,
   Chant your songs in our topmost boughs, that the sons of men may know
   The peerless pine was the first to come, and the pine will be last to go!

   We pillar the halls of perfumed gloom; we plume where the eagles soar;
   The North-wind swoops from the brooding Pole,
     and our ancients crash and roar;
   But where one falls from the crumbling walls shoots up a hardy score.

   We spring from the gloom of the canyon's womb; in the valley's lap we lie;
   From the white foam-fringe, where the breakers cringe
     to the peaks that tusk the sky,
   We climb, and we peer in the crag-locked mere that gleams like a golden eye.

   Gain to the verge of the hog-back ridge where the vision ranges free:
   Pines and pines and the shadow of pines as far as the eye can see;
   A steadfast legion of stalwart knights in dominant empery.

   Sun, moon and stars give answer; shall we not staunchly stand,
   Even as now, forever, wards of the wilder strand,
   Sentinels of the stillness, lords of the last, lone land?




The Lure of Little Voices



   There's a cry from out the loneliness -- oh, listen, Honey, listen!
    Do you hear it, do you fear it, you're a-holding of me so?
   You're a-sobbing in your sleep, dear, and your lashes, how they glisten --
    Do you hear the Little Voices all a-begging me to go?

   All a-begging me to leave you.  Day and night they're pleading, praying,
    On the North-wind, on the West-wind, from the peak and from the plain;
   Night and day they never leave me -- do you know what they are saying?
    "He was ours before you got him, and we want him once again."

   Yes, they're wanting me, they're haunting me, the awful lonely places;
    They're whining and they're whimpering as if each had a soul;
   They're calling from the wilderness, the vast and God-like spaces,
    The stark and sullen solitudes that sentinel the Pole.

   They miss my little camp-fires, ever brightly, bravely gleaming
    In the womb of desolation, where was never man before;
   As comradeless I sought them, lion-hearted, loving, dreaming,
    And they hailed me as a comrade, and they loved me evermore.

   And now they're all a-crying, and it's no use me denying;
    The spell of them is on me and I'm helpless as a child;
   My heart is aching, aching, but I hear them, sleeping, waking;
    It's the Lure of Little Voices, it's the mandate of the Wild.

   I'm afraid to tell you, Honey, I can take no bitter leaving;
    But softly in the sleep-time from your love I'll steal away.
   Oh, it's cruel, dearie, cruel, and it's God knows how I'm grieving;
    But His loneliness is calling, and He knows I must obey.




The Song of the Wage-Slave



   When the long, long day is over, and the Big Boss gives me my pay,
   I hope that it won't be hell-fire, as some of the parsons say.
   And I hope that it won't be heaven, with some of the parsons I've met --
   All I want is just quiet, just to rest and forget.
   Look at my face, toil-furrowed; look at my calloused hands;
   Master, I've done Thy bidding, wrought in Thy many lands --
   Wrought for the little masters, big-bellied they be, and rich;
   I've done their desire for a daily hire, and I die like a dog in a ditch.
   I have used the strength Thou hast given, Thou knowest I did not shirk;
   Threescore years of labor -- Thine be the long day's work.
   And now, Big Master, I'm broken and bent and twisted and scarred,
   But I've held my job, and Thou knowest, and Thou will not judge me hard.
   Thou knowest my sins are many, and often I've played the fool --
   Whiskey and cards and women, they made me the devil's tool.
   I was just like a child with money; I flung it away with a curse,
   Feasting a fawning parasite, or glutting a harlot's purse;
   Then back to the woods repentant, back to the mill or the mine,
   I, the worker of workers, everything in my line.
   Everything hard but headwork (I'd no more brains than a kid),
   A brute with brute strength to labor, doing as I was bid;
   Living in camps with men-folk, a lonely and loveless life;
   Never knew kiss of sweetheart, never caress of wife.
   A brute with brute strength to labor, and they were so far above --
   Yet I'd gladly have gone to the gallows for one little look of Love.
   I, with the strength of two men, savage and shy and wild --
   Yet how I'd ha' treasured a woman, and the sweet, warm kiss of a child!
   Well, 'tis Thy world, and Thou knowest.  I blaspheme and my ways be rude;
   But I've lived my life as I found it, and I've done my best to be good;
   I, the primitive toiler, half naked and grimed to the eyes,
   Sweating it deep in their ditches, swining it stark in their styes;
   Hurling down forests before me, spanning tumultuous streams;
   Down in the ditch building o'er me palaces fairer than dreams;
   Boring the rock to the ore-bed, driving the road through the fen,
   Resolute, dumb, uncomplaining, a man in a world of men.
   Master, I've filled my contract, wrought in Thy many lands;
   Not by my sins wilt Thou judge me, but by the work of my hands.
   Master, I've done Thy bidding, and the light is low in the west,
   And the long, long shift is over... Master, I've earned it -- Rest.




Grin



   If you're up against a bruiser and you're getting knocked about --
                                           Grin.
   If you're feeling pretty groggy, and you're licked beyond a doubt --
                                           Grin.
   Don't let him see you're funking, let him know with every clout,
   Though your face is battered to a pulp, your blooming heart is stout;
   Just stand upon your pins until the beggar knocks you out --
                                           And grin.
   This life's a bally battle, and the same advice holds true
                                           Of grin.
   If you're up against it badly, then it's only one on you,
                                           So grin.
   If the future's black as thunder, don't let people see you're blue;
   Just cultivate a cast-iron smile of joy the whole day through;
   If they call you "Little Sunshine", wish that _THEY'D_ no troubles, too --
                                           You may -- grin.
   Rise up in the morning with the will that, smooth or rough,
                                           You'll grin.
   Sink to sleep at midnight, and although you're feeling tough,
                                           Yet grin.
   There's nothing gained by whining, and you're not that kind of stuff;
   You're a fighter from away back, and you _WON'T_ take a rebuff;
   Your trouble is that you don't know when you have had enough --
                                           Don't give in.
   If Fate should down you, just get up and take another cuff;
   You may bank on it that there is no philosophy like bluff,
                                           And grin.




The Shooting of Dan McGrew



   A bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the Malamute saloon;
   The kid that handles the music-box was hitting a jag-time tune;
   Back of the bar, in a solo game, sat Dangerous Dan McGrew,
   And watching his luck was his light-o'-love, the lady that's known as Lou.

   When out of the night, which was fifty below, and into the din and the glare,
   There stumbled a miner fresh from the creeks, dog-dirty, and loaded for bear.
   He looked like a man with a foot in the grave
     and scarcely the strength of a louse,
   Yet he tilted a poke of dust on the bar,
     and he called for drinks for the house.
   There was none could place the stranger's face,
     though we searched ourselves for a clue;
   But we drank his health, and the last to drink was Dangerous Dan McGrew.

   There's men that somehow just grip your eyes,
     and hold them hard like a spell;
   And such was he, and he looked to me like a man who had lived in hell;
   With a face most hair, and the dreary stare of a dog whose day is done,
   As he watered the green stuff in his glass, and the drops fell one by one.
   Then I got to figgering who he was, and wondering what he'd do,
   And I turned my head -- and there watching him
     was the lady that's known as Lou.

   His eyes went rubbering round the room, and he seemed in a kind of daze,
   Till at last that old piano fell in the way of his wandering gaze.
   The rag-time kid was having a drink; there was no one else on the stool,
   So the stranger stumbles across the room, and flops down there like a fool.
   In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him sway;
   Then he clutched the keys with his talon hands
     -- my God! but that man could play.

   Were you ever out in the Great Alone, when the moon was awful clear,
   And the icy mountains hemmed you in with a silence you most could _HEAR_;
   With only the howl of a timber wolf, and you camped there in the cold,
   A half-dead thing in a stark, dead world, clean mad for the muck called gold;
   While high overhead, green, yellow and red,
     the North Lights swept in bars? --
   Then you've a haunch what the music meant...
     hunger and night and the stars.

   And hunger not of the belly kind, that's banished with bacon and beans,
   But the gnawing hunger of lonely men for a home and all that it means;
   For a fireside far from the cares that are, four walls and a roof above;
   But oh! so cramful of cosy joy, and crowned with a woman's love --
   A woman dearer than all the world, and true as Heaven is true --
   (God! how ghastly she looks through her rouge, --
     the lady that's known as Lou.)

   Then on a sudden the music changed, so soft that you scarce could hear;
   But you felt that your life had been looted clean
     of all that it once held dear;
   That someone had stolen the woman you loved; that her love was a devil's lie;
   That your guts were gone, and the best for you was to crawl away and die.
   'Twas the crowning cry of a heart's despair,
     and it thrilled you through and through --
   "I guess I'll make it a spread misere," said Dangerous Dan McGrew.

   The music almost died away... then it burst like a pent-up flood;
   And it seemed to say, "Repay, repay," and my eyes were blind with blood.
   The thought came back of an ancient wrong, and it stung like a frozen lash,
   And the lust awoke to kill, to kill...
     then the music stopped with a crash,
   And the stranger turned, and his eyes they burned in a most peculiar way;
   In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him sway;
   Then his lips went in in a kind of grin,
     and he spoke, and his voice was calm,
   And "Boys," says he, "you don't know me, and none of you care a damn;
   But I want to state, and my words are straight,
     and I'll bet my poke they're true,
   That one of you is a hound of hell... and that one is Dan McGrew."

   Then I ducked my head, and the lights went out,
     and two guns blazed in the dark,
   And a woman screamed, and the lights went up,
     and two men lay stiff and stark.
   Pitched on his head, and pumped full of lead, was Dangerous Dan McGrew,
   While the man from the creeks lay clutched to the breast
     of the lady that's known as Lou.

   These are the simple facts of the case, and I guess I ought to know.
   They say that the stranger was crazed with "hooch",
     and I'm not denying it's so.
   I'm not so wise as the lawyer guys, but strictly between us two --
   The woman that kissed him and -- pinched his poke --
     was the lady that's known as Lou.




The Cremation of Sam McGee



        _There are strange things done in the midnight sun
         By the men who moil for gold;
        The Arctic trails have their secret tales
         That would make your blood run cold;
        The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,
         But the queerest they ever did see
        Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
         I cremated Sam McGee._

   Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.
   Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows.
   He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;
   Though he'd often say in his homely way that he'd "sooner live in hell".

   On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail.
   Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven nail.
   If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see;
   It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.

   And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow,
   And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and toe,
   He turned to me, and "Cap," says he, "I'll cash in this trip, I guess;
   And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request."

   Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no;
     then he says with a sort of moan:
   "It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold
     till I'm chilled clean through to the bone.
   Yet 'tain't being dead -- it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains;
   So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains."

   A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;
   And we started on at the streak of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly pale.
   He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee;
   And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee.

   There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horror-driven,
   With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid, because of a promise given;
   It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say:
     "You may tax your brawn and brains,
   But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last remains."

   Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code.
   In the days to come, though my lips were dumb,
     in my heart how I cursed that load.
   In the long, long night, by the lone firelight,
     while the huskies, round in a ring,
   Howled out their woes to the homeless snows --
     O God! how I loathed the thing.

   And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;
   And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;
   The trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give in;
   And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin.

   Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;
   It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice it was called the "Alice May".
   And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum;
   Then "Here," said I, with a sudden cry, "is my cre-ma-tor-eum."

   Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;
   Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;
   The flames just soared, and the furnace roared --
     such a blaze you seldom see;
   And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee.

   Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;
   And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow.
   It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled
     down my cheeks, and I don't know why;
   And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky.

   I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;
   But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;
   I was sick with dread, but I bravely said:  "I'll just take a peep inside.
   I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked";...
     then the door I opened wide.

   And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar;
   And he wore a smile you could see a mile,
     and he said:  "Please close that door.
   It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm --
   Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee,
     it's the first time I've been warm."

        _There are strange things done in the midnight sun
         By the men who moil for gold;
        The Arctic trails have their secret tales
         That would make your blood run cold;
        The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,
         But the queerest they ever did see
        Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
         I cremated Sam McGee._




My Madonna



   I haled me a woman from the street,
    Shameless, but, oh, so fair!
   I bade her sit in the model's seat
    And I painted her sitting there.

   I hid all trace of her heart unclean;
    I painted a babe at her breast;
   I painted her as she might have been
    If the Worst had been the Best.

   She laughed at my picture and went away.
    Then came, with a knowing nod,
   A connoisseur, and I heard him say;
    "'Tis Mary, the Mother of God."

   So I painted a halo round her hair,
    And I sold her and took my fee,
   And she hangs in the church of Saint Hillaire,
    Where you and all may see.




Unforgotten



   I know a garden where the lilies gleam,
    And one who lingers in the sunshine there;
    She is than white-stoled lily far more fair,
   And oh, her eyes are heaven-lit with dream!

   I know a garret, cold and dark and drear,
    And one who toils and toils with tireless pen,
    Until his brave, sad eyes grow weary -- then
   He seeks the stars, pale, silent as a seer.

   And ah, it's strange; for, desolate and dim,
    Between these two there rolls an ocean wide;
    Yet he is in the garden by her side
   And she is in the garret there with him.




The Reckoning



   It's fine to have a blow-out in a fancy restaurant,
   With terrapin and canvas-back and all the wine you want;
   To enjoy the flowers and music, watch the pretty women pass,
   Smoke a choice cigar, and sip the wealthy water in your glass.
   It's bully in a high-toned joint to eat and drink your fill,
   But it's quite another matter when you
                                           Pay the bill.

   It's great to go out every night on fun or pleasure bent;
   To wear your glad rags always and to never save a cent;
   To drift along regardless, have a good time every trip;
   To hit the high spots sometimes, and to let your chances slip;
   To know you're acting foolish, yet to go on fooling still,
   Till Nature calls a show-down, and you
                                           Pay the bill.

   Time has got a little bill -- get wise while yet you may,
   For the debit side's increasing in a most alarming way;
   The things you had no right to do, the things you should have done,
   They're all put down; it's up to you to pay for every one.
   So eat, drink and be merry, have a good time if you will,
   But God help you when the time comes, and you
                                           Foot the bill.




Quatrains



   One said:  Thy life is thine to make or mar,
   To flicker feebly, or to soar, a star;
    It lies with thee -- the choice is thine, is thine,
   To hit the ties or drive thy auto-car.

   I answered Her:  The choice is mine -- ah, no!
   We all were made or marred long, long ago.
    The parts are written; hear the super wail:
   "Who is stage-managing this cosmic show?"

   Blind fools of fate and slaves of circumstance,
   Life is a fiddler, and we all must dance.
    From gloom where mocks that will-o'-wisp, Free-will
   I heard a voice cry:  "Say, give us a chance."

   Chance!  Oh, there is no chance!  The scene is set.
   Up with the curtain!  Man, the marionette,
    Resumes his part.  The gods will work the wires.
   They've got it all down fine, you bet, you bet!

   It's all decreed -- the mighty earthquake crash,
   The countless constellations' wheel and flash;
    The rise and fall of empires, war's red tide;
   The composition of your dinner hash.

   There's no haphazard in this world of ours.
   Cause and effect are grim, relentless powers.
    They rule the world.  (A king was shot last night;
   Last night I held the joker and both bowers.)

   From out the mesh of fate our heads we thrust.
   We can't do what we would, but what we must.
    Heredity has got us in a cinch --
   (Consoling thought when you've been on a "bust".)

   Hark to the song where spheral voices blend:
   "There's no beginning, never will be end."
    It makes us nutty; hang the astral chimes!
   The tables spread; come, let us dine, my friend.




The Men That Don't Fit In



   There's a race of men that don't fit in,
    A race that can't stay still;
   So they break the hearts of kith and kin,
    And they roam the world at will.
   They range the field and they rove the flood,
    And they climb the mountain's crest;
   Theirs is the curse of the gypsy blood,
    And they don't know how to rest.

   If they just went straight they might go far;
    They are strong and brave and true;
   But they're always tired of the things that are,
    And they want the strange and new.
   They say:  "Could I find my proper groove,
    What a deep mark I would make!"
   So they chop and change, and each fresh move
    Is only a fresh mistake.

   And each forgets, as he strips and runs
    With a brilliant, fitful pace,
   It's the steady, quiet, plodding ones
    Who win in the lifelong race.
   And each forgets that his youth has fled,
    Forgets that his prime is past,
   Till he stands one day, with a hope that's dead,
    In the glare of the truth at last.

   He has failed, he has failed; he has missed his chance;
    He has just done things by half.
   Life's been a jolly good joke on him,
    And now is the time to laugh.
   Ha, ha!  He is one of the Legion Lost;
    He was never meant to win;
   He's a rolling stone, and it's bred in the bone;
    He's a man who won't fit in.




Music in the Bush



   O'er the dark pines she sees the silver moon,
    And in the west, all tremulous, a star;
   And soothing sweet she hears the mellow tune
    Of cow-bells jangled in the fields afar.

   Quite listless, for her daily stent is done,
    She stands, sad exile, at her rose-wreathed door,
   And sends her love eternal with the sun
    That goes to gild the land she'll see no more.

   The grave, gaunt pines imprison her sad gaze,
    All still the sky and darkling drearily;
   She feels the chilly breath of dear, dead days
    Come sifting through the alders eerily.

   Oh, how the roses riot in their bloom!
    The curtains stir as with an ancient pain;
   Her old piano gleams from out the gloom
    And waits and waits her tender touch in vain.

   But now her hands like moonlight brush the keys
    With velvet grace -- melodious delight;
   And now a sad refrain from over seas
    Goes sobbing on the bosom of the night;

   And now she sings.  (O! singer in the gloom,
    Voicing a sorrow we can ne'er express,
   Here in the Farness where we few have room
    Unshamed to show our love and tenderness,

   Our hearts will echo, till they beat no more,
    That song of sadness and of motherland;
   And, stretched in deathless love to England's shore,
    Some day she'll hearken and she'll understand.)

   A prima-donna in the shining past,
    But now a mother growing old and gray,
   She thinks of how she held a people fast
    In thrall, and gleaned the triumphs of a day.

   She sees a sea of faces like a dream;
    She sees herself a queen of song once more;
   She sees lips part in rapture, eyes agleam;
    She sings as never once she sang before.

   She sings a wild, sweet song that throbs with pain,
    The added pain of life that transcends art --
   A song of home, a deep, celestial strain,
    The glorious swan-song of a dying heart.

   A lame tramp comes along the railway track,
    A grizzled dog whose day is nearly done;
   He passes, pauses, then comes slowly back
    And listens there -- an audience of one.

   She sings -- her golden voice is passion-fraught,
    As when she charmed a thousand eager ears;
   He listens trembling, and she knows it not,
    And down his hollow cheeks roll bitter tears.

   She ceases and is still, as if to pray;
    There is no sound, the stars are all alight --
   Only a wretch who stumbles on his way,
    Only a vagrant sobbing in the night.




The Rhyme of the Remittance Man



   There's a four-pronged buck a-swinging in the shadow of my cabin,
    And it roamed the velvet valley till to-day;
   But I tracked it by the river, and I trailed it in the cover,
    And I killed it on the mountain miles away.
   Now I've had my lazy supper, and the level sun is gleaming
    On the water where the silver salmon play;
   And I light my little corn-cob, and I linger, softly dreaming,
    In the twilight, of a land that's far away.

   Far away, so faint and far, is flaming London, fevered Paris,
    That I fancy I have gained another star;
   Far away the din and hurry, far away the sin and worry,
    Far away -- God knows they cannot be too far.
   Gilded galley-slaves of Mammon -- how my purse-proud brothers taunt me!
    I might have been as well-to-do as they
   Had I clutched like them my chances,
     learned their wisdom, crushed my fancies,
    Starved my soul and gone to business every day.

   Well, the cherry bends with blossom and the vivid grass is springing,
    And the star-like lily nestles in the green;
   And the frogs their joys are singing, and my heart in tune is ringing,
    And it doesn't matter what I might have been.
   While above the scented pine-gloom, piling heights of golden glory,
    The sun-god paints his canvas in the west,
   I can couch me deep in clover, I can listen to the story
    Of the lazy, lapping water -- it is best.

   While the trout leaps in the river, and the blue grouse thrills the cover,
    And the frozen snow betrays the panther's track,
   And the robin greets the dayspring with the rapture of a lover,
    I am happy, and I'll nevermore go back.
   For I know I'd just be longing for the little old log cabin,
    With the morning-glory clinging to the door,
   Till I loathed the city places, cursed the care on all the faces,
    Turned my back on lazar London evermore.

   So send me far from Lombard Street, and write me down a failure;
    Put a little in my purse and leave me free.
   Say:  "He turned from Fortune's offering to follow up a pale lure,
    He is one of us no longer -- let him be."
   I am one of you no longer; by the trails my feet have broken,
    The dizzy peaks I've scaled, the camp-fire's glow;
   By the lonely seas I've sailed in -- yea, the final word is spoken,
    I am signed and sealed to nature.  Be it so.




The Low-Down White



   This is the pay-day up at the mines, when the bearded brutes come down;
   There's money to burn in the streets to-night,
     so I've sent my klooch to town,
   With a haggard face and a ribband of red entwined in her hair of brown.

   And I know at the dawn she'll come reeling home
     with the bottles, one, two, three --
   One for herself, to drown her shame, and two big bottles for me,
   To make me forget the thing I am and the man I used to be.

   To make me forget the brand of the dog, as I crouch in this hideous place;
   To make me forget once I kindled the light of love in a lady's face,
   Where even the squalid Siwash now holds me a black disgrace.

   Oh, I have guarded my secret well!  And who would dream as I speak
   In a tribal tongue like a rogue unhung, 'mid the ranch-house filth and reek,
   I could roll to bed with a Latin phrase and rise with a verse of Greek?

   Yet I was a senior prizeman once, and the pride of a college eight;
   Called to the bar -- my friends were true!
     but they could not keep me straight;
   Then came the divorce, and I went abroad and "died" on the River Plate.

   But I'm not dead yet; though with half a lung there isn't time to spare,
   And I hope that the year will see me out, and, thank God, no one will care --
   Save maybe the little slim Siwash girl with the rose of shame in her hair.

   She will come with the dawn, and the dawn is near; I can see its evil glow,
   Like a corpse-light seen through a frosty pane in a night of want and woe;
   And yonder she comes by the bleak bull-pines,
     swift staggering through the snow.




The Little Old Log Cabin



   When a man gits on his uppers in a hard-pan sort of town,
    An' he ain't got nothin' comin' an' he can't afford ter eat,
   An' he's in a fix for lodgin' an' he wanders up an' down,
    An' you'd fancy he'd been boozin', he's so locoed 'bout the feet;
   When he's feelin' sneakin' sorry an' his belt is hangin' slack,
    An' his face is peaked an' gray-like an' his heart gits down an' whines,
   Then he's apt ter git a-thinkin' an' a-wishin' he was back
    In the little ol' log cabin in the shadder of the pines.

   When he's on the blazin' desert an' his canteen's sprung a leak,
    An' he's all alone an' crazy an' he's crawlin' like a snail,
   An' his tongue's so black an' swollen that it hurts him fer to speak,
    An' he gouges down fer water an' the raven's on his trail;
   When he's done with care and cursin' an' he feels more like to cry,
    An' he sees ol' Death a-grinnin' an' he thinks upon his crimes,
   Then he's like ter hev' a vision, as he settles down ter die,
    Of the little ol' log cabin an' the roses an' the vines.

   Oh, the little ol' log cabin, it's a solemn shinin' mark,
    When a feller gits ter sinnin' an' a-goin' ter the wall,
   An' folks don't understand him an' he's gropin' in the dark,
    An' he's sick of bein' cursed at an' he's longin' fer his call!
   When the sun of life's a-sinkin' you can see it 'way above,
    On the hill from out the shadder in a glory 'gin the sky,
   An' your mother's voice is callin', an' her arms are stretched in love,
    An' somehow you're glad you're goin', an' you ain't a-scared to die;
   When you'll be like a kid again an' nestle to her breast,
    An' never leave its shelter, an' forget, an' love, an' rest.




The Younger Son



   If you leave the gloom of London and you seek a glowing land,
    Where all except the flag is strange and new,
   There's a bronzed and stalwart fellow who will grip you by the hand,
    And greet you with a welcome warm and true;
   For he's your younger brother, the one you sent away
    Because there wasn't room for him at home;
   And now he's quite contented, and he's glad he didn't stay,
    And he's building Britain's greatness o'er the foam.

   When the giant herd is moving at the rising of the sun,
    And the prairie is lit with rose and gold,
   And the camp is all abustle, and the busy day's begun,
    He leaps into the saddle sure and bold.
   Through the round of heat and hurry, through the racket and the rout,
    He rattles at a pace that nothing mars;
   And when the night-winds whisper and camp-fires flicker out,
    He is sleeping like a child beneath the stars.

   When the wattle-blooms are drooping in the sombre she-oak glade,
    And the breathless land is lying in a swoon,
   He leaves his work a moment, leaning lightly on his spade,
    And he hears the bell-bird chime the Austral noon.
   The parrakeets are silent in the gum-tree by the creek;
    The ferny grove is sunshine-steeped and still;
   But the dew will gem the myrtle in the twilight ere he seek
    His little lonely cabin on the hill.

   Around the purple, vine-clad slope the argent river dreams;
    The roses almost hide the house from view;
   A snow-peak of the Winterberg in crimson splendor gleams;
    The shadow deepens down on the karroo.
   He seeks the lily-scented dusk beneath the orange tree;
    His pipe in silence glows and fades and glows;
   And then two little maids come out and climb upon his knee,
    And one is like the lily, one the rose.

   He sees his white sheep dapple o'er the green New Zealand plain,
    And where Vancouver's shaggy ramparts frown,
   When the sunlight threads the pine-gloom he is fighting might and main
    To clinch the rivets of an Empire down.
   You will find him toiling, toiling, in the south or in the west,
    A child of nature, fearless, frank, and free;
   And the warmest heart that beats for you is beating in his breast,
    And he sends you loyal greeting o'er the sea.

   You've a brother in the army, you've another in the Church;
    One of you is a diplomatic swell;
   You've had the pick of everything and left him in the lurch,
    And yet I think he's doing very well.
   I'm sure his life is happy, and he doesn't envy yours;
    I know he loves the land his pluck has won;
   And I fancy in the years unborn, while England's fame endures,
    She will come to bless with pride -- The Younger Son.




The March of the Dead



   The cruel war was over -- oh, the triumph was so sweet!
    We watched the troops returning, through our tears;
   There was triumph, triumph, triumph down the scarlet glittering street,
    And you scarce could hear the music for the cheers.
   And you scarce could see the house-tops for the flags that flew between;
    The bells were pealing madly to the sky;
   And everyone was shouting for the Soldiers of the Queen,
    And the glory of an age was passing by.

   And then there came a shadow, swift and sudden, dark and drear;
    The bells were silent, not an echo stirred.
   The flags were drooping sullenly, the men forgot to cheer;
    We waited, and we never spoke a word.
   The sky grew darker, darker, till from out the gloomy rack
    There came a voice that checked the heart with dread:
   "Tear down, tear down your bunting now, and hang up sable black;
    They are coming -- it's the Army of the Dead."

   They were coming, they were coming, gaunt and ghastly, sad and slow;
    They were coming, all the crimson wrecks of pride;
   With faces seared, and cheeks red smeared, and haunting eyes of woe,
    And clotted holes the khaki couldn't hide.
   Oh, the clammy brow of anguish! the livid, foam-flecked lips!
    The reeling ranks of ruin swept along!
   The limb that trailed, the hand that failed, the bloody finger tips!
    And oh, the dreary rhythm of their song!

   "They left us on the veldt-side, but we felt we couldn't stop
    On this, our England's crowning festal day;
   We're the men of Magersfontein, we're the men of Spion Kop,
    Colenso -- we're the men who had to pay.
   We're the men who paid the blood-price.  Shall the grave be all our gain?
    You owe us.  Long and heavy is the score.
   Then cheer us for our glory now, and cheer us for our pain,
    And cheer us as ye never cheered before."

   The folks were white and stricken, and each tongue seemed weighted with lead;
    Each heart was clutched in hollow hand of ice;
   And every eye was staring at the horror of the dead,
    The pity of the men who paid the price.
   They were come, were come to mock us, in the first flush of our peace;
    Through writhing lips their teeth were all agleam;
   They were coming in their thousands -- oh, would they never cease!
    I closed my eyes, and then -- it was a dream.

   There was triumph, triumph, triumph down the scarlet gleaming street;
    The town was mad; a man was like a boy.
   A thousand flags were flaming where the sky and city meet;
    A thousand bells were thundering the joy.
   There was music, mirth and sunshine; but some eyes shone with regret;
    And while we stun with cheers our homing braves,
   O God, in Thy great mercy, let us nevermore forget
    The graves they left behind, the bitter graves.




"Fighting Mac"

   A Life Tragedy



   A pistol shot rings round and round the world;
    In pitiful defeat a warrior lies.
   A last defiance to dark Death is hurled,
    A last wild challenge shocks the sunlit skies.
    Alone he falls, with wide, wan, woeful eyes:
   Eyes that could smile at death -- could not face shame.

   Alone, alone he paced his narrow room,
    In the bright sunshine of that Paris day;
   Saw in his thought the awful hand of doom;
    Saw in his dream his glory pass away;
    Tried in his heart, his weary heart, to pray:
   "O God! who made me, give me strength to face
   The spectre of this bitter, black disgrace."

        *    *    *    *    *

   The burn brawls darkly down the shaggy glen;
    The bee-kissed heather blooms around the door;
   He sees himself a barefoot boy again,
    Bending o'er page of legendary lore.
    He hears the pibroch, grips the red claymore,
   Runs with the Fiery Cross, a clansman true,
   Sworn kinsman of Rob Roy and Roderick Dhu.

   Eating his heart out with a wild desire,
    One day, behind his counter trim and neat,
   He hears a sound that sets his brain afire --
    The Highlanders are marching down the street.
    Oh, how the pipes shrill out, the mad drums beat!
   "On to the gates of Hell, my Gordons gay!"
   He flings his hated yardstick away.

   He sees the sullen pass, high-crowned with snow,
    Where Afghans cower with eyes of gleaming hate.
   He hurls himself against the hidden foe.
    They try to rally -- ah, too late, too late!
    Again, defenseless, with fierce eyes that wait
   For death, he stands, like baited bull at bay,
   And flouts the Boers, that mad Majuba day.

   He sees again the murderous Soudan,
    Blood-slaked and rapine-swept.  He seems to stand
   Upon the gory plain of Omdurman.
    Then Magersfontein, and supreme command
    Over his Highlanders.  To shake his hand
   A King is proud, and princes call him friend.
   And glory crowns his life -- and now the end,

   The awful end.  His eyes are dark with doom;
    He hears the shrapnel shrieking overhead;
   He sees the ravaged ranks, the flame-stabbed gloom.
    Oh, to have fallen! -- the battle-field his bed,
    With Wauchope and his glorious brother-dead.
   Why was he saved for this, for this?  And now
   He raises the revolver to his brow.

        *    *    *    *    *

   In many a Highland home, framed with rude art,
    You'll find his portrait, rough-hewn, stern and square;
   It's graven in the Fuyam fellah's heart;
    The Ghurka reads it at his evening prayer;
    The raw lands know it, where the fierce suns glare;
   The Dervish fears it.  Honor to his name
   Who holds aloft the shield of England's fame.

   Mourn for our hero, men of Northern race!
    We do not know his sin; we only know
   His sword was keen.  He laughed death in the face,
    And struck, for Empire's sake, a giant blow.
    His arm was strong.  Ah! well they learnt, the foe
   The echo of his deeds is ringing yet --
   Will ring for aye.  All else... let us forget.




The Woman and the Angel



   An angel was tired of heaven, as he lounged in the golden street;
   His halo was tilted sideways, and his harp lay mute at his feet;
   So the Master stooped in His pity, and gave him a pass to go,
   For the space of a moon, to the earth-world, to mix with the men below.

   He doffed his celestial garments, scarce waiting to lay them straight;
   He bade good by to Peter, who stood by the golden gate;
   The sexless singers of heaven chanted a fond farewell,
   And the imps looked up as they pattered on the red-hot flags of hell.

   Never was seen such an angel -- eyes of heavenly blue,
   Features that shamed Apollo, hair of a golden hue;
   The women simply adored him; his lips were like Cupid's bow;
   But he never ventured to use them -- and so they voted him slow.

   Till at last there came One Woman, a marvel of loveliness,
   And she whispered to him:  "Do you love me?"
     And he answered that woman, "Yes."
   And she said:  "Put your arms around me, and kiss me, and hold me -- so --"
   But fiercely he drew back, saying:  "This thing is wrong, and I know."

   Then sweetly she mocked his scruples, and softly she him beguiled:
   "You, who are verily man among men, speak with the tongue of a child.
   We have outlived the old standards; we have burst, like an over-tight thong,
   The ancient, outworn, Puritanic traditions of Right and Wrong."

   Then the Master feared for His angel, and called him again to His side,
   For oh, the woman was wondrous, and oh, the angel was tried!
   And deep in his hell sang the Devil, and this was the strain of his song:
   "The ancient, outworn, Puritanic traditions of Right and Wrong."




The Rhyme of the Restless Ones



   We couldn't sit and study for the law;
    The stagnation of a bank we couldn't stand;
   For our riot blood was surging, and we didn't need much urging
    To excitements and excesses that are banned.
   So we took to wine and drink and other things,
    And the devil in us struggled to be free;
   Till our friends rose up in wrath, and they pointed out the path,
    And they paid our debts and packed us o'er the sea.

   Oh, they shook us off and shipped us o'er the foam,
   To the larger lands that lure a man to roam;
    And we took the chance they gave
    Of a far and foreign grave,
   And we bade good-by for evermore to home.

   And some of us are climbing on the peak,
    And some of us are camping on the plain;
   By pine and palm you'll find us, with never claim to bind us,
    By track and trail you'll meet us once again.

   We are the fated serfs to freedom -- sky and sea;
    We have failed where slummy cities overflow;
   But the stranger ways of earth know our pride and know our worth,
    And we go into the dark as fighters go.

   Yes, we go into the night as brave men go,
   Though our faces they be often streaked with woe;
    Yet we're hard as cats to kill,
    And our hearts are reckless still,
   And we've danced with death a dozen times or so.

   And you'll find us in Alaska after gold,
    And you'll find us herding cattle in the South.
   We like strong drink and fun, and, when the race is run,
    We often die with curses in our mouth.
   We are wild as colts unbroke, but never mean.
    Of our sins we've shoulders broad to bear the blame;
   But we'll never stay in town and we'll never settle down,
    And we'll never have an object or an aim.

   No, there's that in us that time can never tame;
   And life will always seem a careless game;
    And they'd better far forget --
    Those who say they love us yet --
   Forget, blot out with bitterness our name.




New Year's Eve



   It's cruel cold on the water-front, silent and dark and drear;
    Only the black tide weltering, only the hissing snow;
   And I, alone, like a storm-tossed wreck, on this night of the glad New Year,
    Shuffling along in the icy wind, ghastly and gaunt and slow.

   They're playing a tune in McGuffy's saloon,
     and it's cheery and bright in there
    (God! but I'm weak -- since the bitter dawn, and never a bite of food);
   I'll just go over and slip inside -- I mustn't give way to despair --
    Perhaps I can bum a little booze if the boys are feeling good.

   They'll jeer at me, and they'll sneer at me,
     and they'll call me a whiskey soak;
    ("Have a drink?  Well, thankee kindly, sir, I don't mind if I do.")
   A drivelling, dirty, gin-joint fiend, the butt of the bar-room joke;
    Sunk and sodden and hopeless -- "Another?  Well, here's to you!"

   McGuffy is showing a bunch of the boys how Bob Fitzsimmons hit;
    The barman is talking of Tammany Hall, and why the ward boss got fired.
   I'll just sneak into a corner and they'll let me alone a bit;
    The room is reeling round and round...
      O God! but I'm tired, I'm tired....

        *    *    *    *    *

   Roses she wore on her breast that night.  Oh, but their scent was sweet!
    Alone we sat on the balcony, and the fan-palms arched above;
   The witching strain of a waltz by Strauss came up to our cool retreat,
    And I prisoned her little hand in mine, and I whispered my plea of love.

   Then sudden the laughter died on her lips, and lowly she bent her head;
    And oh, there came in the deep, dark eyes a look that was heaven to see;
   And the moments went, and I waited there, and never a word was said,
    And she plucked from her bosom a rose of red and shyly gave it to me.

   Then the music swelled to a crash of joy, and the lights blazed up like day,
    And I held her fast to my throbbing heart, and I kissed her bonny brow.
   "She is mine, she is mine for evermore!" the violins seemed to say,
    And the bells were ringing the New Year in -- O God! I can hear them now.

   Don't you remember that long, last waltz, with its sobbing, sad refrain?
    Don't you remember that last good-by, and the dear eyes dim with tears?
   Don't you remember that golden dream, with never a hint of pain,
    Of lives that would blend like an angel-song
      in the bliss of the coming years?

   Oh, what have I lost!  What have I lost!  Ethel, forgive, forgive!
    The red, red rose is faded now, and it's fifty years ago.
   'Twere better to die a thousand deaths than live each day as I live!
    I have sinned, I have sunk to the lowest depths --
      but oh, I have suffered so!

   Hark!  Oh, hark!  I can hear the bells!...  Look! I can see her there,
    Fair as a dream... but it fades... And now --
      I can hear the dreadful hum
   Of the crowded court... See! the Judge looks down...
     _NOT GUILTY_, my Lord, I swear...
    The bells -- I can hear the bells again!...  Ethel, I come, I come!...

        *    *    *    *    *

   "Rouse up, old man, it's twelve o'clock.  You can't sleep here, you know.
    Say! ain't you got no sentiment?  Lift up your muddled head;
   Have a drink to the glad New Year, a drop before you go --
    You darned old dirty hobo... My God!  Here, boys!  He's _DEAD!_"




Comfort



   Say!  You've struck a heap of trouble --
    Bust in business, lost your wife;
   No one cares a cent about you,
    You don't care a cent for life;
   Hard luck has of hope bereft you,
    Health is failing, wish you'd die --
   Why, you've still the sunshine left you
    And the big, blue sky.

   Sky so blue it makes you wonder
    If it's heaven shining through;
   Earth so smiling 'way out yonder,
    Sun so bright it dazzles you;
   Birds a-singing, flowers a-flinging
    All their fragrance on the breeze;
   Dancing shadows, green, still meadows --
    Don't you mope, you've still got these.

   These, and none can take them from you;
    These, and none can weigh their worth.
   What! you're tired and broke and beaten? --
    Why, you're rich -- you've got the earth!
   Yes, if you're a tramp in tatters,
    While the blue sky bends above
   You've got nearly all that matters --
    You've got God, and God is love.




The Harpy



        There was a woman, and she was wise; woefully wise was she;
        She was old, so old, yet her years all told were but a score and three;
        And she knew by heart, from finish to start, the Book of Iniquity.

   There is no hope for such as I on earth, nor yet in Heaven;
   Unloved I live, unloved I die, unpitied, unforgiven;
   A loathed jade, I ply my trade, unhallowed and unshriven.

   I paint my cheeks, for they are white, and cheeks of chalk men hate;
   Mine eyes with wine I make them shine, that man may seek and sate;
   With overhead a lamp of red I sit me down and wait

   Until they come, the nightly scum, with drunken eyes aflame;
   Your sweethearts, sons, ye scornful ones -- 'tis I who know their shame.
   The gods, ye see, are brutes to me -- and so I play my game.

   For life is not the thing we thought, and not the thing we plan;
   And Woman in a bitter world must do the best she can --
   Must yield the stroke, and bear the yoke, and serve the will of man;

   Must serve his need and ever feed the flame of his desire,
   Though be she loved for love alone, or be she loved for hire;
   For every man since life began is tainted with the mire.

   And though you know he love you so and set you on love's throne;
   Yet let your eyes but mock his sighs, and let your heart be stone,
   Lest you be left (as I was left) attainted and alone.

   From love's close kiss to hell's abyss is one sheer flight, I trow,
   And wedding ring and bridal bell are will-o'-wisps of woe,
   And 'tis not wise to love too well, and this all women know.

   Wherefore, the wolf-pack having gorged upon the lamb, their prey,
   With siren smile and serpent guile I make the wolf-pack pay --
   With velvet paws and flensing claws, a tigress roused to slay.

   One who in youth sought truest truth and found a devil's lies;
   A symbol of the sin of man, a human sacrifice.
   Yet shall I blame on man the shame?  Could it be otherwise?

   Was I not born to walk in scorn where others walk in pride?
   The Maker marred, and, evil-starred, I drift upon His tide;
   And He alone shall judge His own, so I His judgment bide.

        Fate has written a tragedy; its name is "The Human Heart".
        The Theatre is the House of Life, Woman the mummer's part;
        The Devil enters the prompter's box and the play is ready to start.




Premonition



   'Twas a year ago and the moon was bright
    (Oh, I remember so well, so well);
   I walked with my love in a sea of light,
    And the voice of my sweet was a silver bell.
       And sudden the moon grew strangely dull,
        And sudden my love had taken wing;
       I looked on the face of a grinning skull,
        I strained to my heart a ghastly thing.

   'Twas but fantasy, for my love lay still
    In my arms, with her tender eyes aglow,
   And she wondered why my lips were chill,
    Why I was silent and kissed her so.
       A year has gone and the moon is bright,
        A gibbous moon, like a ghost of woe;
       I sit by a new-made grave to-night,
        And my heart is broken -- it's strange, you know.




The Tramps



   Can you recall, dear comrade, when we tramped God's land together,
    And we sang the old, old Earth-song, for our youth was very sweet;
   When we drank and fought and lusted, as we mocked at tie and tether,
    Along the road to Anywhere, the wide world at our feet --

   Along the road to Anywhere, when each day had its story;
    When time was yet our vassal, and life's jest was still unstale;
   When peace unfathomed filled our hearts as, bathed in amber glory,
    Along the road to Anywhere we watched the sunsets pale?

   Alas! the road to Anywhere is pitfalled with disaster;
    There's hunger, want, and weariness, yet O we loved it so!
   As on we tramped exultantly, and no man was our master,
    And no man guessed what dreams were ours, as, swinging heel and toe,
   We tramped the road to Anywhere, the magic road to Anywhere,
    The tragic road to Anywhere, such dear, dim years ago.




L'Envoi



     You who have lived in the land,
      You who have trusted the trail,
     You who are strong to withstand,
      You who are swift to assail:
          _Songs have I sung to beguile,
           Vintage of desperate years,
          Hard as a harlot's smile,
           Bitter as unshed tears._

     Little of joy or mirth,
      Little of ease I sing;
     Sagas of men of earth
      Humanly suffering,
          _Such as you all have done;
           Savagely faring forth,
          Sons of the midnight sun,
           Argonauts of the North._

     Far in the land God forgot
      Glimmers the lure of your trail;
     Still in your lust are you taught
      Even to win is to fail.
          _Still you must follow and fight
           Under the vampire wing;
          There in the long, long night
           Hoping and vanquishing._

     Husbandman of the Wild,
      Reaping a barren gain;
     Scourged by desire, reconciled
      Unto disaster and pain;
          _These, my songs, are for you,
           You who are seared with the brand.
          God knows I have tried to be true;
           Please God you will understand._
