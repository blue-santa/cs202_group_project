paced narrow room bright sunshine paris ; thought awful hand doom ; dream glory pass away ; tried heart weary heart pray : o god 
made give strength face spectre bitter black disgrace 
burn brawls darkly shaggy glen bee kissed heather blooms door ; sees barefoot boy bending o'er page legendary lore 
hears pibroch grips red claymore runs fiery cross clansman true sworn kinsman rob roy roderick dhu 
eating heart wild desire counter trim neat hears sound sets brain afire highlanders marching street 
oh pipes shrill mad drums beat 
gates hell gordons gay 
flings hated yardstick away 
sees sullen pass high crowned snow afghans cower eyes gleaming hate 
hurls hidden foe 
try rally ah late late 
defenceless fierce eyes wait death stands baited bull bay flouts boers mad majuba 
sees murderous soudan blood slaked rapine swept 
stand gory plain omdurman 
magersfontein supreme command highlanders 
shake hand king proud princes call friend glory crowns life end 
awful end 
eyes dark doom ; hears shrapnel shrieking overhead : sees ravaged ranks flame stabbed gloom 
oh fallen 
battle field bed wauchope glorious brother dead 
saved 
raises revolver brow 
highland home framed rude art you'll find portrait rough hewn stern square : it's graven fuyam fellah's heart ; ghurka reads evening prayer ; raw lands know fierce suns glare ; dervish fears 
honour name holds aloft shield england's fame 
mourn hero men northern race 
know sin ; know sword keen 
laughed death face struck empire's giant blow 
arm strong 
ah 
learnt foe 
echo deeds ringing ring aye 
forget 
woman angel angel tired heaven lounged golden street ; halo tilted harp lay mute feet ; master stooped pity gave pass space moon earth world mix men 
doffed celestial garments scarce waiting lay straight ; bade goodbye peter stood golden gate ; sexless singers heaven chanted fond farewell imps looked pattered red hot flags hell 
angel : eyes heavenly blue features shamed apollo hair golden hue ; women simply adored lips cupid's bow ; ventured voted slow 
came woman marvel loveliness whispered : love 
answered woman yes 
: put arms kiss hold fiercely drew back saying : thing wrong know 
sweetly mocked scruples softly beguiled : verily man men speak tongue child 
outlived old standards ; burst tight thong ancient outworn puritanic traditions right wrong 
master feared angel called side oh woman wondrous oh angel tried 
deep hell devil strain song : ancient outworn puritanic traditions right wrong 
rhyme restless ones couldn't sit study law ; stagnation bank couldn't stand ; riot blood surging didn't urging excitements excesses banned 
took wine drink things devil struggled free ; friends rose wrath pointed path paid debts packed o'er sea 
oh shook shipped o'er foam larger lands lure man roam ; took chance gave foreign grave bade goodbye evermore home 
climbing peak camping plain ; pine palm you'll find claim bind track trail you'll meet 
fated serfs freedom sky sea ; failed slummy cities overflow ; stranger ways earth know pride know worth dark fighters 
yes night brave men faces streaked woe ; we're hard cats kill hearts reckless we've danced death dozen times 
you'll find alaska gold you'll find herding cattle south 
strong drink fun ; race run die curses mouth 
wild colts unbroke mean ; sins we've shoulders broad bear blame ; we'll stay town we'll settle we'll object aim 
there's time tame ; life careless game ; they'd better forget say love forget blot bitterness name 
new year's eve it's cruel cold water silent dark drear ; black tide weltering hissing snow ; storm tossed wreck night glad new shuffling icy wind ghastly gaunt slow 
they're playing tune mcguffy's saloon it's cheery bright ( god 
i'm weak bitter dawn bite food ) ; i'll slip mustn't give way despair bum booze boys feeling good 
they'll jeer they'll sneer they'll call whiskey soak ; ( drink 
thankee kindly sir don't mind ) 
drivelling dirty gin joint fiend butt bar room joke ; sunk sodden hopeless 
here's 
mcguffy showing bunch boys bob fitzsimmons hit ; barman talking tammany hall ward boss got fired ; i'll sneak corner they'll bit ; room reeling 
o god i'm tired i'm tired 
roses wore breast night 
oh scent sweet ; sat balcony fan palms arched ; witching strain waltz strauss came cool retreat prisoned hand mine whispered plea love 
sudden laughter died lips lowly bent head ; oh came deep dark eyes look heaven moments went waited word plucked bosom rose red shyly gave 
music swelled crash joy lights blazed ; held fast throbbing heart kissed bonny brow ; mine mine evermore 
violins say bells ringing new o god 
hear 
don't remember long waltz sobbing sad refrain 
don't remember goodbye dear eyes dim tears 
don't remember golden dream hint pain lives blend angel song bliss coming 
oh lost 
lost 
ethel forgive forgive 
red red rose faded it's fifty years ago 
twere better die thousand deaths live live 
sinned sunk lowest depths oh suffered 
hark 
oh hark 
hear bells 
look 
fair dream fades 
hear dreadful hum crowded court 
judge looks 
guilty lord swear

boys 
he's dead 
comfort say 
you've struck heap trouble bust business lost wife ; cares cent don't care cent life ; hard luck hope bereft health failing wish you'd die you've sunshine left big blue sky 
sky blue makes wonder it's heaven shining ; earth smiling way yonder sun bright dazzles ; birds singing flowers flinging fragrance breeze ; dancing shadows green meadows don't mope you've got 
take ; weigh worth 
you're tired broke beaten you're rich you've got earth 
yes you're tramp tatters blue sky bends you've got nearly matters you've got god god love 
premonition twas ago moon bright ( oh remember ) walked love sea light voice sweet silver bell 
sudden moon grew strangely dull sudden love taken wing ; looked face grinning skull strained heart ghastly thing 
twas fantasy love lay arms tender eyes aglow wondered lips chill silent kissed 
gone moon bright gibbous moon ghost woe ; sit new made grave night heart broken it's strange know 
tramps recall dear comrade tramped god's land old old earth song youth sweet ; drank fought lusted mocked tie tether road wide world feet
